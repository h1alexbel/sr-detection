# @todo #5:30min Make rultor merge script more strict.
#  Let's incorporate more serious and strict build procedures. We should

# @todo #5:30min Create release script for whole project.
#  Let's create a one for the whole project, including all modules.
#  We should release all the modules: `sr-data|train|detector` to the PyPI. By
#  doing so, we should ensure that `sr-detector` is available to be installed
#  as standalone CLI tool. For `sr-data` and `sr-train` we should output some
#  prominent files like CSV files and model files. Let's skip sr-paper for now.
